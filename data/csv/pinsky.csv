I was very glad to be at Berkeley after the&#8212;for me, kind of tedious&#8212;Wellesley College, where I taught. I found Wellesley wasn't like going to jail, but it was a little New England Women's college. So I was very happy to be at Berkeley and that euphoria lasted for weeks and then Berkeley also came to seem very much like&#8212;how can I put this&#8212;an English department. And the phone rang and it was somebody named Ihor Wolosenko&#8212;the first person and the last person I have known named Ihor&#8212;Ihor Wolosenko from Synapse Software.

I said, ""No.""  He said, ""Have you ever heard of a game called Zork?""  I said, ""No.""  He said, ""It's a text that appears on the screen and you can go North or South or East or West, and you can pick up objects. It's a form of narrative.

They didn't pay for their phone service&#8212;they had different ways they could pirate phone service and had little machines that made long distance tones.

I always called it a game, and they always called it an ""electronic novel."" At the beginning Dr. Virgil puts the electrodes in your head and then you travel through the minds of a kind of Shakespeare/Dante figure; a kind of political rock figure, vaguely John Lennon like; a woman who is kind of an Einstein.

It comes from Sir Walter Raleigh's poem ""On the Cards and Dice,"" and it says, ""An herald strange, the like was never born, whose very beard is flesh and mouth is horn.""  You had to solve that riddle. And the Raleigh poem which is there, it's about the Cards and Dice, and it says, ""The trump will be heard and dead bones will jump up, will be rattled and men will groan and four kings will be gathered and four queens.""  So, it sounds like a mystic prophesy, but it's the cards and dice.

[00:24:20],RP:,"As I said, for a good period, I was one of the few people in the country who was writing everything I was writing to read off a screen on a computer, and everything I was writing to read on paper on paper. The Times asked me to review a book of prose by Philip Larkin. I was having a little trouble getting started with it and I had been writing this very fluid Bubble World of computer. I couldn't get started on the Larkin so I decided I'll experiment. I'll see if I can write the lead on the computer, on the monochrome, because it's so much less real than a pen or the typewriter.",software; early;highlight,,1460

I drove over to El Cerrito, to that office park where Synapse had its offices, right next to an old company named Pixel. I used my 5.25"" floppy to print out my book review. And it dawned on me, ""You're going to have to get a printer. In fact, you are going to have to get a better computer."" So, within, I can't remember, probably a few weeks, I had a jerky, junkie Dot Matrix printer and what we used to call a PC clone&#8212;IBM clone&#8212;called a Corona.

What I could do that I felt not everybody could do had to do with the sounds of sentences like that thing we just watched on TV.

,DB:,How did you come to figure out that you could do that better than other people?,,,
[00:31:12],RP:,"Probably in the course of college. But I remember that as a kid I would try to tap out the rhythm of sentences with my fingers. I thought about things like voiced and unvoiced consonants before I knew the word for them. I had been thinking about the difference between the ‘th' in ""the"" and the ‘th' in thin. ""The""&#8212;you use your voice box. ""Thin""&#8212;you don't. I wasn't sure...it seems like a bad habit in a way. But I thought about the sense of words. So, it's not a surprise to me that I was good at it when I discovered there was an art based on such things.",prompt;early,,1872
,DB:,I guess the question is then how you kind of developed?  You had that sort of innate talent. What were the steps you took to develop that talent?,prompt;early;career,,
,RP:,"Reading. I had great teachers. My freshman English teacher was Paul Fussell, and he asked us to read ABC of Reading by Ezra Pound. I read Yeats and Eliot and Ginsberg and Bishop. And I recognized the way the sounds of words were doing things in those writers. William Carlos Williams and William Butler Yeats and Emily Dickinson. I was less interested in the differences among them than the thing I saw going on in all of them. I was interested by that thing.",prompt;early;career,,
,DB:,"Yes. That's such a better way to get into it. When you started to kind of compose the poems and they became more important to you personally but also important to your career and moving forward, what were the ways you were working on them?  Were they always kind of appearing in your head? You'd write them down by hand and then type them up for other people? What was the process there?",prompt;early;career,,
,RP:,"I've had these ideas floating around in my head for a long time. A certain sense of ideas, like ""humble things have histories.""  ""What were the first things you ever saw made out of plastic in your own life?""  Cheap shit from Japan after the war&#8212;toys mostly. Plastic soldiers, metal soldiers, saw dust soldiers. During a war, you couldn't get them. So I would think about those substances.",prompt;early;career,,
,,"Those ideas, that set of ideas about different materials. That's all just thoughts. At the same time, I'd be mixing up my own personal history. The time I left some sawdust soldiers&#8212;pressed-wood soldiers&#8212;out overnight and they swelled-up. And then a completely other set of ideas that might involve war and the fascination of war. I had an uncle who was in the ""Battle of The Bulge."" He was a radio man, and I remember being very tiny and being fascinated by his massive boots. He's wearing the boots and I'm on the rug, touching those big boots. And none of that's the poem. That's memories, thoughts, ideas. And then the poem is when you start putting some sounds together. Something unnatural about the way a sawdust soldier will swell in the rain, unlike the boots of my uncle.",prompt;early;career,,
,,"It's not an existing poem by the way. I can give a little demo. The poem starts when you start thinking about the vowels and consonants. With ""uncle""&#8212;you rearrange the consonants. ""Unclean"" and ""calendar."" ""The calendar of childhood."" Then the time between the day that you find out wooden soldiers get ruined and the day that your mother and grandmother both dreamed that Julian was in trouble, and negligent memories of unclean...blah, blah, blah. That's the material.",prompt;early;career,,
[00:38:13],DB:,"Yes. That's the material. I guess the purpose of these interviews is kind of to think about how that material becomes the book in all its iterations, and how that has changed over the course of time as to how many computers you think you've owned, how many different writing devices. Stuff like that. If you compose it in your head, does that mean you have whole poems in your head before you write them down?",prompt; early,,2293
,RP:,"Sometimes, but more often I'll get enough lines to want to make a draft. So I'll write them down and I'll look at those and recite to myself the different things I've written down, and then I'll decide to type it into a document that I can print out. And then I'll read that over and maybe get a new idea.",prompt; early,,

But I can remember before the IBM liftoff, I can remember using&#8212;and they even made it double-space, or sort of single-space, I believe&#8212;correction tape. So, you could take a passage that you wanted to change and you glue the tape down and you might use a Xerox machine. You would do white out so the tape didn't leave a tell tale grey outline.

Now, I've met an editor who said she thinks prose declined&#8212;people started writing much more poorly&#8212;when the computer made it so easy to insert passages. That it led people&#8212;rather than concentrating on editing and cutting and sculpting their prose&#8212;to insert. That every sentence got a little bloated.",prompt; early;highlight,,

Proportional spacing came along within a decade or two and made nonsense of that. To me, the graphic thing&#8212;people talk about lining endings quite a lot. I always feel, ""No, I don't write line endings, I write lines"" and it's the whole line. I guess you could say I'm kind of an extremist and very resistant to the visual idea of the poem. Different technologies give people the illusion that poetry is a form of graphics, and I guess for them it is.",prompt; early;change;highlight,,

Why don't they correct the fact that still, I think, FSG won't publish poems in an electronic e-book edition because, somehow, nobody has come up with a way to preserve the integrity of the lines.

,RP:,"I think there were some moment when I was reading ""Howl"" and ""Sailing to Byzantium"" and Dickinson, and I felt this reality in those things that was different from the reality of Alan's typewriter going staccato. It was different from the reality of reading Ulysses or Dubliners. That was a very powerful reality produced by those rectangular blocks of print and the pages. This was more physical in some way. More bodily, let's say.",highlight;career,,
,,"So it maybe made me ripe for Winters, and he certainly amplified it by inviting me to learn something about George Gascoigne, Fulke Greville, and Philip Sidney, ?Brohly?. But I think it happened when I was in my late teens still, and, you know, Gingsberg was obsessed by blank verse by Elliot, and he'd give himself these exercises in it. So, it was&#8212;as is Williams, in a completely different way&#8212;it was free verse that was intensely oral. William calls all those poems ""metric figure,"" and obviously metric figure is about their attempts to write intense rhythms that are not iambic or blank verse.",highlight;career,,

,,"I guess the kind of overarching question that I'm wondering is&#8212;and as a digital librarian and someone who is working in the digital new, who can't really remember ever not writing on a computer&#8212;when the computer came in, when the Atari came in, and when the screens started appearing in front of you and the ease of those deletions and insertions and re-arrangements became possible, did that change the way you worked? Did that change what you produced?",highlight;career,,
,RP:,"I don't think it changed what I produced, but I think that it was the beginning of a different kind of archival anxiety. There is the archival anxiety about paperwork being preserved, given some manuscript or somebody else's manuscript being destroyed. I'm of a generation where I save magazines that I have work in&#8212;that's the old anxiety. And the new anxiety is the mortality of digital information. I can remember the Library of Congress saying to me that the only way to preserve digital material is to reproduce it. Unlike papyrus, it's mortal. It turns to mush. And that's aside from the fact that the medium keeps changing. The Favorite Poem Project videos&#8212;today I talked about somebody who is going to take the original digital tapes and make them into a current high definition format rather than the flash format they're in.",highlight;future;career,,

,RP:,"Yeah, on the website. But the website will be enhanced. You'll to be able to make them full screen. For seven years I was in NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. When Frank Sinatra died, I read passages from Virgil about the death of a singer. When the stock market was in trouble, I read Frost's ""Provide, Provide."" At the time, the places I recorded those would give me dumps on VHS tape. Where are they? Where is that material? There's a lot of it. I anxious this has gone into the ether. I was a Poetry Editor for Slate for many years. They eventually found poetry was not bringing enough ""hits,"" enough money and ads and things, so they stopped doing it. To preserve it for awhile, there were years when I would do a poem out-of-copyright, a classic poem. I'd do, say, an early poem by Marianne Moore.",highlight;future;career,,
,DB:,It's how I was introduced to Fulke Greville.,highlight;future;career,,
,RP:,"So I did those. I was shocked to learn that, unlike almost everything, like all kinds of pornography and ads and stuff, they're gone. They're irretrievable. Those discussions&#8212;and so many are with well known poets and critics taking part in them&#8212;they're gone. Vanished.",highlight;future;career,,

You know, there's the large view, but there's also personal, temporal anxiety. One has mixed emotions when, you know&#8212;my papers are at Stanford. They bought up to a certain year of paper-papers, but a librarian at Stanford said to me, ""I hope you're saving your email. I hope you're saving your electronic emails."" There's a new anxiety there. What in there that I wouldn't want quoted will come out in a journal? So, there is the anxiety of what could be lost and the anxiety of what could be preserved that you don't want preserved. There is the anxiety of&#8212;the family level is only metaphor for the whole thing. I share some photographs with my great grandparents' generation and these are photographs of your grandparents' generation that you treasure. We all have a camera in our pocket. It shoots video.

You better think about what time capsule you create. And as I say, that's only a metaphor for the larger question you're dealing with. In one of my poems, ""The Forgetting""&#8212;",future,,
,DB:,Which book is that in?,future,,
[00:51:35],RP:,"In Gulf Music, I say, Ezra Pound praised the emperor who appointed a committee of scholars to choose the advocate who has the 1,000 best Noh dramas and destroy the others for the good of the Noh. Ezra Pound approved of that, the fascist. So I was trying to express ambivalence about the winnowing process and the selecting process. The Library of Congress has to decide which sitcoms it will preserve, which commercials. Some of those commercials and sitcoms may be superior works of art to poetry by people who win the Pulitzer Prize. Who decides?",future,,3095

,RP:,"The papers&#8212;every so often, I'll accumulate enough and shoot them off to Palo Alto. Electronically, I mean... As it happens, in the last few months, somebody&#8212;it happened twice, that a poem of mine that I didn't choose to put in the selected&#8212;somebody said to me, ""This poem of yours means a lot to me.""  I remember the poem very well. It's a poem called ""The Reasons.""  This person said, ""It's a poem that, when I think about my ethnicity, the way you deal with ethnicity is very important to me."" But I felt maybe I shouldn't put in the selected, and I didn't.",future,,
,,"Then online, someone I have never met personally pointed to another poem because I'd published it in poetry magazine when I was in my 20s. It was on the Poetry magazine website, and she said how much she liked it. I looked it up and thought, ""Pretty good.""  I'd never put it in any book. I had forgotten it entirely. So, I don't know how that's germane to your question, but it is germane, somehow.",future,,
,DB:,"No, I think so.",future,,
,RP:,"That there is no ultimate authority for that selection process, the author included.",future,,
[00:54:28],DB:,"Ok. So you have these digital files that contain the poem and you've backed them up and you try to make sure they're okay. Do you feel some sort of ""dearness"" towards them? Or do you feel that they're sort of just a means to something else, somewhere else?",files;future,,3268
,RP:,"A lot of it is mechanical. A lot of it is in reflecting. I have many, many folders. I'm sort of a quasi-organized person. So, under ""Documents"" in my hard drive&#8212;which is then backed up in my backup drive&#8212;under ""Documents,"" there are many, many folders, letters from different years; prose. Probably thirty&#8212;I haven't counted them. There is one called ""Drafts.""  In ""Drafts,"" under sub-folders, for most poems there's that ""DR1,"" ""DR12,"" ""DR14."" I look at it and I sometimes feel the way I told you I feel about the family photographs. Nobody wants all this. Bishop has a poem about the umbrella that was so hard to make and the leather trousers, how they gave them to the local museum. How can anybody want such things? I'm sure she's thinking about drafts and memorabilia and so forth. It's just another anxiety. I can't say I think about it a lot, but I'm ambivalent when I think about all those megabytes of drafts. And two separate questions are: do I want anyone to look at them, and who could possibly want to look at them? But I don't destroy them and I do, somewhat mechanically, shoot the drafts into drafts. I guess part of the theory is I might want to look. And I suppose every once in many, many months, I do look.",files;future,,

So you'll have ""Mech Pencil DR1.docx"" or ""Mech Pencil DR6.docx,"" ""Mech Pencil 47""&#8212;and maybe not every single one is saved, but those are, and they're all going into that folder. In the main file, which is the next book&#8212;in whatever that folder is, you have the separate poems.",files;future,,

I don't think anybody knows where it's going, exactly. I recently spent a few days in New York. It's pleasing to see the people with a book in the subway, a magazine or a newspaper, but most people who are looking at something are looking at the screen. I'm surprised how many are looking at tablets. Lots are looking at phones&#8212;a certain number are playing games, a certain number are checking their email, a certain number are listening to music and looking at something that goes with the music.
