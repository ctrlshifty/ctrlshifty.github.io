     <p>Dear {{ person.first-name }},</p>
     <p>I am both terribly excited and terribly embarrassed to send this email.</p>
  <p>It's been many years since you've last heard from me regarding the CTRL+Shift project, and even longer since our interview, which was on {{person.date-interviewed}}. The delay is the cause of my embarrassment, but I am excited, nevertheless, to let you know that the website for the project is finally up: <a href="https://www.ctrl-shift.org/">https://www.ctrl-shift.org</a>
  </p>
  <p> My hope is that you’ll see that we've done something unique and interesting
      with the interviews I conducted with you and the other poets those many years ago and
      forgive my long delay.
  </p>
  <p>
      I say “we” because I ended up working with two MFA students (now recent graduates) at Idaho on
      this project over the course of the last year and a half. Their names are
      Corey Oglesby and Lauren Westerfield. Both are truly excellent
      poets/writers and human beings, and this would not have been possible
  without their work. (More about them can be found on the <a href="https://www.ctrl-shift.org/about.html">about page</a>.)
  </p>
  <p>
      The actual site uses the interview recordings and transcripts to create a
      variety of access points and interpretations. You will find there are
      several features related to our individual interview across the CTRL +
      Shift site. Here’s a list, with links directly to those pages featuring your interview:
  </p>
           <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.ctrl-shift.org/interviews/transcripts/{{ person.object-id }}.html">Filtered Transcript</a>, browseable based on thematic subjects throughout the interviews, and free-text searchable   </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.ctrl-shift.org//processes/{{ person.object-id }}.html">Index/Transcript + Audio Recording</a>, using a tool called the Oral History Metadata Synchronizer ... 
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.ctrl-shift.org/videos/{{ person.object-id }}.html">Video</a> (if you declined to be recorded, we created a YouTube video with just audio and a photo)</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.ctrl-shift.org/photos/{{ person.object-id }}.html">Photo Gallery</a></li>
            <li>and some additional interpretations/play, including:
                  <ul><li> a <a href="https://www.ctrl-shift.org/flotsam/genpoems/{{ person.object-id }}.html">Poem Generator</a> that randomizes lines taken from the audio transcript translated automatically by YouTube into a “poem”
                  </li>
                  <li>some <a href="https://www.ctrl-shift.org/analyses.html">overarching analyses</a> related to <a href="https://www.ctrl-shift.org/analyses/{{ person.object-id }}.html">common questions/answers</a> and common tools</li>
                  <li> and <a href="https://www.ctrl-shift.org/processes/{{ person.object-id }}.html">process narratives and visualizations</a> that describe and visualize your practice based on information from the interview. 
                  </li>

            I am happy to answer any questions you may have about the site and its
            usage. I am also happy to take anything down or revise any portion of the
            site that you’d like me too (within reason of course ...). I know that seeing
            all this from such a long time ago may be a bit jarring, and I don’t want
            to share anything through the site that makes you uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
            I do apologize for how long it has taken. I can give excuses, and I guess I
            will: I published a book, had two kids (Agnes, 3, and Wallace, 5 months)
            and my job was upgraded and became much more demanding. I
            also have to say that this type of work takes a lot of effort and time,
            which I didn’t fully realize when embarking on the interviews or the
            web project.BUT, I know this is coming out of the blue and and I am sorry for that.
            Hopefully the extent of this work makes up, in some small part, for the
            delay.
        </p>
        <p>
            Corey, Lauren, and I presented the project on campus this next week, and I will be
            giving a brief technical overview of how the site works at a digital
        libraries conference in October. We also hope to write up our    <a href="https://www.ctrl-shift.org/about.html">findings</a> more formally
            in order to include them in a journal of some sort. That said, the site is
            still not indexed by Google, nor easily discoverable any other way, so any
            changes that might be needed can be in effect before any of this is being
            routinely accessed by people other than me and my collaborators.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most importantly, I want to thank you for being a part of this project. You
            took out time from your life and invited me into your home, and for that I
            am really grateful. I learned so much about writing, and the type of hard
            work, intellectual engagement, and dogged perseverance that it takes to
            construct such a productive and impressive career.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also want to mention how much my collaborators learned as graduate
            students from working with/listening to the interviews. The project taught all of
            us a great deal about writing and what it takes to maintain a practice. My
            hope is that others will find the site and enjoy a similar experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            So again, please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. The
            site has only been up now for a day, and corrections are easily made.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yrs,
