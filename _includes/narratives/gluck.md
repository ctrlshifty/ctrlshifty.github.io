Louise Gl端ck does not use a computer. For her, the transition between physical and mechanized drafting is neither linear nor chronological. Earlier in her career, she composed poems on a typewriter--and from there, the shift was not from typewriter to computer, but rather back to longhand drafting (which was also how she composed her first book, Firstborn). When transposing poems from her notebook to the typewriter, Gl端ck revises as she goes--stopping whenever she reaches an impasse or ineffective line, putting a new sheet of paper in the typewriter, and starting over. Other times, when she is experiencing a productive 'brain corner,' she composes directly on the typewriter. Her process, then, varies from project to project.

In terms of revision, Gl端ck seeks out the inherent parallels and connections that emerge within a working collection of poems--those that don't necessarily make themselves readily apparent during the writing process itself. Her driving priority in revising individual poems has evolved from seeking something more honed and perfect to capturing a quotidian, 'human sounding,'voice--a sound akin to daily speech. Gl端ck achieves this sonic revision without reading her poems aloud. Rather, she 'hears with her eyes' and picks up on rhythmic structures in her head.
