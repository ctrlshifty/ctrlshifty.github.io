<h1>What is CTRL+SHIFT?</h1>

<h2>The Short Answer</h2>

CTRL+Shift is an online collection of audio recordings, transcripts, process visualizations, and data analyses broken out from interviews conducted with 11 prominent contemporary American poets from across the United States. The project examines recent changes in writing practices that occurred due to the advent of the computer and the arrival of the digital age and investigates new modes of working with and publishing data from qualitative interview studies. <a href="http://www.devinbecker.org">Devin Becker</a> conducted the interviews in 2013 and 2014 as part of a University of Idaho Seed Grant award. University of Idaho MFA Candidates Corey Oglesby and Lauren Westerfield worked with Becker in the summer of 2017 to analyze and publish the data and findings online at CTRL+Shift.org.

<h2>But what is it really?</h2> 

CTRL+Shift began as something of an ethnographic survey, and ended up a meta-narrative of digital/creative process. 

That’s the jargon-heavy summary. But what does it mean? 

Let’s start with the primary narrative—that is, the initial project. From November 2013 to June 2014, Idaho-based poet and librarian Devin Becker traveled around the country interviewing 11 prominent poets about their writing practices. Throughout these interviews, Becker paid particular attention to shifts in each poet’s physical (i.e. drafting) and creative (i.e. research and inspiration) processes in relation to the dawn of personal computing. 

Most of his subjects—including luminaries like [Louise Gluck](interviews/gluck), [Robert Pinsky](interviews/gluck), and [Rae Armantrout](interviews/armantrout)—began their careers in the analog era. Thus, Becker’s interview transcripts are replete with references to Selectric typewriters, yellow legal pads, thesis binders, reams of butcher paper, and early word processors—all the transitional tools that helped carry his subjects’ work into the age of digital research, version control, and Cloud-based archiving practice. Along the way, he also gleaned insights into the more ineffable, aesthetic aspects of each poet’s work—from [Bruce Beasley’s](interviews/beasley) requisite pre-writing daily walks, to [Stephanie Strickland’s](interviews/strickland) palimpsestic note-taking habits, and so on. 

As a poet and archive-keeper himself, Becker was uniquely positioned to engage with his subjects on the way digital tools (such as Google, email, the Cloud, and basic coding language) have influenced both production and preservation of creative work. And when he returned to the University of Idaho to begin organizing and assessing his results, Becker—together with library staffers and two graduate student interns—likewise began to see how the task of digitally organizing this material might, in fact, become it’s own meta-process narrative. 

A few examples:

Both of Becker’s graduate interns are writers. Both found themselves (in the process of listening to, summarizing, copyediting, and visualizing each poet’s process) borrowing from certain aspects of what Becker terms the “process narrative.” These process adaptations defied genre—or rather, bled easily from poetry to prose, and back again. Poet Corey Oglesby found himself translating Beasley’s pen-and-paper “scrap yard” approach (that is, shuffling isolated words and lines on notecards in order to find a new way into the stanza) into an Excel spreadsheet. Lyric essayist Lauren Westerfield wound up inputting flash prose into textual analysis sites like Voyant Tools to create word clouds, assess thematic repetition, and generate ideas for new work. As for Becker, the challenge of structuring each poet’s process within a digital venue became a repeated exercise in “breaking down to build back up”—that is, fragmenting and re-ordering interview data in the same way someone like Bruce Beasley might cull words and lines from pocket notebooks after a walk, and then sit down to start drafting a poem. 

Ultimately, then, CTRL+Shift is a way of seeing—from various angles—how creative people work. Writers and scholars. Artist and archivists. Whether that angle of vision comes via text or image or digital “flotsam” (working title for digital playgrounds like the Poem Generator insert link) doesn’t matter.
