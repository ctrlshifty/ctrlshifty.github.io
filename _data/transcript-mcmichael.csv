start,end,line
0:00:01.639,0:00:07.31,are you sure let's get some nice shot to

0:00:05.100,0:00:14.51,the dogs get you food

0:00:07.319,0:00:18.77,I should be okay now is your thing on

0:00:14.519,0:00:21.00,here I it's red red that's great

0:00:18.779,0:00:22.59,so I'm just gonna okay I'm going to

0:00:21.000,0:00:23.58,record it as I kind of explain it to you

0:00:22.590,0:00:27.33,then I'm just going to check and make

0:00:23.580,0:00:30.48,sure this sound is right into it so I

0:00:27.330,0:00:32.70,have so the first part is kind of like

0:00:30.480,0:00:34.11,basically how you're working now with

0:00:32.700,0:00:38.85,the computer and stuff like that it's

0:00:34.110,0:00:40.11,based on the on the survey and article

0:00:38.850,0:00:43.14,that Collier and I did about two years

0:00:40.110,0:00:45.96,ago and I'm just looking at that

0:00:43.140,0:00:47.78,practice right now and then we'll go and

0:00:45.960,0:00:49.37,kind of talk about how the writing

0:00:47.789,0:00:51.62,practice has changed in relationship to

0:00:49.379,0:00:53.10,the computer I mean but it doesn't

0:00:51.629,0:00:54.78,always have to be about computer I'm

0:00:53.100,0:01:00.53,really just trying to adapt mark the

0:00:54.780,0:01:03.29,process types and how it's changed so do

0:01:00.539,0:01:07.22,you have any questions I don't think so

0:01:03.290,0:01:11.86,the grant for this

0:01:07.229,0:01:11.86,yeah that's great no yeah

0:01:26.170,0:01:35.95,yeah it's uh I mean I guess I supposed

0:01:31.340,0:01:35.95,to do ten of these you're number three

0:01:38.770,0:01:46.97,so you you have to go these coasts for

0:01:42.950,0:01:49.55,Louise and Robert yeah yeah I'll go

0:01:46.970,0:01:53.57,although there eventually I think I

0:01:49.550,0:01:58.12,think in May that's a good time to go

0:01:53.570,0:01:58.12,instead of March I know right

0:02:28.780,0:02:39.40,okay testing testing Jim you want to say

0:02:34.720,0:02:40.00,where we are and what day it is and who

0:02:39.400,0:02:43.92,you are

0:02:40.000,0:02:48.94,date of birth all that stuff okay

0:02:43.920,0:02:53.06,st. Patrick's Day 2014 we're in Long

0:02:48.940,0:03:07.39,Beach California I was born on July 19th

0:02:53.069,0:03:11.37,1939 and what else was there that this

0:03:07.390,0:03:11.37,is just a stop now

0:03:38.519,0:03:42.90,and so yeah we'll go through these and

0:03:41.069,0:03:44.44,come some of it gets a little repetitive

0:03:42.909,0:03:49.17,it's looking to be a little bit more

0:03:44.440,0:03:52.39,exhaustive and I guess we're gaining but

0:03:49.170,0:03:54.04,please if you just feel like we can

0:03:52.390,0:03:55.54,please cover it or anything or some of

0:03:54.040,0:03:57.37,these seem you know just sake let's go

0:03:55.540,0:04:02.70,you know it's fine

0:03:57.370,0:04:03.48,and if you'll want to let me know if

0:04:02.709,0:04:05.29,you've any questions in the middle

0:04:03.489,0:04:06.45,anything like that it's not doesn't need

0:04:05.290,0:04:08.68,to go straight through we can take

0:04:06.459,0:04:10.90,breaks and whatever it's sort of think

0:04:08.680,0:04:13.03,so so we've gotten kind of where we're

0:04:10.900,0:04:14.59,at I'm going to right I'm going to ask

0:04:13.030,0:04:16.29,you about kind of how you can currently

0:04:14.590,0:04:19.44,compose I'm using the computer how you

0:04:16.299,0:04:21.97,currently save and how you kind of back

0:04:19.449,0:04:23.19,it up and work with the files and and

0:04:21.970,0:04:26.05,then we'll move on to the process

0:04:23.199,0:04:27.78,questions so the first question is in

0:04:26.050,0:04:30.46,these are meant to be kind of short

0:04:27.789,0:04:33.94,answer basically so what genre do you

0:04:30.460,0:04:37.69,working in as a writer only home like

0:04:33.940,0:04:40.78,poetry quick what kind of devices do you

0:04:37.690,0:04:43.47,own or have access to for writing just

0:04:40.780,0:04:45.94,this suspect computer machine and uh

0:04:43.470,0:04:48.31,what operating systems you use them I

0:04:45.940,0:04:54.46,don't know is it a Windows computer I

0:04:48.310,0:04:58.66,think so yeah no it's pretty sure I know

0:04:54.460,0:05:03.09,almost nothing about it okay and you

0:04:58.660,0:05:06.55,work on that device primarily and that's

0:05:03.099,0:05:09.47,where your files are stored as well my

0:05:06.550,0:05:12.58,files are up here to the right um there

0:05:09.479,0:05:18.16,artist sketchbook so they're unlined

0:05:12.580,0:05:22.78,yeah and I I take notes from the reading

0:05:18.160,0:05:28.84,I do in those and also include in green

0:05:22.780,0:05:31.90,ink my own responses to the things I'm

0:05:28.840,0:05:34.09,reading or things that occur to me that

0:05:31.900,0:05:37.90,might turn out to be germs for lines

0:05:34.090,0:05:42.25,okay so so it's you know I I do that

0:05:37.900,0:05:45.03,longhand yeah and do you have then when

0:05:42.250,0:05:45.68,do they transfer those those ideas and

0:05:45.039,0:05:47.93,those working

0:05:45.689,0:05:50.84,onto the computer and when when they are

0:05:47.939,0:05:53.12,saved just on that computer in a

0:05:50.849,0:05:56.42,selective way okay then I'll go into

0:05:53.129,0:06:03.44,these notebooks and and take stuff from

0:05:56.429,0:06:07.13,them and then in that form develop some

0:06:03.449,0:06:15.38,of what's there add to it

0:06:07.139,0:06:17.54,so that's part of the process too so and

0:06:15.389,0:06:20.66,then so I guess I guess just in terms of

0:06:17.549,0:06:22.70,your computer files how do you have them

0:06:20.669,0:06:24.38,like in a certain folder do you save

0:06:22.709,0:06:26.69,them in certain kind of organizational

0:06:24.389,0:06:28.25,fashion or they just once you transfer

0:06:26.699,0:06:30.14,them they're either there and you don't

0:06:28.259,0:06:33.58,worry about them they're there and I can

0:06:30.149,0:06:37.11,find them alphabetically okay okay

0:06:33.589,0:06:39.32,and then when you work I mean so what

0:06:37.110,0:06:42.71,are these are these files doing

0:06:39.329,0:06:45.62,primarily for your for publishing sake

0:06:42.719,0:06:49.19,or I mean likes you only for composition

0:06:45.629,0:06:50.78,oh no no competition right do you print

0:06:49.199,0:06:55.28,them out and revise them from the

0:06:50.789,0:06:56.72,computer sometimes sometimes and what

0:06:55.289,0:07:02.59,are your naming conventions for those

0:06:56.729,0:07:02.59,files usually the date the date stamp

0:07:03.110,0:07:07.52,I'm sorry the date and the notebook so

0:07:05.729,0:07:09.83,the notebooks are numbered so it'll be

0:07:07.529,0:07:12.59,from notebook 23 or something like that

0:07:09.839,0:07:14.81,great so the bit still will be that in

0:07:12.599,0:07:16.64,addition to the date and if you went and

0:07:14.819,0:07:19.16,revised one of the computer files would

0:07:16.649,0:07:21.44,you make a new file or would you just

0:07:19.169,0:07:23.09,like right over what's already there

0:07:21.449,0:07:24.89,I'd right over what's there and then it

0:07:23.099,0:07:29.09,would get probably a different number of

0:07:24.899,0:07:31.19,you know document number okay so it

0:07:29.099,0:07:33.02,would be like as my angel example here

0:07:31.199,0:07:37.12,is like the wasteland dot one and then

0:07:33.029,0:07:39.76,do I plan to damage that kind of okay

0:07:37.129,0:07:43.86,sure TS Eliot would have loved computers

0:07:39.769,0:07:45.68,and then do you back up those files or

0:07:43.860,0:07:47.15,do you just keep them on that computer

0:07:45.689,0:07:49.43,do you have you put them on like a

0:07:47.159,0:07:52.25,Dropbox or anything like that or is it

0:07:49.439,0:07:55.01,just on that computer on Wednesday I'm

0:07:52.259,0:07:58.37,told by our tech that what's there gets

0:07:55.019,0:07:59.55,backed up okay so you know Wednesday at

0:07:58.379,0:08:01.20,2 a.m. or some

0:07:59.550,0:08:05.67,like that or no Thursday at 2:00 a.m.

0:08:01.200,0:08:07.74,okay some backup takes place and yeah so

0:08:05.670,0:08:09.27,that's all I know about it you have you

0:08:07.740,0:08:11.16,don't have like an external hard drive

0:08:09.270,0:08:14.19,or something some other box in which you

0:08:11.160,0:08:16.47,put them there's just this blue thing

0:08:14.190,0:08:22.76,down there or whatever that is oh yeah

0:08:16.470,0:08:22.76,yeah that's good yeah that's it okay and

0:08:23.240,0:08:28.77,what do you do like when when you get to

0:08:26.790,0:08:30.75,like a final draft or something what

0:08:28.770,0:08:34.65,what is is there another protocol for

0:08:30.750,0:08:37.95,that sort of file or that file would

0:08:34.650,0:08:40.35,have the title of the poem and and then

0:08:37.950,0:08:42.81,that would be you know the highest

0:08:40.350,0:08:44.70,number of the draft of that poem would

0:08:42.810,0:08:48.17,be the the most current one the one

0:08:44.700,0:08:51.39,that's okay replace the others yeah yeah

0:08:48.170,0:08:53.13,and your tech who is what's the

0:08:51.390,0:08:57.15,relationship between you and your tester

0:08:53.130,0:09:00.81,he's some a genius

0:08:57.150,0:09:03.84,he's an expensive genius his name's

0:09:00.810,0:09:06.66,Steve Maron off we're entirely dependent

0:09:03.840,0:09:08.85,on him Susan and I for having these

0:09:06.660,0:09:12.18,machines continuing to work and he's

0:09:08.850,0:09:13.80,never failed good good and he cut and he

0:09:12.180,0:09:15.90,you guys like consult with him like when

0:09:13.800,0:09:18.42,you get a new machine or how does how

0:09:15.900,0:09:19.86,does that relationship work if if that

0:09:18.420,0:09:23.39,happens or if something goes wrong with

0:09:19.860,0:09:26.94,one of these but I'd say we see him

0:09:23.390,0:09:28.29,maybe three or four times a year okay he

0:09:26.940,0:09:30.24,just checks to make everything at make

0:09:28.290,0:09:32.61,sure everything's working and backing up

0:09:30.240,0:09:34.74,and right we call him if we have a

0:09:32.610,0:09:36.69,problem and then we usually see him

0:09:34.740,0:09:39.72,within a couple of days he's he's

0:09:36.690,0:09:45.90,wonderfully reliable how long has that

0:09:39.720,0:09:48.48,relationship been going on I think like

0:09:45.900,0:09:50.61,eight years maybe something like that he

0:09:48.480,0:09:54.54,had worked for another company and then

0:09:50.610,0:09:57.21,and now he's on his own yeah don't

0:09:54.540,0:10:00.33,consulting yeah great

0:09:57.210,0:10:01.24,and did you seek him out or did you know

0:10:00.330,0:10:04.95,him we mean

0:10:01.240,0:10:06.58,Susan had him come out when he was

0:10:04.959,0:10:08.74,working for the company that he worked

0:10:06.580,0:10:10.66,for before he at his own business okay

0:10:08.740,0:10:16.24,and liked him a lot

0:10:10.660,0:10:18.31,and grateful he's confidence-inspiring

0:10:16.240,0:10:23.45,you know I mean we really count on him

0:10:18.310,0:10:23.45,and that's very grateful to me yeah yeah

0:10:25.740,0:10:30.45,okay so that's the basic kind of like

0:10:28.540,0:10:32.83,just kind of get a sense of where you're

0:10:30.459,0:10:35.92,at with your digital composition and now

0:10:32.830,0:10:38.08,we'll talk more about the process and

0:10:35.920,0:10:41.17,the writing in the notebooks and the

0:10:38.080,0:10:42.76,arts books and stuff like that so and

0:10:41.170,0:10:44.44,then to start I'd like to kind of know

0:10:42.760,0:10:46.30,like how long would you say you've been

0:10:44.440,0:10:48.52,writing professionally I mean in

0:10:46.300,0:10:51.16,innocence that it's that writing has

0:10:48.520,0:10:53.32,been what's kind of supported you in

0:10:51.160,0:10:55.39,some way I know the teaching but I think

0:10:53.320,0:10:58.87,that's kind of intertwined I published

0:10:55.390,0:11:02.89,my first poem fifty three years ago okay

0:10:58.870,0:11:04.99,so and could you give us kind of an

0:11:02.890,0:11:07.81,overview of like the arc of your career

0:11:04.990,0:11:12.04,starting with maybe like education and

0:11:07.810,0:11:14.70,then moving through I was an

0:11:12.040,0:11:20.04,undergraduate at UC Santa Barbara and

0:11:14.700,0:11:22.95,had some extraordinary teachers there

0:11:20.040,0:11:25.14,learned how to read didn't learn how to

0:11:22.959,0:11:28.72,write that I learned how to read I think

0:11:25.149,0:11:31.39,from them and then I did did my graduate

0:11:28.720,0:11:35.55,work got a PhD at Stanford immediately

0:11:31.390,0:11:35.55,after I graduated from Santa Barbara and

0:11:36.180,0:11:43.39,was through with the PhD in 1965 at a

0:11:40.390,0:11:47.70,time when white males got jobs in the

0:11:43.390,0:11:52.45,Academy okay and and so I took the job

0:11:47.709,0:11:58.06,at Irvine and and began teaching in the

0:11:52.450,0:12:02.07,fall of 65 there and understood at that

0:11:58.060,0:12:07.77,time that I had six years to complete a

0:12:02.079,0:12:11.98,book that would get me tenure and at

0:12:07.779,0:12:14.50,that time there weren't poets getting

0:12:11.980,0:12:17.65,tenure by writing books at Palm

0:12:14.500,0:12:24.79,yeah so it seemed as if what I needed to

0:12:17.650,0:12:27.91,do was continue the critical expository

0:12:24.790,0:12:32.13,writing that I'd done as a PhD student

0:12:27.910,0:12:32.13,in English and American literature I

0:12:33.480,0:12:40.93,wrote and published four essays out of

0:12:36.490,0:12:43.54,my dissertation they weren't exactly a

0:12:40.930,0:12:48.31,book I could have turned them into a

0:12:43.540,0:12:51.91,book but after about two years in the

0:12:48.310,0:12:56.26,job I started writing quite bad poems

0:12:51.910,0:13:00.49,and they continued to be bad poems until

0:12:56.260,0:13:02.83,I completed a book of them and I

0:13:00.490,0:13:09.31,submitted it for publication it was

0:13:02.830,0:13:12.10,accepted it turned up in the mail i sat

0:13:09.310,0:13:14.23,down and read it and it confirmed what I

0:13:12.100,0:13:16.93,knew about it which was that it was a

0:13:14.230,0:13:19.42,really bad book of poems because this

0:13:16.930,0:13:25.75,this was in 1971 that the book turned

0:13:19.420,0:13:27.79,out but it got me tenure and and this is

0:13:25.750,0:13:33.70,again stefani I guess following evil

0:13:27.790,0:13:39.43,yeah and it had the vegetables in it and

0:13:33.700,0:13:42.28,add it and that that was that was

0:13:39.430,0:13:45.96,important to me in the sense that it

0:13:42.280,0:13:49.80,gave me a standard that I wanted to to

0:13:45.960,0:13:55.36,live up to and anything else I kept yeah

0:13:49.800,0:14:00.57,after that and so then you know I had

0:13:55.360,0:14:00.57,the great good fortune of being able to

0:14:00.630,0:14:07.24,have it take as long as it needed for me

0:14:03.670,0:14:12.07,to write another book I wrote the second

0:14:07.240,0:14:15.52,book which I still like and and then

0:14:12.070,0:14:17.98,I've gone from there with an in with a

0:14:15.520,0:14:20.77,kind of interruption in in the writing

0:14:17.980,0:14:24.72,of poetry I I finished for good things

0:14:20.770,0:14:31.50,in the late 70s it was published in 9,
0:14:24.720,0:14:38.04,eighty and and then I then I wrote a

0:14:31.500,0:14:40.17,book on Ulysses and and I needed I

0:14:38.040,0:14:41.81,needed to teach myself how to write a

0:14:40.170,0:14:43.35,paragraph I didn't know how to write a

0:14:41.819,0:14:47.79,paragraph I knew how to write a

0:14:43.350,0:14:50.69,paragraph and in graduate school prose

0:14:47.790,0:14:52.88,but yeah but not a paragraph those are

0:14:50.699,0:14:56.73,different things and so so that took

0:14:52.889,0:14:58.07,that took quite a while I didn't

0:14:56.730,0:14:59.93,understand that that's what I was doing

0:14:58.079,0:15:01.91,at the time I didn't understand that I

0:14:59.939,0:15:05.63,didn't know what a paragraph was but

0:15:01.910,0:15:07.82,because I I was meaning to be dealing

0:15:05.639,0:15:11.37,with the content of what it was I was

0:15:07.829,0:15:14.61,wanting to write about but it took it

0:15:11.370,0:15:18.12,took about four years just to to get

0:15:14.610,0:15:20.93,that formal understanding in place about

0:15:18.120,0:15:24.72,how out of how to write a chapter of

0:15:20.939,0:15:28.25,paragraphs yeah and so I worked on the I

0:15:24.720,0:15:31.00,worked on the Ulysses book not

0:15:28.259,0:15:34.50,interrupted Lee for about ten years and

0:15:31.009,0:15:38.25,and then didn't go back to writing poems

0:15:34.500,0:15:42.44,until it was finished and so I finished

0:15:38.250,0:15:44.12,it I finished it about 1990 yes and then

0:15:42.449,0:15:47.00,I've been working on poems ever since

0:15:44.129,0:15:50.37,then and you it sends you then you

0:15:47.009,0:15:52.80,publish three books I published each in

0:15:50.370,0:15:55.37,a place a part of the world at large

0:15:52.800,0:15:59.50,which is new and selected and there was

0:15:55.379,0:16:02.97,you know it's only it's only about a

0:15:59.509,0:16:05.79,tenth of the of that book is new yeah

0:16:02.970,0:16:08.18,and then capacity which was published in

0:16:05.790,0:16:10.92,2006 and I've just completed another

0:16:08.189,0:16:13.82,book called if you can tell if you can

0:16:10.920,0:16:16.80,tell and that when do you you know in

0:16:13.829,0:16:18.20,that's I'm guessing I'm guessing it'll

0:16:16.800,0:16:20.54,be within the next two years

0:16:18.209,0:16:20.54,great

0:16:23.509,0:16:31.36,that's good um so generally I'm kind of

0:16:29.059,0:16:33.73,broken these questions into three stages

0:16:31.369,0:16:36.37,of the writing process the compositional

0:16:33.739,0:16:40.16,stage the stage of revision and the

0:16:36.379,0:16:43.00,organizational / archival stage that is

0:16:40.160,0:16:44.62,my own kind of box for these things if

0:16:43.009,0:16:46.93,you think those do not fit your own

0:16:44.629,0:16:47.89,personal writing style and we can we can

0:16:46.939,0:16:50.89,kind of go through these in different

0:16:47.899,0:16:52.57,ways but if that sounds okay then we can

0:16:50.899,0:16:53.98,start and put it any time it's just like

0:16:52.579,0:16:55.91,well this doesn't make as much sense and

0:16:53.989,0:16:57.41,you can go back and revise this and

0:16:55.910,0:16:58.75,because we talked about one thing in one

0:16:57.410,0:17:00.58,section doesn't mean we'd talk about the

0:16:58.759,0:17:03.64,only thing well I understand the first

0:17:00.589,0:17:06.86,two of those they seem perfectly clear

0:17:03.649,0:17:10.41,but what would the archival um I would

0:17:06.860,0:17:13.88,say that would be once you've revised

0:17:10.419,0:17:16.66,poems in two or four critical writing

0:17:13.880,0:17:18.40,although private focus were poems into

0:17:16.669,0:17:21.86,more of a final state how do you deal

0:17:18.409,0:17:25.06,with organizing a collection how do you

0:17:21.860,0:17:26.83,deal with in the the more my new show of

0:17:25.069,0:17:28.97,saving them making sure they're you know

0:17:26.839,0:17:30.91,together and sending them off I mean

0:17:28.970,0:17:33.40,kind of that's kind of it all right yeah

0:17:30.919,0:17:36.88,more the business and I guess I asked

0:17:33.409,0:17:39.11,because that is that's going on all the

0:17:36.889,0:17:41.69,time in in what I think of is the first

0:17:39.110,0:17:43.51,two stages okay okay and that's okay so

0:17:41.690,0:17:45.35,maybe we'll just we'll just address them

0:17:43.519,0:17:51.08,okay in the first two stages now in it

0:17:45.350,0:17:52.39,it's not that maybe I'd like a couple

0:17:51.080,0:17:55.13,questions for my section but there won't

0:17:52.399,0:17:57.44,be much it's I mean I this may just be

0:17:55.130,0:18:01.34,parenthetical but but for me since I

0:17:57.440,0:18:03.62,tend to work and extended what can seem

0:18:01.340,0:18:06.62,like book links forms almost all the

0:18:03.620,0:18:11.05,time then any individual poem I'm

0:18:06.620,0:18:12.83,working on has has a necessary

0:18:11.059,0:18:15.50,relationship to everything else I'm

0:18:12.830,0:18:17.89,imagining it's being with and so that's

0:18:15.500,0:18:21.20,part of why what what you're describing

0:18:17.899,0:18:25.25,is archival would have to be kind of in

0:18:21.200,0:18:27.35,front of me all the time right so I

0:18:25.250,0:18:31.48,thought that maybe part of why it seems

0:18:27.350,0:18:31.48,to me that it's it that make sense

0:18:36.600,0:18:43.84,good shot my neck so okay so let's start

0:18:42.550,0:18:45.73,with by talking about kind of a

0:18:43.840,0:18:48.04,compositional to the writing prewriting

0:18:45.730,0:18:49.93,the generative parts and I know that

0:18:48.040,0:18:53.98,reading hasn't punched up quite a lot to

0:18:49.930,0:18:56.89,Dupre him so I'd like to start when you

0:18:53.980,0:18:59.32,when you first started writing and I

0:18:56.890,0:19:01.06,guess a part of this will be kind of

0:18:59.320,0:19:02.83,tracking like the changes in your

0:19:01.060,0:19:04.69,process so like if there were certain

0:19:02.830,0:19:07.15,ways you work at the beginning like did

0:19:04.690,0:19:08.65,those change they change again so when

0:19:07.150,0:19:10.36,you first started writing would you kind

0:19:08.650,0:19:14.44,of describe your typical compositional

0:19:10.360,0:19:15.76,prewriting drafting practices and yeah

0:19:14.440,0:19:20.65,so when you first started in women was

0:19:15.760,0:19:23.44,wouldn't live this period be um I guess

0:19:20.650,0:19:27.58,I guess the early 1960s when I was still

0:19:23.440,0:19:30.19,an undergraduate I was writing I mean if

0:19:27.580,0:19:32.89,the poems that I wrote before 1970 were

0:19:30.190,0:19:37.33,bad those phones were awful so they were

0:19:32.890,0:19:41.02,they were worse and and there weren't

0:19:37.330,0:19:43.95,many of them soon after I'd started

0:19:41.020,0:19:47.89,writing poems I was in a ph.d program

0:19:43.950,0:19:50.47,and even though I had a Stegner

0:19:47.890,0:19:55.33,fellowship for one of the years that I

0:19:50.470,0:19:59.62,was there which entailed taking writing

0:19:55.330,0:20:01.39,workshops both the workshop wasn't

0:19:59.620,0:20:05.47,anything like the workshops that you and

0:20:01.390,0:20:08.14,I know yeah and in the sense that not

0:20:05.470,0:20:12.91,much went on in them there were maybe

0:20:08.140,0:20:17.38,four people in the room and not much God

0:20:12.910,0:20:21.01,said about them and and it was a it was

0:20:17.380,0:20:24.43,a very minor part of the four years that

0:20:21.010,0:20:27.91,I spent getting a PhD so the bulk of

0:20:24.430,0:20:30.97,that work was was reading and and

0:20:27.910,0:20:34.77,writing essays and having conversations

0:20:30.970,0:20:37.70,with my with my wonderful peers very so

0:20:34.770,0:20:42.04,so

0:20:37.700,0:20:46.21,I didn't have any reliable habits as a

0:20:42.049,0:20:50.15,writer of poems I don't think until

0:20:46.210,0:20:53.48,until I was maybe two years into the job

0:20:50.150,0:20:58.82,at Irvine so let's say 1967 or something

0:20:53.480,0:21:06.32,like that and and then whatever it was I

0:20:58.820,0:21:08.92,was doing wasn't working yeah and and I

0:21:06.320,0:21:11.66,think it wasn't working because what I

0:21:08.929,0:21:14.57,was needing to do was convince myself

0:21:11.660,0:21:21.61,that I knew how to write a poem yeah so

0:21:14.570,0:21:21.61,the the substance of the work was

0:21:21.700,0:21:29.92,completely inverted in terms of its

0:21:24.799,0:21:31.42,being a working out of my need to prove

0:21:29.929,0:21:36.26,something to myself that I couldn't

0:21:31.429,0:21:38.80,prove yeah I couldn't prove it because

0:21:36.260,0:21:40.66,what I was proving to myself was that I

0:21:38.809,0:21:43.40,didn't know how to write a good poem and

0:21:40.660,0:21:49.05,and that went on for three or four years

0:21:43.400,0:21:49.05,and and I think it didn't it didn't it

0:21:52.030,0:21:59.54,wasn't anything I could alter until

0:21:56.230,0:22:03.28,until I asked myself if there was

0:21:59.540,0:22:07.64,something I needed to write about yet

0:22:03.280,0:22:09.35,rather than just my own insecurity as

0:22:07.640,0:22:14.84,someone who didn't know how to write a

0:22:09.350,0:22:17.00,poem yeah and then so in those I guess

0:22:14.840,0:22:18.20,in after you wrote that or sort of

0:22:17.000,0:22:19.46,started asking yourself that question

0:22:18.200,0:22:21.88,and you started to write the poem

0:22:19.460,0:22:24.59,because you consider your poems

0:22:21.880,0:22:26.60,did you mean in terms of the sort of

0:22:24.590,0:22:28.97,minutiae of your writing style of your

0:22:26.600,0:22:32.54,writing process what did that start a

0:22:28.970,0:22:34.25,certain that with that market shift or

0:22:32.540,0:22:36.14,was there always a sort of way that you

0:22:34.250,0:22:39.20,approach the writing and that just kind

0:22:36.140,0:22:43.22,of gradually expanded or there had to

0:22:39.200,0:22:46.30,have been the shift that since before

0:22:43.220,0:22:48.97,writing the vegetables which was which

0:22:46.309,0:22:48.97,is a poem about

0:22:49.909,0:22:56.36,the impact on me of my mother's death

0:22:53.659,0:23:02.29,when I was 11 years old

0:22:56.360,0:23:07.94,prior to having that as as matter to

0:23:02.299,0:23:10.99,write about I I wouldn't I wouldn't have

0:23:07.940,0:23:14.05,been able to identify a phrase that I

0:23:10.999,0:23:16.00,came up with that that was good enough

0:23:14.059,0:23:20.45,there's no other way to say it

0:23:16.009,0:23:26.57,yeah we've good enough to keep I'd come

0:23:20.450,0:23:30.95,up with phrases and I I didn't have the

0:23:26.570,0:23:36.49,acumen to be able to tell that this

0:23:30.950,0:23:39.30,phrase was better was enough better than

0:23:36.499,0:23:43.85,the accompanying phrases that it could

0:23:39.309,0:23:46.39,supply me with an example of what I had

0:23:43.850,0:23:50.02,to bring everything else up to yeah and

0:23:46.399,0:23:52.54,so I was just putting stuff together and

0:23:50.029,0:23:56.14,there it was and it wasn't it wasn't any

0:23:52.549,0:24:02.84,good after I wrote the vegetables I had

0:23:56.149,0:24:06.88,I had a standard that that had to apply

0:24:02.840,0:24:09.04,all the time and and once it was in

0:24:06.889,0:24:13.12,place then I had something to work with

0:24:09.049,0:24:15.49,besides form right I had form too but

0:24:13.129,0:24:18.91,I'd had formed before when I was filling

0:24:15.499,0:24:23.38,for him with bad phrases yeah and and so

0:24:18.919,0:24:26.11,then I felt more equipped to know what

0:24:23.389,0:24:28.66,to keep and what not to keep so how are

0:24:26.119,0:24:30.61,you been able to generate those phrases

0:24:28.669,0:24:32.05,I mean like just how are you able to

0:24:30.619,0:24:35.26,generate the phrase that then you could

0:24:32.059,0:24:37.70,judge as being up to snuff or not I I

0:24:35.269,0:24:40.46,guess by way and this is this is where

0:24:37.700,0:24:43.99,what I said earlier about working in

0:24:40.460,0:24:47.14,extended forms the only way I could the

0:24:43.999,0:24:50.48,only way I knew how to generate it was

0:24:47.149,0:24:55.34,to think really in book-length terms

0:24:50.480,0:24:57.59,okay and and so I'd have you know in the

0:24:55.340,0:25:01.63,case of my second book the lovers

0:24:57.590,0:25:04.12,familiar I I came up with

0:25:01.630,0:25:11.08,something that's also formal but also

0:25:04.120,0:25:16.66,structural the canonical hours so so I

0:25:11.080,0:25:21.48,thought there eight of those midnight

0:25:16.660,0:25:25.00,three am six all the way on to 9:00 p.m.

0:25:21.480,0:25:32.16,if they would organize the book as a

0:25:25.000,0:25:36.45,whole and have a medieval aspect to them

0:25:32.160,0:25:41.10,faintly Catholic if if that was in place

0:25:36.450,0:25:46.98,but it was not really a religious book

0:25:41.100,0:25:49.03,how my how my things go and and then

0:25:46.980,0:25:51.13,there were going to be more than eight

0:25:49.030,0:25:57.40,poems in the book that turned out to be

0:25:51.130,0:26:05.86,15 what what would come in where in

0:25:57.400,0:26:08.44,relation to a 24-hour period what what

0:26:05.860,0:26:15.76,might happen between noon and 3 p.m.

0:26:08.440,0:26:18.61,yeah and and so I had I had that that

0:26:15.760,0:26:22.60,general scheme as something that could

0:26:18.610,0:26:25.51,direct me toward in one case a portrait

0:26:22.600,0:26:28.33,of an otter you know something something

0:26:25.510,0:26:31.45,along those lines and yeah and and then

0:26:28.330,0:26:33.10,a lot of stuff and in in the course of

0:26:31.450,0:26:35.02,work on the book which I'm trying to

0:26:33.100,0:26:38.86,remember how long I think it took me

0:26:35.020,0:26:42.48,like four years to write it you know a

0:26:38.860,0:26:46.29,lot of stuff just fell away because it

0:26:42.480,0:26:50.47,again wasn't good enough yeah and then

0:26:46.290,0:26:52.72,in terms of simply like were you

0:26:50.470,0:26:54.55,drafting by hand by hand all over by

0:26:52.720,0:26:57.67,hand all did my hand then and then I

0:26:54.550,0:27:00.78,would the process through all of the

0:26:57.670,0:27:07.08,books until this most recent one was all

0:27:00.780,0:27:13.30,longhand and then and then typewriter

0:27:07.080,0:27:14.43,and and I loved I loved typing

0:27:13.300,0:27:16.92,successive dress

0:27:14.430,0:27:19.41,because typing is so much easier than

0:27:16.920,0:27:22.38,composing yeah so it was a break you

0:27:19.410,0:27:26.19,know it was so boring this happened so I

0:27:22.380,0:27:29.34,never minded typing yeah and I suspected

0:27:26.190,0:27:31.44,that that I would miss it on this

0:27:29.340,0:27:33.69,machine yeah I didn't miss it

0:27:31.440,0:27:36.06,it turned out that since I'm typing all

0:27:33.690,0:27:38.76,the time I'm composing from the

0:27:36.060,0:27:43.95,beginning and I'm redoing everything and

0:27:38.760,0:27:47.34,it's it's I I liked this I liked and I

0:27:43.950,0:27:52.11,can't imagine that how it was possible

0:27:47.340,0:27:55.14,to write a book of prose to write to

0:27:52.110,0:27:57.90,Ulysses book write longhand with a

0:27:55.140,0:28:00.51,typewriter I mean I just can't it would

0:27:57.900,0:28:05.04,have been so much easier if I'd had if

0:28:00.510,0:28:05.58,I'd had some facility with the computer

0:28:05.040,0:28:10.38,yeah

0:28:05.580,0:28:13.20,to write that yeah and so I guess so you

0:28:10.380,0:28:14.73,said so essentially though all of your

0:28:13.200,0:28:17.46,books except this last one haven't

0:28:14.730,0:28:20.07,followed the similar process and could

0:28:17.460,0:28:27.00,you kind detail that like in the kind of

0:28:20.070,0:28:31.16,like step by step process um I I on a

0:28:27.000,0:28:36.36,good day I mean I have to work every day

0:28:31.160,0:28:40.26,usually in the morning sometimes as

0:28:36.360,0:28:42.15,early as 4:00 I didn't mean to get up at

0:28:40.260,0:28:46.08,that time but I was awake at that time

0:28:42.150,0:28:51.51,and and I was wide awake at that time

0:28:46.080,0:28:56.49,and I go to work right away and and I'd

0:28:51.510,0:29:02.64,go back over what I had to that point in

0:28:56.490,0:29:05.28,a poem and and I'd find stuff that had

0:29:02.640,0:29:08.58,to be revised and so I'd do the revision

0:29:05.280,0:29:11.58,and and sometimes that would be all I

0:29:08.580,0:29:15.06,would do on a given day and then

0:29:11.580,0:29:21.15,something something that I hadn't yet

0:29:15.060,0:29:23.64,gotten to would suggest itself

0:29:21.150,0:29:27.84,and I'd have a phrase or a sentence and

0:29:23.640,0:29:30.66,and and and that that's what I that's

0:29:27.840,0:29:35.04,that that's what I mean when I use the

0:29:30.660,0:29:37.62,word compose is that something I hadn't

0:29:35.040,0:29:40.80,had yet there's at least the possibility

0:29:37.620,0:29:42.84,that I might have and it would sound may

0:29:40.800,0:29:48.36,be something like this maybe one or more

0:29:42.840,0:29:53.07,of the words would yet actually survive

0:29:48.360,0:29:57.39,and so then I nudged it along a little

0:29:53.070,0:30:00.48,more and and on a good day if I had a

0:29:57.390,0:30:02.67,line and a half or two lines how could

0:30:00.480,0:30:05.61,that would be a pretty good day and that

0:30:02.670,0:30:08.58,could take that could take four hours

0:30:05.610,0:30:11.97,and in doing that in kind of getting to

0:30:08.580,0:30:14.94,that point is that all done on on

0:30:11.970,0:30:17.61,notebook paper on longhand yeah what did

0:30:14.940,0:30:20.04,I work I think I just worked by 8 by 1,
0:30:17.610,0:30:21.51,sheets of paper I'm ever at one point

0:30:20.040,0:30:24.24,they were yellow and then they were

0:30:21.510,0:30:26.88,white you know it didn't matter

0:30:24.240,0:30:30.69,yeah and so like what would one of those

0:30:26.880,0:30:35.46,pieces of paper look like a lot of

0:30:30.690,0:30:40.95,crossing out rehearsing what I had

0:30:35.460,0:30:45.54,already that that needed to be there to

0:30:40.950,0:30:50.85,remind me of what what seemed as if it

0:30:45.540,0:30:52.59,had made the cut with me yeah as

0:30:50.850,0:30:55.89,something that could be kept

0:30:52.590,0:30:58.14,okay and then and then some you know

0:30:55.890,0:30:59.97,something new would join it for a while

0:30:58.140,0:31:02.01,but it wouldn't really be good enough

0:30:59.970,0:31:03.99,and then it would have to be revised and

0:31:02.010,0:31:07.77,then pretty soon it would it would be

0:31:03.990,0:31:10.38,better enough maybe to stay and then

0:31:07.770,0:31:14.40,when I'd get I don't know what eight or

0:31:10.380,0:31:18.92,nine lines more than I'd go to I'd go to

0:31:14.400,0:31:24.92,the to the typed copy of what I'd of

0:31:18.929,0:31:29.91,what I'd transcribed from longhand onto

0:31:24.929,0:31:32.48,onto typed copy and add what was new

0:31:29.910,0:31:37.74,and make what changes I had made in

0:31:32.480,0:31:41.94,longhand and and then just bring all

0:31:37.740,0:31:46.26,about along with me and and when I was

0:31:41.940,0:31:51.68,when I was writing my third book for

0:31:46.260,0:31:51.68,good things then that that entailed

0:31:53.120,0:31:59.67,thousands of lines in in untitled

0:31:57.360,0:32:03.33,sections there are sixteen sections of

0:31:59.670,0:32:05.61,it of varying lengths and I'd do it

0:32:03.330,0:32:08.94,section by section and it was pretty

0:32:05.610,0:32:12.42,much chronological but some of the

0:32:08.940,0:32:15.36,sections were I don't know 16 17 pages

0:32:12.420,0:32:18.06,long and so I'd go through the whole

0:32:15.360,0:32:20.94,process for that particular section you

0:32:18.060,0:32:23.43,know if I were typing up what I recently

0:32:20.940,0:32:26.13,added four or five lines to I'd probably

0:32:23.430,0:32:29.00,type the whole thing again okay so you

0:32:26.130,0:32:31.20,were we were generating lines long and

0:32:29.000,0:32:32.43,working on those and then as they got to

0:32:31.200,0:32:34.08,the level where you thought they could

0:32:32.430,0:32:39.11,enter into the poem you would then

0:32:34.080,0:32:42.96,retype this the entire poem or section

0:32:39.110,0:32:47.04,and never minded that activity yeah

0:32:42.960,0:32:49.77,never minded it yes did you find that in

0:32:47.040,0:32:53.76,typing that were you actively making

0:32:49.770,0:32:57.59,changes at that time for no not so much

0:32:53.760,0:33:00.81,not so much and then once you had that

0:32:57.590,0:33:02.79,object would you go back and read it to

0:33:00.810,0:33:04.47,yourself and read it out loud yeah and

0:33:02.790,0:33:07.22,then at that and then you would start

0:33:04.470,0:33:09.84,the revision process on that typewritten

0:33:07.220,0:33:13.67,document probably I'd wait till the next

0:33:09.840,0:33:16.89,day okay you know and it would it would

0:33:13.670,0:33:25.80,more often than not not look so good the

0:33:16.890,0:33:27.72,next day and then so would you save

0:33:25.800,0:33:31.62,these sheets of paper on which you were

0:33:27.720,0:33:34.35,longhand composing not with any fondness

0:33:31.620,0:33:36.93,okay you know I mean they were only they

0:33:34.350,0:33:37.97,were only for my uses it was not

0:33:36.930,0:33:40.40,anything I

0:33:37.970,0:33:42.80,preserve in any way I didn't care about

0:33:40.400,0:33:45.14,anything other than finishing the poem

0:33:42.800,0:33:47.21,and having it done and that was great

0:33:45.140,0:33:52.28,that was all that mattered to me okay

0:33:47.210,0:33:56.27,and I didn't I I didn't often find

0:33:52.280,0:34:00.71,myself in situations in which lines that

0:33:56.270,0:34:03.56,I deleted I later missed and and wished

0:34:00.710,0:34:05.24,I had copies of them to see if I could I

0:34:03.560,0:34:07.64,mean that happened a few times but it

0:34:05.240,0:34:15.68,was it was so rare that I don't think it

0:34:07.640,0:34:20.72,influenced my my ways of going at the

0:34:15.680,0:34:23.45,whole process I I didn't I didn't ever

0:34:20.720,0:34:26.09,regret you know throwing stuff away

0:34:23.450,0:34:30.71,right

0:34:26.090,0:34:32.81,and then so you can kind of maybe talked

0:34:30.710,0:34:34.42,in about how we were already talking

0:34:32.810,0:34:40.07,about the revision process for these

0:34:34.420,0:34:42.41,homes and it seems like I sort of asked

0:34:40.070,0:34:44.03,the other writers like what your sort of

0:34:42.410,0:34:45.71,primary mode of revision or textual

0:34:44.030,0:34:47.03,changes and it seems it's sort of

0:34:45.710,0:34:48.92,subtractive like you would find

0:34:47.030,0:34:50.42,something that you didn't like and then

0:34:48.920,0:34:53.99,would you try to substitute something in

0:34:50.420,0:34:57.92,for that if I could find it fine and if

0:34:53.990,0:35:00.62,I couldn't then it probably needed you

0:34:57.920,0:35:02.60,know to disappear just that part or just

0:35:00.620,0:35:05.21,that part I'll check that part okay but

0:35:02.600,0:35:08.38,you once you kind of had a structure of

0:35:05.210,0:35:11.03,a general poem though it usually stayed

0:35:08.380,0:35:14.57,by the time I got to the end of it it

0:35:11.030,0:35:18.02,did I mean it's all it my I work on them

0:35:14.570,0:35:20.57,always only cumulatively so that so that

0:35:18.020,0:35:23.69,I take them a long line by line I don't

0:35:20.570,0:35:27.08,I don't I'm not able to write a draft of

0:35:23.690,0:35:29.75,something the only the only variation on

0:35:27.080,0:35:32.27,that is that is that I'll sometimes get

0:35:29.750,0:35:35.80,the ending you know it'll it'll present

0:35:32.270,0:35:39.43,itself to me I mean the phrases and

0:35:35.800,0:35:41.77,and and I'll have that as a kind of

0:35:39.430,0:35:45.10,Tilos for where I'm headed

0:35:41.770,0:35:49.54,not all the time but but I'd say half

0:35:45.100,0:35:53.86,the time that happens some somewhat in

0:35:49.540,0:35:55.81,advance of my getting you know even

0:35:53.860,0:35:59.02,within a couple of pages of the ending

0:35:55.810,0:36:04.08,itself it'll it'll occur to me and it

0:35:59.020,0:36:07.66,won't it won't tell me what is missing

0:36:04.080,0:36:11.65,it won't do that yeah it'll just be

0:36:07.660,0:36:13.96,something that I feel would provide the

0:36:11.650,0:36:18.73,kind of closure that I that I that I

0:36:13.960,0:36:21.43,think would work yeah and so okay so

0:36:18.730,0:36:23.86,essentially you you are writing I don't

0:36:21.430,0:36:26.86,know if you chronologically or know it

0:36:23.860,0:36:28.75,is chronological okay now it just as you

0:36:26.860,0:36:30.40,build it in Tilden village and that's

0:36:28.750,0:36:31.90,and the revision process and the

0:36:30.400,0:36:33.64,composition process are all happening at

0:36:31.900,0:36:38.32,the same time yep and that's happening

0:36:33.640,0:36:40.00,in in concert with the other poems in

0:36:38.320,0:36:42.69,the book or are you usually focused on

0:36:40.000,0:36:46.15,one until it's done and then you move on

0:36:42.690,0:36:49.17,I'm focused on one but I have a pretty

0:36:46.150,0:36:51.70,good sense of where it might go

0:36:49.170,0:36:55.27,organizationally in relation to the

0:36:51.700,0:36:58.03,others except except right at the

0:36:55.270,0:37:01.99,beginning of the project ya know at that

0:36:58.030,0:37:05.41,point I you know I'm not I'm not clear

0:37:01.990,0:37:12.82,on what's missing right you know it's

0:37:05.410,0:37:16.30,race I'm I'm working toward beginning to

0:37:12.820,0:37:20.59,understand what the whole might might

0:37:16.300,0:37:25.54,contain yeah but I just have to wait

0:37:20.590,0:37:30.01,until I mean if I think of the last two

0:37:25.540,0:37:34.18,books they're they're six poems in

0:37:30.010,0:37:37.45,capacity and eight poems here eight

0:37:34.180,0:37:39.76,poems in the most recent one and and

0:37:37.450,0:37:42.55,that's in both cases that's a small

0:37:39.760,0:37:44.80,enough number that I'm not sure we're in

0:37:42.550,0:37:48.13,the process of writing either of those

0:37:44.800,0:37:48.70,books whether took me three or four

0:37:48.130,0:37:50.77,poems

0:37:48.700,0:37:52.99,to have a sense of what else I needed

0:37:50.770,0:37:55.93,yes but it was somewhere in there you

0:37:52.990,0:37:58.06,know because it was like Midway then I

0:37:55.930,0:37:59.50,then I'd be a little clearer can you

0:37:58.060,0:38:01.86,talk a little bit about like what that

0:37:59.500,0:38:05.17,point is at the beginning of a project

0:38:01.869,0:38:06.25,like how that does it is there something

0:38:05.170,0:38:08.61,starting to emerge and you're thinking

0:38:06.250,0:38:16.66,in your reading or where does that come

0:38:08.619,0:38:20.38,from again I have to I have to learn

0:38:16.660,0:38:23.05,what it's possible to learn about the

0:38:20.380,0:38:36.09,first and the second poem that I that I

0:38:23.050,0:38:39.42,write in any of the projects and if I

0:38:36.099,0:38:42.55,think about this most recent book I I

0:38:39.420,0:38:45.49,was commissioned by the New York Times

0:38:42.550,0:38:48.15,to write a Thanksgiving poem and that

0:38:45.490,0:38:53.10,was the first poem that I wrote for that

0:38:48.150,0:38:58.63,for this most recent book and I wrote it

0:38:53.109,0:39:04.56,and I kept taking my notes on on all of

0:38:58.630,0:39:07.11,the things that I was reading and and

0:39:04.569,0:39:09.97,was caught up in the reading and the

0:39:07.119,0:39:13.06,note-taking and all of that and all of

0:39:09.970,0:39:15.76,it was to the end of my getting started

0:39:13.060,0:39:19.90,on a second poem and I had no idea what

0:39:15.760,0:39:23.80,that was for two years and then and then

0:39:19.900,0:39:26.47,that poem came out of Proverbs and then

0:39:23.800,0:39:30.39,I spent another year and a half before I

0:39:26.470,0:39:36.22,had any lines at all on a third poem and

0:39:30.390,0:39:39.30,and I looked back over four and a half

0:39:36.220,0:39:42.01,to five year period in which I had

0:39:39.300,0:39:44.38,written two poems

0:39:42.010,0:39:47.25,neither of them particularly long the

0:39:44.380,0:39:50.10,longer of the two was four pages and

0:39:47.250,0:39:54.40,that was all I had I didn't have a page

0:39:50.109,0:39:58.89,a year essentially and and I don't for

0:39:54.400,0:40:02.14,the life of me understand why I didn't

0:39:58.890,0:40:03.43,just accept that I was through writing I

0:40:02.140,0:40:06.73,you know I mean that that should have

0:40:03.430,0:40:09.06,been enough but but that wasn't that

0:40:06.730,0:40:14.07,wasn't what I felt and I don't know why

0:40:09.069,0:40:16.28,but I didn't and and then and then I

0:40:14.079,0:40:18.81,guess I'd taught myself enough about

0:40:16.289,0:40:23.10,what I was trying to learn in the whole

0:40:18.819,0:40:25.42,project that it got underway and and

0:40:23.109,0:40:28.69,then and then there was a momentum to it

0:40:25.420,0:40:30.75,but I don't really remember in any of

0:40:28.690,0:40:33.46,the other in any of the other books that

0:40:30.759,0:40:36.33,I wrote there was a kind of momentum in

0:40:33.460,0:40:38.89,writing and writing for good things but

0:40:36.339,0:40:41.04,it was it was a momentum that that I

0:40:38.890,0:40:43.21,would describe as documentary

0:40:41.049,0:40:45.64,even though there's an autobiographical

0:40:43.210,0:40:51.59,element to it it was as if I could hear

0:40:45.640,0:40:55.47,some kind of narrator in a documentary

0:40:51.599,0:41:01.26,saying this thing or that and and and

0:40:55.470,0:41:03.74,the form of the thing was usually more

0:41:01.269,0:41:06.33,than a ten syllable line in this

0:41:03.749,0:41:09.67,monolithic block that looked kind of

0:41:06.339,0:41:15.98,like prose but still had a jam and some

0:41:09.670,0:41:19.32,and and and was lines and so so I had

0:41:15.989,0:41:24.40,that gave me a kind of momentum but but

0:41:19.329,0:41:27.73,very different from from what I from the

0:41:24.400,0:41:29.38,lack of momentum that I had when I began

0:41:27.730,0:41:30.78,this book anyway I mean it just it

0:41:29.380,0:41:34.39,wasn't any I didn't know where it was

0:41:30.789,0:41:36.70,going to come from and you um I guess in

0:41:34.390,0:41:38.92,those said that you're you were I'm

0:41:36.700,0:41:40.48,teaching yourself to get to the point

0:41:38.920,0:41:43.50,where you could get that momentum back

0:41:40.480,0:41:47.10,and start and start writing more what

0:41:43.509,0:41:48.70,what are those what are those parts of

0:41:47.109,0:41:50.89,your life look like in terms of your

0:41:48.700,0:41:52.80,you're writing your prep your practice I

0:41:50.890,0:41:55.18,mean you're still waking up and working

0:41:52.809,0:41:57.27,and I mean in your writing and your

0:41:55.180,0:41:59.82,readings that are taking notes all the

0:41:57.279,0:42:01.72,time can you describe how that works how

0:41:59.829,0:42:04.53,that part of your practice works and

0:42:01.720,0:42:06.97,that's been pretty steadily since

0:42:04.539,0:42:11.34,beginning or since you started writing

0:42:06.970,0:42:14.31,for well act yeah yes although all all

0:42:11.349,0:42:15.40,the way back and I think I think the

0:42:14.319,0:42:19.21,reading and note

0:42:15.400,0:42:23.19,taking part of it has gotten to be more

0:42:19.210,0:42:25.56,dominant over the course of the time

0:42:23.190,0:42:27.94,these notebooks and they're about

0:42:25.569,0:42:30.94,probably ten others than the ones that

0:42:27.940,0:42:34.77,fit in that shelf right there that's

0:42:30.940,0:42:39.88,about four years worth okay and and

0:42:34.770,0:42:42.81,prior to those I was working with five

0:42:39.880,0:42:45.57,by eight cards writing in longhand and

0:42:42.819,0:42:48.54,then that just got organ that got to be

0:42:45.579,0:42:51.09,too hard to keep track of so I had boxes

0:42:48.549,0:42:54.22,of them and you know arranged

0:42:51.099,0:42:57.16,alphabetically but this this is a this

0:42:54.220,0:43:00.64,is an improvement on that it's just

0:42:57.160,0:43:03.06,though it's more it's something I can

0:43:00.640,0:43:04.86,find and I've index T so I can find my

0:43:03.069,0:43:07.15,way around these books in a way that the

0:43:04.869,0:43:09.84,cards were just there just got to be too

0:43:07.150,0:43:12.16,many of them and so the cards you had

0:43:09.849,0:43:13.42,them in life just like regular cards

0:43:12.160,0:43:15.91,like we would you flip through to my

0:43:13.420,0:43:17.58,cattle and carceral deliver except I

0:43:15.910,0:43:19.83,wouldn't flip through them that's the

0:43:17.589,0:43:22.00,thing so they just they didn't invite me

0:43:19.839,0:43:23.89,back to them the way these do you know I

0:43:22.000,0:43:26.74,can I can take one of these down at

0:43:23.890,0:43:30.64,random and be reminded pretty quickly of

0:43:26.740,0:43:32.74,why it was that particular book that I

0:43:30.640,0:43:36.13,was reading and why I was having the

0:43:32.740,0:43:37.32,responses to it that I did do you mind

0:43:36.130,0:43:40.74,grabbing wanted to know just kind of

0:43:37.329,0:43:40.74,showing how you do this

0:43:49.520,0:44:01.50,where do you have it

0:43:52.280,0:44:03.96,frightfully we'll get it in the frame so

0:44:01.500,0:44:05.76,let's see if I can find some pages here

0:44:03.960,0:44:10.80,where I've gone i got eatle or pictures

0:44:05.760,0:44:13.71,of these you don't want to model I work

0:44:10.800,0:44:16.10,on the I work on these are the notes

0:44:13.710,0:44:18.65,that I would take for for the book that

0:44:16.109,0:44:23.42,I'm that I'm reading hmm

0:44:18.650,0:44:26.52,the red is the is the more important

0:44:23.420,0:44:29.73,material it's something that that if I'm

0:44:26.520,0:44:32.84,going through it I can I can read and

0:44:29.730,0:44:37.80,just pick pick out the highlighted parts

0:44:32.849,0:44:41.73,okay then then green are my own

0:44:37.800,0:44:43.95,responses and and so I'm working always

0:44:41.730,0:44:46.80,on the right-hand page when I'm taking

0:44:43.950,0:44:48.96,notes from books I'm reading then when

0:44:46.800,0:44:51.03,I'm going back over the material I'll

0:44:48.960,0:44:53.73,work on this page okay and they'll be

0:44:51.030,0:44:55.07,other changes and usually more green

0:44:53.730,0:44:57.11,will turn up okay

0:44:55.079,0:44:59.70,and that's your response to okay again

0:44:57.119,0:45:05.93,and so you say you in how do you index

0:44:59.700,0:45:10.76,them just by by title and see I've got

0:45:05.930,0:45:13.74,I've got some of those pages here and

0:45:10.760,0:45:16.26,indexes my title of work that you're

0:45:13.740,0:45:19.65,reading and where did they go see I

0:45:16.260,0:45:29.01,should know where they are Debbie but I

0:45:19.650,0:45:32.40,had the Sheep ha ha ha ha we can't find

0:45:29.010,0:45:34.95,them now they were usually in this red

0:45:32.400,0:45:37.80,notebook so they're their pages their

0:45:34.950,0:45:42.03,pages of an index that that had that are

0:45:37.800,0:45:43.71,arranged according to the notebook

0:45:42.030,0:45:46.77,numbers and

0:45:43.710,0:45:48.93,and they're here Susan just rearranged

0:45:46.770,0:45:54.96,them they're somewhere in here they're

0:45:48.930,0:45:56.46,not lost okay I hope so so that I can

0:45:54.960,0:45:58.17,just find my way to the notebook and

0:45:56.460,0:45:59.09,it'll have the page numbers and

0:45:58.170,0:46:02.67,everything

0:45:59.099,0:46:05.25,well Oh Oh then then in the front of yes

0:46:02.670,0:46:09.21,then in the front of each notebook I

0:46:05.250,0:46:13.17,have the title and and the page numbers

0:46:09.210,0:46:15.35,okay oh okay and and so you know you can

0:46:13.170,0:46:16.85,go back and find the words of work that

0:46:15.359,0:46:19.19,you were thinking about this is whatever

0:46:16.859,0:46:19.19,you write

0:46:31.740,0:46:54.69,ah and okay my music you know I have a

0:46:52.619,0:46:57.18,new appreciation for dogs too you know

0:46:54.690,0:47:02.10,sorry first dog though would she be

0:46:57.180,0:47:05.43,smelling Rufus on you know maybe maybe

0:47:02.100,0:47:14.61,I'll do jeans yeah my knees are not so

0:47:05.430,0:47:16.80,crazy so the so the index cards were

0:47:14.610,0:47:18.84,they cards there were cars okay and

0:47:16.800,0:47:20.46,that's what she'll like I can I think

0:47:18.840,0:47:31.53,wow man oh if I have them

0:47:20.460,0:47:32.88,she may have moved those can move them

0:47:31.530,0:47:34.31,somewhere I don't know where they've

0:47:32.880,0:47:38.60,gone

0:47:34.310,0:47:38.60,okay okay

0:47:39.080,0:47:45.68,Michelle wanted one she I gave her one

0:47:42.119,0:47:45.68,and she framed it Oh

0:47:49.359,0:47:56.31,so we know all that in all that no

0:47:53.529,0:47:57.99,taking in so safely I mean is there like

0:47:56.319,0:47:59.89,a hypothetical where you could say like

0:47:57.999,0:48:03.40,I used only index to find something and

0:47:59.890,0:48:06.72,in that led to a line or how would that

0:48:03.400,0:48:09.81,I guess what's that process like it that

0:48:06.729,0:48:12.80,that is the way it tends to work and yet

0:48:09.819,0:48:17.61,I can't go back once I've got the line

0:48:12.809,0:48:21.70,unless I'm quoting right I can't I can't

0:48:17.619,0:48:26.07,make a connection there's just there's

0:48:21.700,0:48:29.38,just some kind of break something gets

0:48:26.079,0:48:34.45,suggested and I I can never reconstruct

0:48:29.380,0:48:36.94,it okay Wow another way to say it is

0:48:34.450,0:48:39.47,that I think the reading it feels like

0:48:36.940,0:48:43.32,the reading does this to me like it just

0:48:39.479,0:48:45.51,pulls me out towards stuff that other

0:48:43.329,0:48:50.49,people the writers of the books I'm

0:48:45.519,0:48:55.56,taking notes on are more connected to

0:48:50.499,0:48:59.92,than I am but they do a good enough job

0:48:55.569,0:49:03.33,of saying what their connections to it

0:48:59.920,0:49:07.61,are that that the things I'm reading

0:49:03.339,0:49:10.56,become suggestive to me of things that I

0:49:07.619,0:49:13.93,didn't know that that they make

0:49:10.569,0:49:16.59,available and then and then and then

0:49:13.930,0:49:20.49,that gives me the sense that there's

0:49:16.599,0:49:26.28,less I've failed to address you know and

0:49:20.499,0:49:28.83,and therefore maybe I'm maybe I'd been

0:49:26.289,0:49:32.10,brought to a position with their help of

0:49:28.839,0:49:36.21,being able to find a phrase that lets me

0:49:32.109,0:49:41.52,move from this point and where I am with

0:49:36.219,0:49:46.41,the poem I'm writing further along how

0:49:41.529,0:49:46.41,you choose the books that you're reading

0:49:50.830,0:49:58.64,the disciplines that that have that I've

0:49:55.010,0:50:07.18,gone back to more and more than any

0:49:58.640,0:50:07.18,others or philosophy theology history

0:50:07.270,0:50:15.07,psychology sociology anthropology

0:50:15.130,0:50:24.20,and and and one or another of those will

0:50:21.260,0:50:29.99,seem like it's more pertinent depending

0:50:24.200,0:50:34.07,on where I am in a process and and so so

0:50:29.990,0:50:37.99,I'm on Amazon a lot and truck stopped in

0:50:34.070,0:50:48.47,front of the house fairly frequently and

0:50:37.990,0:50:51.11,and I'm helped enormously by by you know

0:50:48.470,0:50:56.11,the succession of books that turn up at

0:50:51.110,0:50:56.11,the door that that I have the time to

0:50:57.850,0:51:05.06,you know indulge myself with right and

0:51:01.430,0:51:06.74,do this I mean so you mentioned Amazon

0:51:05.060,0:51:08.60,are you using like the recommendations

0:51:06.740,0:51:10.82,the Amazon provides you are you usually

0:51:08.600,0:51:12.56,finding a book from another book I'm

0:51:10.820,0:51:14.87,usually finding a book from another book

0:51:12.560,0:51:17.36,they do send me the monthly thing here's

0:51:14.870,0:51:24.71,here's my list and I go through it but

0:51:17.360,0:51:26.24,I'm usually ahead of them okay but

0:51:24.710,0:51:36.11,they're not but they're not bad at it

0:51:26.240,0:51:38.24,huh yeah they're cha yeah so going back

0:51:36.110,0:51:40.82,then you said then so that every book

0:51:38.240,0:51:43.13,until this last book was composed in

0:51:40.820,0:51:45.11,longhand yes and then on a typewriter

0:51:43.130,0:51:48.01,what what's the change then for this

0:51:45.110,0:51:48.01,fine for this fine

0:51:54.510,0:51:58.98,there was there was as I said before

0:51:56.490,0:52:03.33,there was just a surprise that I wasn't

0:51:58.980,0:52:06.57,I wasn't at all missing the typing the

0:52:03.330,0:52:08.88,typing stage probably because it was all

0:52:06.570,0:52:11.82,typing so it was as if that's what

0:52:08.880,0:52:14.82,happened with this machine was that the

0:52:11.820,0:52:18.84,long hand and the typing just coalesced

0:52:14.820,0:52:21.81,and became the same activity and and it

0:52:18.840,0:52:22.53,I don't I don't feel it made any of it

0:52:21.810,0:52:26.31,any quicker

0:52:22.530,0:52:30.96,I mean it probably did but that wasn't

0:52:26.310,0:52:33.27,the sense I had of it it was it was less

0:52:30.960,0:52:35.79,cumbersome you know because it sits here

0:52:33.270,0:52:40.07,and I put it over here and yeah and and

0:52:35.790,0:52:43.68,all of that but it seemed like a very

0:52:40.070,0:52:46.32,easy transition I don't miss the

0:52:43.680,0:52:49.02,typewriter which I loved

0:52:46.320,0:52:51.45,you know but I don't miss it I think

0:52:49.020,0:53:00.75,it's in my storage space about two miles

0:52:51.450,0:53:02.58,away from here you know and so it was

0:53:00.750,0:53:06.44,just it couldn't have been an easy or

0:53:02.580,0:53:09.45,shift you know from from from that

0:53:06.440,0:53:11.46,technology to this one I don't do and so

0:53:09.450,0:53:13.35,I just declare if I for myself

0:53:11.460,0:53:16.20,are you still doing the long end

0:53:13.350,0:53:16.92,composition or this all of that work now

0:53:16.200,0:53:19.20,happening

0:53:16.920,0:53:21.39,it's all happening here except when I

0:53:19.200,0:53:24.21,don't take the computer with me say to

0:53:21.390,0:53:26.61,Idaho okay then I will work in longhand

0:53:24.210,0:53:29.37,yeah so I'll take it I'll print out

0:53:26.610,0:53:31.02,whatever it is of whatever it is I have

0:53:29.370,0:53:33.27,of the thing I'm working on

0:53:31.020,0:53:35.82,and I'll take that printed copy with me

0:53:33.270,0:53:38.61,and then I'll just work with work on

0:53:35.820,0:53:40.44,longhand with it leaving the computer

0:53:38.610,0:53:42.03,here and then I'll be back in three

0:53:40.440,0:53:45.54,weeks or something like that and then

0:53:42.030,0:53:48.30,you know reincorporated into into the

0:53:45.540,0:53:51.18,what I've got here in my files okay so

0:53:48.300,0:53:53.46,one thing I guess I might so in the

0:53:51.180,0:53:56.46,composition stage are you do you still

0:53:53.460,0:53:58.71,do like strikethrough yeah yeah okay I

0:53:56.460,0:54:00.30,work pretty much the way I worked before

0:53:58.710,0:54:02.43,you've just transferred those processes

0:54:00.300,0:54:04.26,on the computer yes did it take some

0:54:02.430,0:54:08.61,time to figure out how to do that no it

0:54:04.260,0:54:13.08,fairly you know yeah and I and I I guess

0:54:08.610,0:54:18.30,I mean then then another aspect of it is

0:54:13.080,0:54:23.04,letters that I write here yeah so so I'm

0:54:18.300,0:54:26.49,doing I'm doing whatever revision I do

0:54:23.040,0:54:29.07,of the the emails I send right here on

0:54:26.490,0:54:30.69,this so it's in that way it so this is

0:54:29.070,0:54:35.19,this makes it a little more personal

0:54:30.690,0:54:36.93,since I can't remember what it was like

0:54:35.190,0:54:38.46,to write a letter to somebody that

0:54:36.930,0:54:42.42,wasn't you know it wasn't one of these

0:54:38.460,0:54:45.66,and and and I understand that you know

0:54:42.420,0:54:48.99,that letters you post aren't anymore and

0:54:45.660,0:54:54.75,bases and then something you send here

0:54:48.990,0:54:59.40,but I love how non-invasive this is as a

0:54:54.750,0:55:01.86,medium and and not not so much in terms

0:54:59.400,0:55:04.53,of my being protected against being

0:55:01.860,0:55:07.26,invaded by somebody else yeah but being

0:55:04.530,0:55:09.42,able to say something you know send

0:55:07.260,0:55:12.57,somebody something here and understand

0:55:09.420,0:55:15.24,that they can open it when they want and

0:55:12.570,0:55:18.78,that it's not it's not an imposition on

0:55:15.240,0:55:20.31,them and so I explained that a little

0:55:18.780,0:55:22.26,bit so the non-invasive part are you

0:55:20.310,0:55:24.87,think so you feel like the letter was

0:55:22.260,0:55:28.59,more invasive no I think it probably

0:55:24.870,0:55:32.07,wasn't but but it but I but it took more

0:55:28.590,0:55:36.78,trouble to write it yeah and post it and

0:55:32.070,0:55:39.42,you know you 32 cents or whatever it was

0:55:36.780,0:55:41.88,whatever a letter cost to send before I

0:55:39.420,0:55:45.74,started doing this and then I have it

0:55:41.880,0:55:49.44,then I have a friend who's a lifer and

0:55:45.740,0:55:52.38,he doesn't have a computer so so it's

0:55:49.440,0:55:57.08,with Robbie that I correspond you know

0:55:52.380,0:55:59.70,by by snail mail yeah and you're those

0:55:57.080,0:56:01.35,those feel different now I mean might it

0:55:59.700,0:56:02.82,be sort of a more of a difficult thing

0:56:01.350,0:56:06.09,to get up to write together

0:56:02.820,0:56:08.22,yes it is and and I wind up writing it

0:56:06.090,0:56:09.45,here and printing it out and signing it

0:56:08.220,0:56:12.24,and putting it in the mail

0:56:09.450,0:56:20.25,yeah yeah and then his letters to me are

0:56:12.240,0:56:23.18,all in longhand okay I guess and then in

0:56:20.250,0:56:26.91,keeping with this latest work when you

0:56:23.180,0:56:29.37,went back to revise the poems they did

0:56:26.910,0:56:31.23,that was fairly similar process to I

0:56:29.370,0:56:34.89,mean I think it was exactly that time

0:56:31.230,0:56:38.46,yeah and then kind of the general

0:56:34.890,0:56:42.42,question about your revision process and

0:56:38.460,0:56:44.82,this is one is accountable and this is a

0:56:42.420,0:56:47.94,little bit repetitive but are they so

0:56:44.820,0:56:50.34,are the revisions driven by sound by

0:56:47.940,0:56:52.32,meaning machine by structure are these

0:56:50.340,0:56:56.58,all kind of intertwining I think they

0:56:52.320,0:56:59.16,are okay and it's you know it has to be

0:56:56.580,0:57:00.24,it just has to be what can your ear bear

0:56:59.160,0:57:03.81,hear you know

0:57:00.240,0:57:06.36,yeah and and and if it can bear it is it

0:57:03.810,0:57:07.65,saying what it has to be saying so

0:57:06.360,0:57:10.20,that's kind of step one and step two

0:57:07.650,0:57:12.72,yeah for yeah and and they're probably

0:57:10.200,0:57:15.12,inseparable right right

0:57:12.720,0:57:18.29,do other people play a process in your

0:57:15.120,0:57:18.29,revisions or your working

0:57:19.700,0:57:28.53,yes they do I'll send them draft and get

0:57:26.550,0:57:37.68,responses from them that are almost

0:57:28.530,0:57:43.89,always helped and and they're helpful in

0:57:37.680,0:57:46.65,terms of in terms less of my being able

0:57:43.890,0:57:52.26,to meet what they might have preferred

0:57:46.650,0:57:55.77,to having what they've said to me help

0:57:52.260,0:57:58.92,me prefer what happens once I've made

0:57:55.770,0:58:00.18,the revisions and oh and are those have

0:57:58.920,0:58:03.41,those people stayed the same throughout

0:58:00.180,0:58:03.41,the career they've changed

0:58:07.340,0:58:15.78,yeah it's it's there have been a couple

0:58:12.410,0:58:17.09,who were new in the last four or five

0:58:15.780,0:58:20.45,years on this

0:58:17.090,0:58:22.91,on this most recent book ya colleagues

0:58:20.450,0:58:24.89,and and we'll how will that process work

0:58:22.910,0:58:27.59,will you now like email them to section

0:58:24.890,0:58:29.99,and whereas before you might send them a

0:58:27.590,0:58:32.36,letter with the section or yeah it's

0:58:29.990,0:58:36.74,easier yeah this makes it a lot easier

0:58:32.360,0:58:40.04,to do and and then of course I get I get

0:58:36.740,0:58:46.34,work from from from people in the storm

0:58:40.040,0:58:49.49,- yeah and I like I like that and I've

0:58:46.340,0:58:52.91,liked it in I mean I haven't taught now

0:58:49.490,0:58:58.10,for a year and a half but but I've I've

0:58:52.910,0:59:01.28,really liked the way the computer makes

0:58:58.100,0:59:03.32,it possible to read any eight poems that

0:59:01.280,0:59:06.65,I've gotten from students just to give

0:59:03.320,0:59:10.28,them a sense of how I hear what they're

0:59:06.650,0:59:12.86,doing with the line it's been it's been

0:59:10.280,0:59:16.88,helped though it's been helped to me I

0:59:12.860,0:59:21.08,haven't seen much evidence that it means

0:59:16.880,0:59:21.92,anything I tell you selected it's a

0:59:21.080,0:59:23.81,valuable lesson

0:59:21.920,0:59:30.29,oh good thank you or you may be the only

0:59:23.810,0:59:37.28,one sometimes it difficult interesting

0:59:30.290,0:59:41.07,to learn but excessively valuable and

0:59:37.280,0:59:43.68,okay let me look at this room

0:59:41.070,0:59:44.28,if you want to take a break I'm fine

0:59:43.680,0:59:53.40,okay

0:59:44.280,0:59:55.41,91 take a break so how did you keep

0:59:53.400,0:59:57.48,track of all these things I mean I guess

0:59:55.410,1:00:01.16,with the computer experiment you have

0:59:57.480,1:00:04.26,one file with all of them in it yes okay

1:00:01.160,1:00:05.97,and then before that we're there where

1:00:04.260,1:00:09.03,you did you just have them in a binder

1:00:05.970,1:00:11.90,or just loose pages probably with it

1:00:09.030,1:00:15.78,with a clip probably okay and with that

1:00:11.900,1:00:17.24,as you got the manuscript more towards

1:00:15.780,1:00:21.36,what you wanted that just grow bigger

1:00:17.240,1:00:23.94,now it severely easy going to be done

1:00:21.360,1:00:25.35,yeah okay so there wasn't like some of

1:00:23.940,1:00:26.40,the other riders have had you know they

1:00:25.350,1:00:27.75,have their stress or no clothes they

1:00:26.400,1:00:29.55,have a kind of like process where they

1:00:27.750,1:00:31.92,move from notebook to this to this and I

1:00:29.550,1:00:34.56,wasn't know that part of the writing was

1:00:31.920,1:00:36.63,never that no and those and those files

1:00:34.560,1:00:38.46,in that sort of the ephemeral is never

1:00:36.630,1:00:42.06,it doesn't seem that it was that dear to

1:00:38.460,1:00:43.77,you know and it's still not know okay um

1:00:42.060,1:00:46.86,do you know have you ever thought about

1:00:43.770,1:00:48.21,why all I care about is the product

1:00:46.860,1:00:50.19,that's all I care about

1:00:48.210,1:00:53.49,and when do you and what do you consider

1:00:50.190,1:00:56.03,the product the poem that I can't make

1:00:53.490,1:00:56.03,any better

1:00:59.190,1:01:05.88,if you I guess and so in the same way

1:01:04.440,1:01:08.43,that the computer how do you feel about

1:01:05.880,1:01:09.90,the computer files you like try to you

1:01:08.430,1:01:11.46,have much sort of sense of like trying

1:01:09.900,1:01:13.32,to maintain them and keep them or they

1:01:11.460,1:01:19.73,just sort of mean getting it to that

1:01:13.320,1:01:24.60,point they're there the work in progress

1:01:19.730,1:01:28.29,at at the most recent stage yeah if I'm

1:01:24.600,1:01:32.85,going to get on an airplane I'll I'll

1:01:28.290,1:01:35.13,send I'll send what I've got on the book

1:01:32.850,1:01:38.49,as a whole to a couple of people okay

1:01:35.130,1:01:39.00,and you know they'll understand why I

1:01:38.490,1:01:42.96,did it

1:01:39.000,1:01:46.68,yeah you know so and that would be that

1:01:42.960,1:01:49.41,would be one of the one of the later

1:01:46.680,1:01:51.42,things that I would do before we got on

1:01:49.410,1:01:56.40,the car to take us to the airport yeah

1:01:51.420,1:02:00.51,so it's egomaniacal

1:01:56.400,1:02:05.25,you know and it's way yeah but it's also

1:02:00.510,1:02:08.91,work it's my work yeah and then I guess

1:02:05.250,1:02:11.52,so the product upon that where does it

1:02:08.910,1:02:13.56,exist is it in the book is it in just a

1:02:11.520,1:02:15.18,printed out page is it I mean I know you

1:02:13.560,1:02:18.90,I know you're a very strong you know

1:02:15.180,1:02:20.67,phone enough of the oral poems I guess

1:02:18.900,1:02:23.70,that's that's sort of a larger question

1:02:20.670,1:02:27.15,but where is it I guess it's in the book

1:02:23.700,1:02:30.78,in the book yeah yeah and I would want I

1:02:27.150,1:02:36.18,would want form which in my case is of a

1:02:30.780,1:02:42.71,line and the stanza I would want form to

1:02:36.180,1:02:46.61,instruct a reader of that book on how I

1:02:42.710,1:02:52.20,hear the phrases in the sentences great

1:02:46.610,1:02:54.99,great do you ever record yourself doing

1:02:52.200,1:02:56.46,interviewer that like recorded yourself

1:02:54.990,1:03:00.99,reading a book or has ever anybody ever

1:02:56.460,1:03:05.25,asked you to do that I did read somebody

1:03:00.990,1:03:07.18,recorded all of capacity Matt Nelson did

1:03:05.250,1:03:12.17,it

1:03:07.180,1:03:14.71,some years ago I did I did I was asked

1:03:12.170,1:03:20.59,to do some for the for one of those New

1:03:14.719,1:03:22.57,York yeah Society Poetry Society or I

1:03:20.599,1:03:25.70,can't remember what the others are but I

1:03:22.579,1:03:29.15,did I have recorded some things I'd like

1:03:25.700,1:03:31.99,doing it but it's been it's only been

1:03:29.150,1:03:38.34,when somebody's asked me for a recording

1:03:31.999,1:03:38.34,okay I think that would be as valuable

1:03:41.380,1:03:44.66,we've got we actually kind of

1:03:43.309,1:03:47.89,organically answered a lot of the

1:03:44.660,1:03:47.89,questions I have so that's nice

1:03:57.240,1:04:04.24,this is little off-topic but defeat has

1:04:01.870,1:04:06.28,the internet changed the way that you do

1:04:04.240,1:04:07.54,any of this process has the kind of

1:04:06.280,1:04:09.85,availability of all this extra

1:04:07.540,1:04:13.57,information allows you to maybe find

1:04:09.850,1:04:15.85,books or find ideas or research online

1:04:13.570,1:04:20.82,in a way that changed anything for your

1:04:15.850,1:04:24.10,writing I'm so bad at this that that

1:04:20.820,1:04:26.65,Amazon's been like about the only

1:04:24.100,1:04:29.77,resource that I've okay that I've been

1:04:26.650,1:04:32.50,helped by I'm sure there's a lot cells

1:04:29.770,1:04:36.70,there but it hasn't it hasn't served me

1:04:32.500,1:04:40.48,I'll Google some things but not much not

1:04:36.700,1:04:42.01,much and you have I mean why do you feel

1:04:40.480,1:04:45.19,like you're bad at it I guess it's a

1:04:42.010,1:04:46.81,question is it just something but it's

1:04:45.190,1:04:48.43,something that I mean is it something

1:04:46.810,1:04:51.04,you feel like kind of naturally

1:04:48.430,1:04:55.87,inherently bad at yes I feel naturally

1:04:51.040,1:04:57.19,inherently bad and in the time that

1:04:55.870,1:04:59.53,you've sort of attempted to teach

1:04:57.190,1:05:00.73,yourself it's just not something that's

1:04:59.530,1:05:04.24,come naturally and not something that

1:05:00.730,1:05:06.28,you I guess needed it's not I think yeah

1:05:04.240,1:05:11.11,I think if I if I had needed it more I

1:05:06.280,1:05:13.33,probably would have availed myself of it

1:05:11.110,1:05:15.52,more and taught myself how to do it and

1:05:13.330,1:05:25.45,I guess yeah I guess I haven't felt a

1:05:15.520,1:05:28.30,need of it yeah and just and just for

1:05:25.450,1:05:30.64,again you're like where where's your

1:05:28.300,1:05:32.08,files and folders kind of reside on your

1:05:30.640,1:05:34.03,computer are they do you have like a

1:05:32.080,1:05:36.07,folder for that book with all the drafts

1:05:34.030,1:05:38.38,or is it just one document just one

1:05:36.070,1:05:40.24,document so it's the most recent it's

1:05:38.380,1:05:42.49,the most recent okay and that's how it

1:05:40.240,1:05:44.83,works for almost everything yes okay and

1:05:42.490,1:05:47.23,and I think that would be related to

1:05:44.830,1:05:49.42,what you probably remember is that you

1:05:47.230,1:05:52.57,know if I'm if I'm seeing students

1:05:49.420,1:05:55.15,revisions I'm interested in and the one

1:05:52.570,1:05:56.86,that they feel is the strongest and I'm

1:05:55.150,1:06:00.37,not going to compare it to earlier

1:05:56.860,1:06:02.56,things you know I'm just I I want I want

1:06:00.370,1:06:04.72,them to be making that call and that's

1:06:02.560,1:06:07.29,what I want them to hear from me back

1:06:04.720,1:06:09.54,about right great

1:06:07.290,1:06:11.04,how do you mean and you sort of spoke

1:06:09.540,1:06:13.36,about this in here and describing

1:06:11.040,1:06:16.50,earlier practices I mean how did you

1:06:13.369,1:06:22.20,learn how did you get that acumen in

1:06:16.500,1:06:25.40,sort of being able to tell hi I don't

1:06:22.200,1:06:28.83,know I mean I listening to a lot of

1:06:25.400,1:06:30.42,great great music I think I mean I that

1:06:28.830,1:06:31.49,would that would make more sense to me

1:06:30.420,1:06:34.80,than anything else

1:06:31.490,1:06:36.63,okay and what I mean what was the is

1:06:34.800,1:06:38.94,there a bridge in their progression of

1:06:36.630,1:06:44.10,music did you look at can you talk a

1:06:38.940,1:06:53.58,little bit about that I I think I was

1:06:44.100,1:06:57.57,helped immeasurably by what I listen to

1:06:53.580,1:07:01.56,when I was 12 and 13 and just just in a

1:06:57.570,1:07:09.21,really bad way and that was that was

1:07:01.560,1:07:12.72,first jazz from the early 50s that got

1:07:09.210,1:07:19.73,that got to be more and more exclusively

1:07:12.720,1:07:24.89,black jazz and or black musicians and

1:07:19.730,1:07:27.86,and that got me through high school and

1:07:24.890,1:07:31.38,then and then I had other things to do

1:07:27.869,1:07:36.93,once I went to college yeah and and it

1:07:31.380,1:07:39.11,kind of was suspended pretty much all

1:07:36.930,1:07:41.70,the way through my undergraduate work

1:07:39.119,1:07:48.57,and my graduate work and then came back

1:07:41.700,1:07:55.53,once I had the job here and and so in

1:07:48.570,1:08:01.02,the late 60s it was you know it was it

1:07:55.530,1:08:04.10,was the popular music rock mostly and

1:08:01.020,1:08:07.50,and the stones and Hendrix were kind of

1:08:04.109,1:08:09.35,at the top of that list and then Hendrix

1:08:07.500,1:08:12.57,was dead and the stones weren't what

1:08:09.359,1:08:17.25,they had been and at that point there

1:08:12.570,1:08:22.17,was you know I had I had a need for

1:08:17.250,1:08:24.06,for music that got to me and and there

1:08:22.179,1:08:29.03,wasn't any more of it coming either from

1:08:24.069,1:08:31.31,jazz or from rock and so then I I

1:08:29.039,1:08:35.85,started learning classical you know

1:08:31.319,1:08:40.23,learning the literature of classical

1:08:35.859,1:08:49.11,music and and and it's it's had hold of

1:08:40.239,1:08:54.09,me since November of 1973 and and you

1:08:49.119,1:08:58.02,know I I feel that it strained my ear to

1:08:54.099,1:09:01.92,be what it is yeah I don't know how it's

1:08:58.029,1:09:03.88,done that but but it's been elemental to

1:09:01.929,1:09:05.50,me did you did you take any formal

1:09:03.880,1:09:07.92,non-case abuse you know you just

1:09:05.500,1:09:09.78,listening just listen and where would

1:09:07.929,1:09:11.50,you find how would you move how would

1:09:09.789,1:09:14.25,you find new things why would you focus

1:09:11.500,1:09:16.92,or progress from you know from composers

1:09:14.259,1:09:22.15,and from artists both so going at it

1:09:16.929,1:09:25.42,both ways yeah and have there been

1:09:22.150,1:09:27.46,particular composers that or artists at

1:09:25.420,1:09:30.25,times that you listen to more I mean is

1:09:27.460,1:09:31.75,there does it move forward or that's

1:09:30.250,1:09:37.32,been Mahler and baekeland

1:09:31.750,1:09:45.25,at the top and and then and then Brahms

1:09:37.329,1:09:48.25,and Bach and loads of others but but but

1:09:45.250,1:09:48.75,Mahler and Beethoven most of all and you

1:09:48.250,1:09:50.10,based

1:09:48.759,1:09:55.11,I mean you based one of your stand egg

1:09:50.109,1:09:56.88,forms on on the well it was Shirin Berg

1:09:55.119,1:10:00.25,who might whom I'm not that crazy about

1:09:56.889,1:10:05.28,but the twelve-tone system suggested to

1:10:00.250,1:10:08.38,me a stands a ik progression in which if

1:10:05.289,1:10:11.13,I got as I've had in the in the two most

1:10:08.380,1:10:15.19,recent books one two three four and five

1:10:11.139,1:10:18.42,line stanzas the twelve tone system in

1:10:15.190,1:10:21.63,which he would not come back to a note

1:10:18.429,1:10:26.34,until he had used the other eleven bring

1:10:21.639,1:10:30.91,the scale suggested to me a form in

1:10:26.349,1:10:36.57,which in which I would not

1:10:30.910,1:10:41.19,I would not interrupt the progression of

1:10:36.570,1:10:45.61,one-two-three-four-five until I'd

1:10:41.199,1:10:49.27,exhausted all of those five and then I

1:10:45.610,1:10:51.92,would begin the next sequence with

1:10:49.270,1:10:57.01,another number and try to have that

1:10:51.929,1:10:59.56,second sequence be as varied from the

1:10:57.010,1:11:02.73,first as I could be and continue that

1:10:59.560,1:11:04.87,all the way through and that's not to

1:11:02.739,1:11:08.05,say that I wouldn't wind up having a

1:11:04.870,1:11:10.17,three two one four five sequence

1:11:08.050,1:11:12.04,somewhere else in the poem but I'd want

1:11:10.179,1:11:20.02,it to be removed by several other

1:11:12.040,1:11:22.36,sequences so so variety is is one of the

1:11:20.020,1:11:24.52,models but that was the that that was

1:11:22.360,1:11:26.94,the form and that was and how did you

1:11:24.520,1:11:28.48,did you pick that up by listening or was

1:11:26.949,1:11:31.09,that from reading I mean are you reading

1:11:28.480,1:11:34.33,about it as well no I mean I just I just

1:11:31.090,1:11:36.01,knew what the twelve tone system was and

1:11:34.330,1:11:37.78,you know more about it than that you

1:11:36.010,1:11:40.30,know it's it's just like one sentence

1:11:37.780,1:11:42.69,thing yeah and so that suggested itself

1:11:40.300,1:11:44.71,to me and I began it with a poem I wrote

1:11:42.699,1:11:47.73,about Greenland called the world at

1:11:44.710,1:11:50.02,large and there I was working with one

1:11:47.739,1:11:53.02,two three and four I stopped at four

1:11:50.020,1:11:56.23,there's and then and then the next the

1:11:53.020,1:11:59.94,next time I I was into capacity into

1:11:56.230,1:12:03.40,that book then I I added a 5-line stanza

1:11:59.949,1:12:13.87,so it was more it's more more capacious

1:12:03.400,1:12:17.17,I would say - I would say - that when I

1:12:13.870,1:12:19.87,think back about moving from the late

1:12:17.170,1:12:23.48,60s when I was writing poems I didn't

1:12:19.870,1:12:28.96,like that weren't very good

1:12:23.489,1:12:33.63,into the early 70s I think there's

1:12:28.969,1:12:39.90,there's a non accidental relationship

1:12:33.630,1:12:44.03,between the forms I was working with

1:12:39.900,1:12:52.19,having been as short as a three-minute

1:12:44.030,1:12:58.67,cake you know and you know a sonata

1:12:52.190,1:13:01.29,Sonata form or a scherzo trio form or an

1:12:58.679,1:13:08.79,Adagio or something like that that's

1:13:01.290,1:13:12.65,that my the length of the the unit's

1:13:08.790,1:13:16.98,that I was working on got larger when I

1:13:12.659,1:13:19.26,was when I was listening to two pieces

1:13:16.980,1:13:23.40,of music that were you know there were

1:13:19.260,1:13:27.98,eight nine minutes to half an hour long

1:13:23.400,1:13:30.54,right in this and you're listening in

1:13:27.989,1:13:32.58,this crappy was it a very active

1:13:30.540,1:13:34.67,listening I'm using usually like you're

1:13:32.580,1:13:38.17,alone with music or listen to the heavy

1:13:34.679,1:13:40.78,with both Sam yeah

1:13:38.170,1:13:44.14,a lot of it you know spent on a lot of

1:13:40.780,1:13:47.35,time with it yeah and now are you ever

1:13:44.140,1:13:49.78,writing while that's all no no you get

1:13:47.350,1:13:51.21,this mansion to the media okay

1:13:49.780,1:14:00.42,and you sit and I still a part of your

1:13:51.219,1:14:02.17,process now yes okay I have a little bit

1:14:00.429,1:14:03.85,a few more questions on a little bit on

1:14:02.170,1:14:08.71,teaching and then just kind of important

1:14:03.850,1:14:10.44,and then questions and I eat it you just

1:14:08.710,1:14:12.13,speak about this with the computer kind

1:14:10.449,1:14:13.51,of changing your relationship with the

1:14:12.130,1:14:15.46,students you can give you can kind of

1:14:13.510,1:14:18.55,realign their palms to tell them how you

1:14:15.460,1:14:21.21,hear them is there any other ways that

1:14:18.550,1:14:23.44,you've seen this computer sort of age

1:14:21.219,1:14:25.33,like adjusting or affecting your

1:14:23.440,1:14:28.63,teaching and working with students I

1:14:25.330,1:14:35.14,don't think so it's made it it's made it

1:14:28.630,1:14:37.27,all more efficient in terms of you know

1:14:35.140,1:14:38.94,not having to go to the mailbox to get

1:14:37.270,1:14:41.32,the copies but to just come here and

1:14:38.949,1:14:43.63,here here's their poem not I've liked

1:14:41.320,1:14:50.05,that and yeah I think they liked it too

1:14:43.630,1:14:51.88,right do you see that they have I mean

1:14:50.050,1:14:54.94,do you see in your sort of later

1:14:51.880,1:14:56.89,students that there was like a increased

1:14:54.940,1:15:03.31,technological or cultural understanding

1:14:56.890,1:15:08.42,that affected their workers nope by me

1:15:03.310,1:15:12.52,I mean except except that that I think

1:15:08.429,1:15:15.82,there's probably a proclivity for exotic

1:15:12.520,1:15:16.48,words that they trust Google will help

1:15:15.820,1:15:20.29,you with

1:15:16.480,1:15:24.13,I think that's happened yeah yeah I

1:15:20.290,1:15:25.81,don't that's not necessarily a game but

1:15:24.130,1:15:31.81,it but it's not you know it's not

1:15:25.810,1:15:33.46,terribly yeah yeah no that and so I I

1:15:31.810,1:15:35.41,guess I just have you know like the kind

1:15:33.460,1:15:37.30,of blunt questions I mean that this sort

1:15:35.410,1:15:40.90,of you know the frame of my thing of my

1:15:37.300,1:15:41.92,study is what changes happen you know

1:15:40.900,1:15:44.44,what's this rise of the personal

1:15:41.920,1:15:46.88,computer I mean for you it seems like

1:15:44.440,1:15:48.78,maybe not that many

1:15:46.889,1:15:51.75,do you see I mean do you have any

1:15:48.780,1:15:54.30,opinions on on like kind of how is there

1:15:51.750,1:16:02.76,to change and feel a change in structure

1:15:54.300,1:16:05.04,or I like I like what's personal about

1:16:02.760,1:16:06.15,this medium in that way that I've

1:16:05.040,1:16:12.06,described already

1:16:06.150,1:16:16.61,I like the contact this machine gives me

1:16:12.060,1:16:23.06,with people I feel I feel it's certainly

1:16:16.619,1:16:26.55,more immediate I think it it's increased

1:16:23.060,1:16:30.84,the contact that I have with people who

1:16:26.550,1:16:33.03,are spread around the world it's been

1:16:30.840,1:16:35.19,more important to me since I don't go

1:16:33.030,1:16:38.25,into school and run into people that I

1:16:35.190,1:16:43.88,have conversations with right and I like

1:16:38.250,1:16:48.86,I like the fact that that it's this

1:16:43.889,1:16:51.44,keyboard that connects me with them and

1:16:48.860,1:16:54.44,this keyboard that connects me with

1:16:51.449,1:16:59.21,strangers who might read my poems yeah I

1:16:54.449,1:17:01.56,like I like that about this a lot right

1:16:59.219,1:17:05.28,I like it a lot I like it all the more

1:17:01.560,1:17:05.90,now that when the phone rings 90% of the

1:17:05.280,1:17:08.13,time

1:17:05.909,1:17:10.71,even though I've asked to be called by

1:17:08.130,1:17:12.78,telemarketers it's telemarketers yeah

1:17:10.710,1:17:15.75,because most of your conversations that

1:17:12.780,1:17:19.80,are important now are on yeah

1:17:15.750,1:17:21.96,and then I guess has that change the

1:17:19.800,1:17:25.65,poems I mean has that I don't think so

1:17:21.960,1:17:27.27,no but I can't but I can't know that you

1:17:25.650,1:17:29.52,know I mean it might well it might well

1:17:27.270,1:17:32.58,have yeah I mean it's you know it's

1:17:29.520,1:17:34.08,interesting to me I mean I I guess just

1:17:32.580,1:17:35.73,thinking of the Ulysses class and just

1:17:34.080,1:17:38.63,like you know thinking about that

1:17:35.730,1:17:41.19,connection people being so integral to

1:17:38.639,1:17:42.79,thinking about that book and about what

1:17:41.190,1:17:45.94,you were talking

1:17:42.790,1:17:49.32,my favorite class ever I mean three by I

1:17:45.940,1:17:55.48,mean just by miles and miles

1:17:49.320,1:17:56.73,good I'm glad to work people but I mean

1:17:55.480,1:17:58.23,I guess but I mean true I mean though

1:17:56.739,1:18:01.21,that I mean it is in a sense a very

1:17:58.239,1:18:03.19,democratic operative and I guess I can

1:18:01.210,1:18:07.63,see that this is your relationship to it

1:18:03.190,1:18:11.57,in that way I guess it will be left for

1:18:07.630,1:18:11.57,others to comment on how it may have

1:18:11.849,1:18:20.21,okay well thank you very much but so

1:18:14.559,1:18:20.21,good you're so good at this I really are

1:18:25.260,1:18:36.19,so yeah so I'd like to take some photos

1:18:33.130,1:18:38.05,of your kind of organization and maybe

1:18:36.190,1:18:40.61,if we can show those index cards and

1:18:38.050,1:18:40.61,stuff like that
