start,end,line
0:00:00.030,0:00:10.620,well and right there and that one that
0:00:09.059,0:00:13.110,has like an auto level so that should
0:00:10.620,0:00:14.429,work and I can see it so that's nice
0:00:13.110,0:00:18.660,usually usually I get really nervous
0:00:14.429,0:00:20.730,about 30 minutes in is it going and one
0:00:18.660,0:00:24.140,time one wasn't going which really made
0:00:20.730,0:00:27.689,me anxious but I got is why I have to
0:00:24.140,0:00:29.519,yeah these are the questions and it's
0:00:27.689,0:00:32.040,pretty open-ended and all there's sort
0:00:29.519,0:00:34.559,of a couple parts to it the first part
0:00:32.040,0:00:36.210,is is the very sort of meant to be
0:00:34.559,0:00:39.090,quickly going through your current
0:00:36.210,0:00:40.500,practices for your digital files it's a
0:00:39.090,0:00:42.719,survey that I did with that I've done
0:00:40.500,0:00:44.850,online with a bunch of emerging writers
0:00:42.719,0:00:47.460,and I'm asking all these all the
0:00:44.850,0:00:49.440,participants and this as well and then
0:00:47.460,0:00:50.850,we'll talk kind of specifically about
0:00:49.440,0:00:52.410,your writing processes for the problem
0:00:50.850,0:00:54.239,the majority and then there's there's
0:00:52.410,0:00:56.460,questions about computing and computers
0:00:54.239,0:00:58.469,and usually I don't usually we cover
0:00:56.460,0:00:59.699,those but sometimes like I go through
0:00:58.469,0:01:02.399,those a little bit too if we've gone
0:00:59.699,0:01:04.710,through things and I want to ask a few
0:01:02.399,0:01:07.130,more that's not okay do you need do you
0:01:04.710,0:01:10.500,have to go somewhere or anything okay
0:01:07.130,0:01:15.030,well yeah everyone has been hour and 15
0:01:10.500,0:01:16.799,hour and 45 right in there so so if you
0:01:15.030,0:01:18.950,would please state for the recording
0:01:16.799,0:01:22.790,devices your name in our location
0:01:18.950,0:01:25.049,Stephanie Strickland New York City okay
0:01:22.790,0:01:26.729,so in this section I asked what you
0:01:25.049,0:01:28.200,write and what you use to write it and
0:01:26.729,0:01:32.579,this is about how you can post currently
0:01:28.200,0:01:35.880,so what genre is do you write in do
0:01:32.579,0:01:38.100,books of poetry and I write critical
0:01:35.880,0:01:41.400,essays and I write
0:01:38.100,0:01:44.220,or and I make usually collaboratively
0:01:41.400,0:01:48.450,born-digital works okay and would you
0:01:44.220,0:01:50.310,say you have a primary genre what kind
0:01:48.450,0:02:03.440,of devices do you own or have access to
0:01:50.310,0:02:12.840,for your writing pens pencils okay I
0:02:03.440,0:02:16.170,keep an old XP machine I I like to Word
0:02:12.840,0:02:19.650
2003 I managed to get that in Word 2007
0:02:16.170,0:02:25.800,on that let's see okay and then I have a
0:02:19.650,0:02:27.780,little small which it's actually
0:02:25.800,0:02:30.150,probably most advanced I'm but again
0:02:27.780,0:02:34.230,it's Word 2007 is on there that I write
0:02:30.150,0:02:36.810,with and it's um for travel and then
0:02:34.230,0:02:41.180,since the last thing I made was a app
0:02:36.810,0:02:41.180,for iPad I was forced to buy an iPad
0:02:41.570,0:02:49.230,yeah mini a mini that's what I have but
0:02:47.280,0:02:53.250,I do that right you don't write on it
0:02:49.230,0:02:55.260,right now okay um and so you
0:02:53.250,0:03:02.100,and so the your the operating systems
0:02:55.260,0:03:03.810,you're using our mostly Windows okay do
0:03:02.100,0:03:05.880,you work on the different devices and
0:03:03.810,0:03:07.140,how do you work between like I guess if
0:03:05.880,0:03:10.200,we have all these devices what's your
0:03:07.140,0:03:12.700,sort of style for going between them I
0:03:10.200,0:03:15.230,[Music]
0:03:12.700,0:03:16.490,well if I'm generating new material I
0:03:15.230,0:03:17.840,will certainly do a certain amount of
0:03:16.490,0:03:23.959,writing by hand
0:03:17.840,0:03:25.850,you know I capture at various points of
0:03:23.959,0:03:29.750,the material in a word processing
0:03:25.850,0:03:33.410,program the the one I work with most
0:03:29.750,0:03:35.030,intuitively is Word 2003 I'm annoyed it
0:03:33.410,0:03:38.120,all have fun yeah
0:03:35.030,0:03:40.610,extra ridiculous functionality at least
0:03:38.120,0:03:43.970,there's no Clippy right yeah I mean
0:03:40.610,0:03:46.010,there's too much it's not directed you
0:03:43.970,0:03:47.330,know for what I wanted yeah and it
0:03:46.010,0:03:48.980,doesn't handle other things like
0:03:47.330,0:03:52.480,Photoshop would that you know that it
0:03:48.980,0:03:55.519,says that it will yeah um but
0:03:52.480,0:03:57.530,nonetheless it it's not supported
0:03:55.519,0:04:01.970,anymore it's with so much of the
0:03:57.530,0:04:03.590,software that I once used yeah so I yeah
0:04:01.970,0:04:06.680,I captured a different point certainly
0:04:03.590,0:04:08.390,capturing it online it's much better for
0:04:06.680,0:04:12.350,sharing it mm-hmm
0:04:08.390,0:04:15.400,and editing it to a degree but it's not
0:04:12.350,0:04:18.440,particularly good for it through one
0:04:15.400,0:04:19.940,what do you mean by well if you writing
0:04:18.440,0:04:22.450,something long whether the complex
0:04:19.940,0:04:24.950,argument I think it's much easier to
0:04:22.450,0:04:29.510,have it in front of human paper and read
0:04:24.950,0:04:33.169,it out yeah because it's very easy to go
0:04:29.510,0:04:34.310,into a collage II kind of style of stuff
0:04:33.169,0:04:37.250,with stuff that's gonna be published
0:04:34.310,0:04:40.250,online you know it's harder to get a
0:04:37.250,0:04:44.120,really consecutive long consecutive
0:04:40.250,0:04:49.250,argument made I think yeah
0:04:44.120,0:04:51.800,and it's not fluid enough to do poetry I
0:04:49.250,0:04:53.240,mean it restricts you way too much in
0:04:51.800,0:04:56.090,terms of formatting compared to what you
0:04:53.240,0:04:57.920,can do on a page by hand yeah in terms
0:04:56.090,0:04:59.630,of how you wanna scratch things out or
0:04:57.920,0:05:07.520,put something right in there's no arrow
0:04:59.630,0:05:09.830,insert right right so it's neither so
0:05:07.520,0:05:11.810,it's so there's a loss from both
0:05:09.830,0:05:15.680,perspectives but obviously from the
0:05:11.810,0:05:21.260,point of organizing it and and sharing
0:05:15.680,0:05:22.970,it and missus airily sending it on for
0:05:21.260,0:05:27.650,publishing these days and everything it
0:05:22.970,0:05:29.000,has to be done in there took me a long
0:05:27.650,0:05:30.860,time to get there though because I
0:05:29.000,0:05:32.810,started on a manual typewriter and then
0:05:30.860,0:05:40.940,getting an IBM typewriter was a big
0:05:32.810,0:05:42.290,thing yes yeah no I think that's I mean
0:05:40.940,0:05:44.720,that's really the impetus for this it's
0:05:42.290,0:05:46.040,just I was just thinking about the thing
0:05:44.720,0:05:47.810,I did earlier then I started thinking
0:05:46.040,0:05:49.880,about you know the writers who like you
0:05:47.810,0:05:51.680,yourself have been writing over this of
0:05:49.880,0:05:54.530,course this is a very interesting time
0:05:51.680,0:05:56.750,for writing I mean there's little balls
0:05:54.530,0:05:59.180,on the IBM Selectric that was like this
0:05:56.750,0:06:01.580,huge thing oh yeah that you could erase
0:05:59.180,0:06:03.020,with uh any raised thing I mean you
0:06:01.580,0:06:05.150,don't have to pull the page out and
0:06:03.020,0:06:08.000,start all over again the other day there
0:06:05.150,0:06:10.550,was a disappointed by that that was so
0:06:08.000,0:06:12.260,each technology actually gave rise to a
0:06:10.550,0:06:14.180,certain kind of poetry and a certain
0:06:12.260,0:06:15.979,kind of mistake I mean there's a
0:06:14.180,0:06:17.930,characteristic mistakes people make an
0:06:15.979,0:06:20.280,email or substance characteristic word
0:06:17.930,0:06:24.300,substitutions they do they know
0:06:20.280,0:06:25.950,the page and anyway so I don't think
0:06:24.300,0:06:28.290,that story has really been told
0:06:25.950,0:06:30.180,yeah because it shifts so rapidly
0:06:28.290,0:06:32.190,because you went from email to texting
0:06:30.180,0:06:33.480,to this to that you know and each one of
0:06:32.190,0:06:35.639,those things has a different ending
0:06:33.480,0:06:38.820,Facebook sits up there and shifts its
0:06:35.639,0:06:41.760,yeah it interface like monthly or way
0:06:38.820,0:06:43.320,right that's right so and that gives
0:06:41.760,0:06:45.270,rise to a whole new thinking in the
0:06:43.320,0:06:47.280,meantime whatever a person might have
0:06:45.270,0:06:49.310,wanted to do is kind of knocked out of
0:06:47.280,0:06:52.980,their head because here's the left
0:06:49.310,0:06:55.740,wrestling clip yeah interface yeah no I
0:06:52.980,0:07:02.850,mean that's a good point
0:06:55.740,0:07:05.160,um so in terms of like going between
0:07:02.850,0:07:09.770,your paperwork and your and going to the
0:07:05.160,0:07:09.770,digital look what are those what steps
0:07:12.919,0:07:18.750,like if I'm writing a pic like I'm doing
0:07:15.660,0:07:20.100,a conference presentation there was a
0:07:18.750,0:07:21.510,couple of conferences we're gonna do
0:07:20.100,0:07:22.860,something with so I would tend to
0:07:21.510,0:07:25.440,generate something and send it to my
0:07:22.860,0:07:27.210,partner what do they want to say about
0:07:25.440,0:07:29.030,it you know I know we get together face
0:07:27.210,0:07:32.940,to face and deal with it or whatever
0:07:29.030,0:07:36.140,like the last really big new book I did
0:07:32.940,0:07:41.630,driver logic the way I wrote that was
0:07:36.140,0:07:43.849,for probably six months every morning I
0:07:41.630,0:07:45.889,had some
0:07:43.849,0:07:47.629,paper notebooks and things I was looking
0:07:45.889,0:07:50.089,through old notes and things and I would
0:07:47.629,0:07:52.249,said I would write every morning for
0:07:50.089,0:07:54.709,maybe three or four hours and at the end
0:07:52.249,0:07:56.869,of the morning I would go and type it up
0:07:54.709,0:07:59.809,I mean in play uh-huh
0:07:56.869,0:08:01.789,I did not look at it again the next day
0:07:59.809,0:08:05.689,would start completely fresh and I did
0:08:01.789,0:08:10.669,that to the point that had no idea how
0:08:05.689,0:08:12.709,it begun yeah so he and some maybe six
0:08:10.669,0:08:15.259,months later I sort of came to the end
0:08:12.709,0:08:19.429,of that mm-hmm and then was a matter of
0:08:15.259,0:08:21.769,looking back and like what am i what is
0:08:19.429,0:08:29.719,it you know and so there was a long
0:08:21.769,0:08:31.699,period of making a unity of some kind
0:08:29.719,0:08:34.459,out of it and that shifted that had me
0:08:31.699,0:08:37.069,maybe two or three major shifts an
0:08:34.459,0:08:38.509,understanding no as I go through it but
0:08:37.069,0:08:40.039,I really liked it because it was very
0:08:38.509,0:08:43.669,new to me to go back and look at I mean
0:08:40.039,0:08:46.639,really it really had no you didn't yeah
0:08:43.669,0:08:49.610,yeah so there was a long period of
0:08:46.639,0:08:52.279,writing and sometimes I've gone to write
0:08:49.610,0:08:54.170,it write in colonies and and written
0:08:52.279,0:08:58.069,straight through for a long long long
0:08:54.170,0:08:59.420,time in that I didn't put it till I came
0:08:58.069,0:09:01.759,back from there but then there was a
0:08:59.420,0:09:03.439,time when you would they still had a car
0:09:01.759,0:09:06.079,at that time I wasn't living in the city
0:09:03.439,0:09:08.750,mm-hmm and I put my IBM Selectric or
0:09:06.079,0:09:10.459,whatever you know and then every time or
0:09:08.750,0:09:13.730,and then there was I would rent a
0:09:10.459,0:09:15.949,computer Oh to have at that place
0:09:13.730,0:09:18.769,because I wanted to print it yeah and
0:09:15.949,0:09:20.899,then I still want the printer I still it
0:09:18.769,0:09:22.730,looks different to me on paper than it
0:09:20.899,0:09:25.490,does on the screen yeah I wanna know
0:09:22.730,0:09:27.649,both those aspects and then there came
0:09:25.490,0:09:30.860,the time when no one did that anymore
0:09:27.649,0:09:32.720,you couldn't really rent a computer or
0:09:30.860,0:09:33.279,rented and there was the same time that
0:09:32.720,0:09:34.689,you
0:09:33.279,0:09:37.360,go to make presentations wherever you
0:09:34.689,0:09:40.420,went the university had a computer there
0:09:37.360,0:09:42.189,in a room with the stage and you know
0:09:40.420,0:09:43.689,when you needed a technician to come and
0:09:42.189,0:09:45.550,fix up all the way you know right and
0:09:43.689,0:09:47.350,then they didn't anymore because
0:09:45.550,0:09:49.420,everyone was expected to bring their
0:09:47.350,0:09:50.199,laptop and to have one and travel with
0:09:49.420,0:09:52.350,it right
0:09:50.199,0:09:54.579,I had a lot of problems with my hands
0:09:52.350,0:09:58.269,from what if we started doing digital
0:09:54.579,0:09:59.860,work and I try I travel really really
0:09:58.269,0:10:02.139,light so that made me really angry that
0:09:59.860,0:10:03.459,I I'm sure you don't have to get you
0:10:02.139,0:10:05.529,know yeah wouldn't that would borrow
0:10:03.459,0:10:08.649,somebody's or something like that so
0:10:05.529,0:10:10.749,there's like all these phases of of what
0:10:08.649,0:10:12.309,you had to do or the way to do it so it
0:10:10.749,0:10:15.519,was different for everybody when you're
0:10:12.309,0:10:18.309,when you're working like like for for
0:10:15.519,0:10:20.110,dragon logic when you were working on
0:10:18.309,0:10:22.180,paper in the mornings what were you
0:10:20.110,0:10:25.589,working on what were your materials was
0:10:22.180,0:10:25.589,it just was it like that notebook and
0:10:28.230,0:10:32.250,okay
0:10:29.390,0:10:36.370,[Music]
0:10:32.250,0:10:42.630,a pen with
0:10:36.370,0:10:45.220,wedding okay you know when ish yeah yeah
0:10:42.630,0:10:48.550,there has a flow to it begin because of
0:10:45.220,0:10:50.680,my hands okay to have the lease mmm
0:10:48.550,0:10:56.140,Alfred Oh writing
0:10:50.680,0:10:58.990,I like big I like like engineering
0:10:56.140,0:11:02.230,notebook with graph paper okay things
0:10:58.990,0:11:05.800,yes like often bigger ones like this and
0:11:02.230,0:11:13.690,it was like a green green grass uh-huh
0:11:05.800,0:11:16.390,yeah I don't like just lined pages like
0:11:13.690,0:11:19.210,this makes an overall page better yeah
0:11:16.390,0:11:21.150,but feels more like volume to it and
0:11:19.210,0:11:28.300,that I mean that book has such
0:11:21.150,0:11:29.740,interesting value so then how do you so
0:11:28.300,0:11:31.180,then you how do you save that stuff do
0:11:29.740,0:11:32.770,you just keep it and once you're
0:11:31.180,0:11:36.850,finished with the notebook do you store
0:11:32.770,0:11:39.400,it somewhere or you send it put it in a
0:11:36.850,0:11:41.529,box over there but most of your
0:11:39.400,0:11:43.360,prewriting and your notes are all in
0:11:41.529,0:11:52.089,notebooks like that I mean for it for
0:11:43.360,0:11:57.220,out it can be anything because it's
0:11:52.089,0:11:59.650,whatever I am right it can be stuff I
0:11:57.220,0:12:01.480,wrote down at different times and it
0:11:59.650,0:12:04.420,happened to bring it together and and
0:12:01.480,0:12:06.130,then there was so many versions for
0:12:04.420,0:12:07.740,awhile I mean then you sort of drown in
0:12:06.130,0:12:09.650,versions and then I get tired of that
0:12:07.740,0:12:14.810,thanking the time
0:12:09.650,0:12:20.450,is that it I needed to use the back of
0:12:14.810,0:12:24.140,everything okay for ecological reasons
0:12:20.450,0:12:27.710,okay and and I really feel sorry for the
0:12:24.140,0:12:28.940,people that do because now there's the
0:12:27.710,0:12:30.620,subversion of the thing and you look on
0:12:28.940,0:12:32.300,the back and you have no idea when that
0:12:30.620,0:12:34.010,thing in the back I mean if you think
0:12:32.300,0:12:37.490,the front and back were done at the same
0:12:34.010,0:12:41.900,time they know looks good now we have
0:12:37.490,0:12:43.250,that unrest and they have no relation to
0:12:41.900,0:12:49.400,each other but I can just see somebody
0:12:43.250,0:12:51.800,sick yeah and the other thing I do
0:12:49.400,0:12:54.170,that's crazy and said I have some
0:12:51.800,0:12:56.290,notebooks and then sometimes I go
0:12:54.170,0:12:59.420,through the exact same notebook again
0:12:56.290,0:13:02.930,mm-hmm and right into it
0:12:59.420,0:13:05.660,oh so that it's it's actually a pound
0:13:02.930,0:13:07.190,sensitive to different yeah things that
0:13:05.660,0:13:09.800,happen and there's no way that you would
0:13:07.190,0:13:12.500,know right from the outside and so why
0:13:09.800,0:13:14.839,do you do that what's because I want to
0:13:12.500,0:13:17.510,I go back and Cesar still this doesn't
0:13:14.839,0:13:19.250,still have the pull for me that it did
0:13:17.510,0:13:20.870,the things that I wrote down at that
0:13:19.250,0:13:25.339,time because there's things that tend to
0:13:20.870,0:13:27.589,be continually magnetizing from him you
0:13:25.339,0:13:29.959,know and I like to see like like I've
0:13:27.589,0:13:34.220,never kept a diary in the sense of a
0:13:29.959,0:13:35.350,personal diary or like a diary of what
0:13:34.220,0:13:39.560,happened with my kids
0:13:35.350,0:13:41.959,yeah you know whatever I've never done
0:13:39.560,0:13:48.970,that kind of a thing mhm I have like a
0:13:41.959,0:13:51.980,horror of that like a half horse but I
0:13:48.970,0:13:53.990,but I but there's just sometimes it just
0:13:51.980,0:13:56.600,as something just gets to me and I just
0:13:53.990,0:13:58.850,need to bring it down so it's like it's
0:13:56.600,0:14:00.200,so much it's just this magnetizing thing
0:13:58.850,0:14:03.890,sort of right mm-hmm
0:14:00.200,0:14:07.280,so or you know maybe some image or
0:14:03.890,0:14:11.900,something that came back yeah there's
0:14:07.280,0:14:16.760,like I remember seeing once an image of
0:14:11.900,0:14:18.830,a Viking boat that I actually didn't
0:14:16.760,0:14:20.510,want things to go get to see your Norway
0:14:18.830,0:14:23.510,but if this was just on that cover of a
0:14:20.510,0:14:24.980,thing and it was the keel and the shape
0:14:23.510,0:14:26.570,of the thing and it was just doing the
0:14:24.980,0:14:30.050,kind of turquoise mm-hm
0:14:26.570,0:14:34.700,it was like I'm like you know like it
0:14:30.050,0:14:36.260,could have been like a company's annual
0:14:34.700,0:14:37.970,report or something was on the cover I
0:14:36.260,0:14:39.860,had nothing to do with what was in there
0:14:37.970,0:14:43.100,right yeah but this just image it's just
0:14:39.860,0:14:45.230,like you know there's iliyan ways you
0:14:43.100,0:14:47.090,know that yeah was important to me that
0:14:45.230,0:14:49.730,I don't necessarily know how do you know
0:14:47.090,0:14:55.610,so I have pictures pulled off like that
0:14:49.730,0:15:01.430,and no it's not organized okay good luck
0:14:55.610,0:15:04.730,future research so it sounds like you
0:15:01.430,0:15:07.340,kind of right so how did how does the I
0:15:04.730,0:15:08.930,mean dragon logic isn't really I mean it
0:15:07.340,0:15:10.790,is an individual works it is a
0:15:08.930,0:15:12.350,collection but it's also kind of you
0:15:10.790,0:15:14.210,know and you know some of your other
0:15:12.350,0:15:16.610,books as well kind of you know art cult
0:15:14.210,0:15:19.160,not quite like made of individual work
0:15:16.610,0:15:20.660,so but then do you when you're working
0:15:19.160,0:15:29.140,then when you move stuff over to the
0:15:20.660,0:15:31.580,computer do you see yeah right right
0:15:29.140,0:15:33.200,yeah and it just sounds like with your
0:15:31.580,0:15:34.940,notebooks in it I'm just interested in
0:15:33.200,0:15:36.500,how then like how do you organize that
0:15:34.940,0:15:38.080,once it once it moves on to a digital
0:15:36.500,0:15:39.850,space I'm really good
0:15:38.080,0:15:43.090,do that for lots of other people's books
0:15:39.850,0:15:44.650,too Unity's I see structures I think I
0:15:43.090,0:15:47.230,think instructors I wanted to be an
0:15:44.650,0:15:52.510,architect at one time to make sense and
0:15:47.230,0:15:54.310,I so do you know the sort of math side
0:15:52.510,0:15:55.600,of things and beautiful side of things
0:15:54.310,0:15:58.360,right right
0:15:55.600,0:16:00.820,I'm not different for me exactly so that
0:15:58.360,0:16:03.100,this structure is often what I see do
0:16:00.820,0:16:05.140,you know yes what it resonate there's
0:16:03.100,0:16:07.480,kind of some kind of resonance here so I
0:16:05.140,0:16:11.110,see that and then it becomes what's the
0:16:07.480,0:16:14.650,best way in mm-hmm but that's for print
0:16:11.110,0:16:16.660,because then in a digital work very good
0:16:14.650,0:16:18.850,meaning the same way right yeah there
0:16:16.660,0:16:19.930,was an excess off into all parts of it
0:16:18.850,0:16:22.360,at once
0:16:19.930,0:16:25.840,mhm you know in some kinds and though I
0:16:22.360,0:16:29.980,generally provide a default path through
0:16:25.840,0:16:31.120,as well as that yeah so and I think
0:16:29.980,0:16:32.740,that's probably why that kind of work
0:16:31.120,0:16:35.500,was so interesting to me because it's
0:16:32.740,0:16:38.980,specially I think starting with to North
0:16:35.500,0:16:41.500,which has closed five and Interpol the
0:16:38.980,0:16:44.380,public ones itself I sort of used to
0:16:41.500,0:16:46.660,divide up the yeah but but really
0:16:44.380,0:16:50.440,they're supposed to be at the center
0:16:46.660,0:16:56.080,yeah you know like the Sun going around
0:16:50.440,0:16:58.120,do me so that one question and then the
0:16:56.080,0:17:00.970,rest of the things would be around in
0:16:58.120,0:17:07.140,this sort of spherical space like really
0:17:00.970,0:17:07.140,should be an installation yeah yeah
0:17:08.280,0:17:15.580,someday they'll be hologram yeah yeah so
0:17:13.810,0:17:17.290,and then just in terms of the
0:17:15.580,0:17:18.850,nitty-gritty though I mean like when you
0:17:17.290,0:17:21.280,have a file on the computer
0:17:18.850,0:17:24.480,yeah what's it called like is it called
0:17:21.280,0:17:27.000,an a title of the poem is it
0:17:24.480,0:17:31.080,or is it do you have large files full of
0:17:27.000,0:17:35.429,full of many things well at some point
0:17:31.080,0:17:36.870,it's the name of the poem or it's a name
0:17:35.429,0:17:41.870,that references the name of the poem
0:17:36.870,0:17:44.340,mm-hmm and I for a long time I will do
0:17:41.870,0:17:45.779,revisions within that file with the date
0:17:44.340,0:17:49.610,at the top okay
0:17:45.779,0:17:51.840,of what which revision that is mm-hmm so
0:17:49.610,0:17:53.700,sometimes when I'm doing many many
0:17:51.840,0:17:54.360,revisions in one day that gets a little
0:17:53.700,0:17:57.779,lost
0:17:54.360,0:18:00.570,mhm then at the point of a manuscript
0:17:57.779,0:18:06.269,there's a whole file that's the entire
0:18:00.570,0:18:09.929,manuscript okay and those will have days
0:18:06.269,0:18:11.970,or some you know called one two three
0:18:09.929,0:18:13.980,years now I mean they'd be distinguished
0:18:11.970,0:18:15.929,in some kind of stowage version they are
0:18:13.980,0:18:19.980,of the whole manuscript
0:18:15.929,0:18:22.529,I don't put I don't just put a whole lot
0:18:19.980,0:18:24.870,of stuff together I mean it doesn't
0:18:22.529,0:18:27.720,belong together right in one file I you
0:18:24.870,0:18:29.370,know I have kind of an elaborate folder
0:18:27.720,0:18:31.980,system okay
0:18:29.370,0:18:35.490,which family worked in my res I'm pretty
0:18:31.980,0:18:40.350,comfortable you know yeah and so I know
0:18:35.490,0:18:41.789,where I think but increasingly I like
0:18:40.350,0:18:44.039,where did I put that because there's too
0:18:41.789,0:18:45.990,many places to put it certain things
0:18:44.039,0:18:47.429,right is it the conference that I'm
0:18:45.990,0:18:49.139,gonna give it to and your essays and
0:18:47.429,0:18:54.210,talks isn't under weight or whatever
0:18:49.139,0:19:02.630,yeah and the search capability within
0:18:54.210,0:19:02.630,windows aesthetic yeah so not better
0:19:02.690,0:19:08.509,yeah the one that is well acquainted
0:19:06.289,0:19:11.929,with them so I you know that's a little
0:19:08.509,0:19:14.479,annoying that I can't face yeah I mean
0:19:11.929,0:19:17.029,Google you know I tried to find the
0:19:14.479,0:19:21.559,other book called the burn book no by
0:19:17.029,0:19:24.789,mark mark - something Wow
0:19:21.559,0:19:27.859,can't what
0:19:24.789,0:19:31.609,anyway the let I thought it was kidding
0:19:27.859,0:19:34.909,I had oh you a K right I had mark right
0:19:31.609,0:19:37.609,I had burn right named dictor and go on
0:19:34.909,0:19:40.720,Amazon going books a French talk I mean
0:19:37.609,0:19:45.919,you know she wished it whatever yeah
0:19:40.720,0:19:48.859,could not find it right I think and I
0:19:45.919,0:19:51.200,had it didn't make what I thought was an
0:19:48.859,0:19:55.759,obvious gentleman I usually yeah did you
0:19:51.200,0:19:57.859,mean yeah no anyway I finally got it and
0:19:55.759,0:20:00.529,being after trying silly and different
0:19:57.859,0:20:02.389,things but I mean no like it should be
0:20:00.529,0:20:04.099,better by now that kind of thing should
0:20:02.389,0:20:06.609,be wait better by now yeah yeah
0:20:04.099,0:20:13.099,published book should be just pop right
0:20:06.609,0:20:19.629,yeah so I know I'm not happy with search
0:20:13.099,0:20:19.629,okay in general and as a library
0:20:20.409,0:20:27.109,problems with it so once it once it's so
0:20:25.489,0:20:28.669,just to be clear like when you're doing
0:20:27.109,0:20:30.799,an individual poem and you put the date
0:20:28.669,0:20:33.619,at the top do you have like a version
0:20:30.799,0:20:36.309,and then another version at another page
0:20:33.619,0:20:41.239,with the new date or something like that
0:20:36.309,0:20:43.849,but it's one okay increasingly you're
0:20:41.239,0:20:48.900,further away from the what and then and
0:20:43.849,0:20:51.200,then you know you just what use will is
0:20:48.900,0:20:53.370,often a version really really beginning
0:20:51.200,0:20:57.570,mm man you take something from the
0:20:53.370,0:21:06.330,middle yeah and then you can find your
0:20:57.570,0:21:09.330,way yeah I do it like that or and then
0:21:06.330,0:21:11.220,eventually it's like what you need to
0:21:09.330,0:21:14.640,call final version or the version sent
0:21:11.220,0:21:18.720,to so-and-so or the mm-hmm you know like
0:21:14.640,0:21:20.940,that the trains have clean copy folder
0:21:18.720,0:21:22.649,as well as they'll work so that okay so
0:21:20.940,0:21:23.820,you have the kind of the working draft
0:21:22.649,0:21:26.390,and then you can push it into a
0:21:23.820,0:21:28.230,different folder that's more finalized
0:21:26.390,0:21:32.279,okay
0:21:28.230,0:21:35.309,and during this time are you printing
0:21:32.279,0:21:39.000,out those to revise them as well well
0:21:35.309,0:21:40.590,you print them out not you know
0:21:39.000,0:21:45.029,everything in a certain point you'll
0:21:40.590,0:21:46.440,print it out yeah yeah yeah do you save
0:21:45.029,0:21:59.669,any of the paper copies of those
0:21:46.440,0:22:01.320,printouts yeah because in this thing of
0:21:59.669,0:22:04.289,going back to the notebooks of things
0:22:01.320,0:22:09.919,and what you do know is mm yeah things
0:22:04.289,0:22:12.750,like the galleries and things like that
0:22:09.919,0:22:15.120,and sometimes it just seems crazy if
0:22:12.750,0:22:20.520,it's just too many versions and those
0:22:15.120,0:22:22.549,all from before we're all pretty yeah so
0:22:20.520,0:22:22.549,I
0:22:22.940,0:22:32.610,oh man that's gonna be fun so how did
0:22:30.149,0:22:34.649,you how did you develop your your sort
0:22:32.610,0:22:36.600,of writing style and I mean that sort of
0:22:34.649,0:22:38.640,revision style on the computer did that
0:22:36.600,0:22:40.049,just I mean did you start out on the
0:22:38.640,0:22:44.370,computer doing it like that er I mean
0:22:40.049,0:22:45.630,how has it grown into doing that
0:22:44.370,0:22:47.880,it was always like that I mean I was
0:22:45.630,0:22:51.059,extremely aware of where we're with
0:22:47.880,0:22:52.710,every shift in software every certain
0:22:51.059,0:22:54.419,functionality and makes it kind of hits
0:22:52.710,0:22:56.580,me yeah what I've lost
0:22:54.419,0:23:02.309,you know what I've gained of anything we
0:22:56.580,0:23:03.840,mean and so I always need to just see it
0:23:02.309,0:23:08.659,both ways so I think from the beginning
0:23:03.840,0:23:10.529,I printed it out and I yeah and then yes
0:23:08.659,0:23:12.630,from the time I had trouble with my
0:23:10.529,0:23:21.059,hands which was 1995 when I first
0:23:12.630,0:23:39.059,started using a story space that erased
0:23:21.059,0:23:41.640,all your links every 11th anyway um so I
0:23:39.059,0:23:45.120,wanted to I couldn't keep doing I
0:23:41.640,0:23:47.399,couldn't keep yeah working yeah you know
0:23:45.120,0:23:49.409,and so there's a whole period of
0:23:47.399,0:23:52.409,becoming a little more ergonomically
0:23:49.409,0:23:54.029,aware working with computers and they've
0:23:52.409,0:23:56.090,changed so much
0:23:54.029,0:23:58.659,do you know and
0:23:56.090,0:24:01.159,so you know as many different ways as
0:23:58.659,0:24:03.619,possible you know shift off to use
0:24:01.159,0:24:05.419,different yeah you know your eyes get
0:24:03.619,0:24:09.799,really tired of being on a computer or
0:24:05.419,0:24:11.690,your hand brake and then currently are
0:24:09.799,0:24:18.729,you back how are you backing up here
0:24:11.690,0:24:22.190,your work I try to make that the main
0:24:18.729,0:24:24.769,thing uh-huh and you back that up onto a
0:24:22.190,0:24:30.229,flash drive okay and then I have this
0:24:24.769,0:24:32.839,sink toy stuff that Microsoft makes for
0:24:30.229,0:24:34.489,its computers mm-hmm that on there and
0:24:32.839,0:24:40.749,so I think that meant to there that
0:24:34.489,0:24:43.729,works okay yeah uh-huh that I try to put
0:24:40.749,0:24:45.499,from there onto that that doesn't work
0:24:43.729,0:24:47.089,is what was working fine and now they
0:24:45.499,0:24:49.009,just updated so I'm having trouble with
0:24:47.089,0:24:53.299,that at the moment yeah actually I'm
0:24:49.009,0:24:59.749,that sort of works so it's on there in
0:24:53.299,0:25:02.029,there in there and then the Easter I
0:24:59.749,0:25:04.849,just kind of put the files on that I
0:25:02.029,0:25:06.049,like I mean one big copy from there but
0:25:04.849,0:25:08.570,I don't really keep it updated and
0:25:06.049,0:25:11.260,anything I mean cuz it's just the files
0:25:08.570,0:25:13.820,that really need to work with them
0:25:11.260,0:25:15.380,are there any sort of standard I mean
0:25:13.820,0:25:16.760,are you like backing up like every five
0:25:15.380,0:25:18.110,months or something is there sort of
0:25:16.760,0:25:27.559,regularity to it or is the sort of thing
0:25:18.110,0:25:31.460,I when I listed a nightstick they do it
0:25:27.559,0:25:33.530,at least every two weeks but I if I did
0:25:31.460,0:25:34.880,a lot of work I would do it I mean you
0:25:33.530,0:25:37.160,know there there's a whole lot of stuff
0:25:34.880,0:25:40.070,that I yeah earlier or something or you
0:25:37.160,0:25:41.720,know and it'll be and if I'm doing that
0:25:40.070,0:25:44.090,it'll kind of be on the flash drives
0:25:41.720,0:25:46.220,between the computers as I move you like
0:25:44.090,0:25:47.929,to work on it here yeah
0:25:46.220,0:25:49.790,do you ever email it to yourself or
0:25:47.929,0:25:51.470,anything like that inter if you look up
0:25:49.790,0:26:08.360,maybe like a copy of the recent
0:25:51.470,0:26:08.840,manuscript so that was like the zip
0:26:08.360,0:26:11.929,drives
0:26:08.840,0:26:14.300,yeah just used to be yeah thousand ways
0:26:11.929,0:26:16.190,yeah I went on this trip I went and
0:26:14.300,0:26:17.960,visited the bike Ian and met with there
0:26:16.190,0:26:19.610,born digital archivist
0:26:17.960,0:26:21.620,and like they have us like a computer
0:26:19.610,0:26:22.760,stack with all the different old things
0:26:21.620,0:26:24.200,that slide in they've built it
0:26:22.760,0:26:26.600,themselves it's really kind of cool to
0:26:24.200,0:26:29.980,see and I mean I'll do all that forensic
0:26:26.600,0:26:34.220,material to look at those things yeah
0:26:29.980,0:26:43.040,what what about your your older media
0:26:34.220,0:26:44.900,they just I just it was just such a so
0:26:43.040,0:26:48.170,much to come between you and your work
0:26:44.900,0:26:50.140,yeah and then I mean when I first
0:26:48.170,0:26:52.040,started working collaborating with
0:26:50.140,0:26:54.700,Marjorie Lister bring you know she was
0:26:52.040,0:26:57.660,using to look I mean people had me know
0:26:54.700,0:27:00.580,yeah I mean you know and
0:26:57.660,0:27:01.360,each new version of the software would
0:27:00.580,0:27:03.120,be worse
0:27:01.360,0:27:06.550,do you know I mean it was more
0:27:03.120,0:27:09.400,functionality in the beginning right and
0:27:06.550,0:27:12.580,then they would just knock it down so
0:27:09.400,0:27:14.770,then those of us who use director and
0:27:12.580,0:27:17.890,flash and oh yeah you know that we've
0:27:14.770,0:27:20.470,been hit hard yeah watch especially well
0:27:17.890,0:27:22.660,what's director shockwave fast
0:27:20.470,0:27:26.410,oh okay fast okay and direct it was
0:27:22.660,0:27:27.820,beautiful directed most the he
0:27:26.410,0:27:30.130,literature pieces that I like the best
0:27:27.820,0:27:32.830,remaining director so it's that sort of
0:27:30.130,0:27:34.810,like you're sort of ideal software
0:27:32.830,0:27:36.940,environment well it was you know you
0:27:34.810,0:27:39.790,mean you know it doesn't produce stuff
0:27:36.940,0:27:43.480,for miniature mobile devices right yeah
0:27:39.790,0:27:46.270,right but yes the work that I thought
0:27:43.480,0:27:48.850,was really beautiful was dumbing that
0:27:46.270,0:27:51.280,and and then and Macromedia was fine
0:27:48.850,0:27:55.390,Adobe mmm-hmm when Adobe bought
0:27:51.280,0:27:56.260,Macromedia it didn't between Adobe by
0:27:55.390,0:27:59.530,Macromedia
0:27:56.260,0:28:00.850,and Steve Jobs not and your skin flashes
0:27:59.530,0:28:03.870,of memory hawk and all that when you
0:28:00.850,0:28:06.960,move - yeah but between those two things
0:28:03.870,0:28:09.059,those are very creative things you know
0:28:06.960,0:28:11.700,and yeah and and and they haven't been
0:28:09.059,0:28:14.159,really replaced html5 and JavaScript
0:28:11.700,0:28:17.190,doesn't do it you know all the same way
0:28:14.159,0:28:19.080,and I mean people are trying to do it
0:28:17.190,0:28:24.330,try I mean it's something is all making
0:28:19.080,0:28:27.750,app well just assault yeah yeah you know
0:28:24.330,0:28:32.010,it's so yeah I mean like that whole
0:28:27.750,0:28:35.149,thing just annoys me that it's it's a
0:28:32.010,0:28:39.260,sure under the control of so few
0:28:35.149,0:28:42.330,software I mean so few computer
0:28:39.260,0:28:45.779,companies right you know what you can do
0:28:42.330,0:28:50.010,it's supposed to be done and looking and
0:28:45.779,0:28:52.110,it was such an open tattoo so much to
0:28:50.010,0:28:54.929,explore and so much did get explored and
0:28:52.110,0:28:57.360,has disappeared right because of the
0:28:54.929,0:29:00.270,inability to access that that we lost on
0:28:57.360,0:29:02.309,like a generation of design intelligence
0:29:00.270,0:29:05.520,this way you might even say right yeah
0:29:02.309,0:29:07.140,because people were explained that there
0:29:05.520,0:29:09.149,wasn't enough time for other people to
0:29:07.140,0:29:10.770,see it or think about it ever before the
0:29:09.149,0:29:11.669,thing had shifted and moved on right
0:29:10.770,0:29:13.649,mm-hmm
0:29:11.669,0:29:16.460,so I mean that all made me very annoyed
0:29:13.649,0:29:20.730,yeah and it seemed to me that it would
0:29:16.460,0:29:22.980,nobody cared about the exploratory side
0:29:20.730,0:29:24.539,of it which they should have yeah Google
0:29:22.980,0:29:26.370,Apple may have enough money to care
0:29:24.539,0:29:28.620,about the explosion of it I think so
0:29:26.370,0:29:32.880,Microsoft to do you know yes yes you'd
0:29:28.620,0:29:35.279,be running huge like like IBM did or you
0:29:32.880,0:29:42.570,know like the labs did and they're huge
0:29:35.279,0:29:45.059,exploratory right yeah so I guess one is
0:29:42.570,0:29:47.200,a question from that like what made you
0:29:45.059,0:29:49.390,stick with it
0:29:47.200,0:29:53.890,well it's just the architectural pop I
0:29:49.390,0:29:56.860,mean the possibilities are just so great
0:29:53.890,0:30:03.850,with respect to time and performativity
0:29:56.860,0:30:08.650,and reach and it's an international art
0:30:03.850,0:30:14.560,form the last of which was maybe
0:30:08.650,0:30:19.120,concrete poetry yeah you know and we
0:30:14.560,0:30:21.280,need to communicate the world's problems
0:30:19.120,0:30:24.150,are global yeah I mean whether climate
0:30:21.280,0:30:32.620,logic or poverty or what-have-you right
0:30:24.150,0:30:37.030,water whatever resources survival so you
0:30:32.620,0:30:39.100,need to be you know I can't speak to
0:30:37.030,0:30:43.360,finer be mining I mean you know what I
0:30:39.100,0:30:44.890,mean yeah if you I just think you should
0:30:43.360,0:30:48.670,explore what you care about
0:30:44.890,0:30:50.980,in a medium that will that that does
0:30:48.670,0:30:53.170,have a reach and and there's a
0:30:50.980,0:30:54.970,difficulties with that I mean this
0:30:53.170,0:30:57.490,generator that Nick and I made which was
0:30:54.970,0:31:01.110,translated into polish and I never
0:30:57.490,0:31:03.460,learned more about English or polish or
0:31:01.110,0:31:06.390,computation than trying to translate it
0:31:03.460,0:31:09.130,you know it brings it brings up all the
0:31:06.390,0:31:10.240,brings up aspects of your language you
0:31:09.130,0:31:11.470,never think about because you'd never
0:31:10.240,0:31:15.010,think about how it's different than
0:31:11.470,0:31:16.540,polish for instance right you know yeah
0:31:15.010,0:31:17.800,and then they're trying to read your
0:31:16.540,0:31:20.380,thing and they're trying to read in this
0:31:17.800,0:31:22.030,case to Melville and Dickinson because
0:31:20.380,0:31:24.160,the we're seeing sparked between was
0:31:22.030,0:31:26.740,based on that yeah right and then so
0:31:24.160,0:31:28.300,then they were trying to deal with that
0:31:26.740,0:31:30.880,and this is not a good translation of
0:31:28.300,0:31:33.520,Dickinson polish and then what so how do
0:31:30.880,0:31:36.130,you that you know yeah so it's a really
0:31:33.520,0:31:39.760,intense not only is it
0:31:36.130,0:31:44.740,International but it's a it's a very
0:31:39.760,0:31:47.380,intense investigation and evaluation of
0:31:44.740,0:31:49.660,your basic materials you know what you
0:31:47.380,0:31:51.370,are yeah well you are working with two
0:31:49.660,0:31:52.930,so you get to know your own stuff better
0:31:51.370,0:31:55.300,and you get to know somebody else better
0:31:52.930,0:31:56.830,and I think that's a minimum of what
0:31:55.300,0:32:00.400,we're going to need mm-hmm
0:31:56.830,0:32:02.440,no I think that's really good so when
0:32:00.400,0:32:05.350,did you do the the translation into
0:32:02.440,0:32:07.210,polish wood well we didn't do that these
0:32:05.350,0:32:11.140,two right which people did it well last
0:32:07.210,0:32:14.050,year well it was done by last last year
0:32:11.140,0:32:16.900,Paris in October I guess earlier
0:32:14.050,0:32:19.090,whenever it's September October yellow
0:32:16.900,0:32:22.810,meaning was in Paris okay it was
0:32:19.090,0:32:26.230,presented there uh-huh and um they gave
0:32:22.810,0:32:28.630,a paper on it and we gave a paper on it
0:32:26.230,0:32:37.180,um which will come out in this French
0:32:28.630,0:32:39.700,Journal for me so and they'd been they
0:32:37.180,0:32:40.780,they'd started doing it pretty soon
0:32:39.700,0:32:42.250,after it was published I think they
0:32:40.780,0:32:45.430,started bringing in it I mean you could
0:32:42.250,0:32:48.070,run into one of these guys that I think
0:32:45.430,0:32:50.650,a translation conference in Paris that
0:32:48.070,0:32:52.900,meant that very week and run or whatever
0:32:50.650,0:32:56.380,and so we've been in the works but it
0:32:52.900,0:32:58.060,just was along that was a long email
0:32:56.380,0:32:59.560,exchange but this is the question how
0:32:58.060,0:33:03.250,would you answer it now anything answer
0:32:59.560,0:33:04.780,it oh did they keep the JavaScript
0:33:03.250,0:33:07.660,specifically and then sort of substitute
0:33:04.780,0:33:14.290,words within the the eraser well no they
0:33:07.660,0:33:16.570,meant to do you have to modify that that
0:33:14.290,0:33:19.270,was so interesting you know think the
0:33:16.570,0:33:21.370,code is you know international or
0:33:19.270,0:33:24.469,somebody it's not yeah tonight it's very
0:33:21.370,0:33:28.859,language specific way you know what you
0:33:24.469,0:33:30.839,I don't know that's fascinating so I'd
0:33:28.859,0:33:33.239,like to talk kind of more like a onna on
0:33:30.839,0:33:36.119,a grinders or not grammar but a longer
0:33:33.239,0:33:39.419,scale about your sort of career as a
0:33:36.119,0:33:41.369,writer and if you could kind of describe
0:33:39.419,0:33:43.379,that art like like when did you start
0:33:41.369,0:33:45.599,kind of writing really seriously poetry
0:33:43.379,0:33:47.219,and then how would you know what was
0:33:45.599,0:33:49.830,like the move like from your first books
0:33:47.219,0:33:51.210,into writing born-digital pieces and
0:33:49.830,0:33:53.489,stuff like that if you could just kind
0:33:51.210,0:34:01.200,of give a kind of broad outline of that
0:33:53.489,0:34:02.399,well I was raised my father was an
0:34:01.200,0:34:05.219,engineer uh-huh
0:34:02.399,0:34:09.000,yeah absolutely no use for words this is
0:34:05.219,0:34:12.649,what words were used by con men lawyers
0:34:09.000,0:34:16.619,and advertising men that's it
0:34:12.649,0:34:19.980,and where's the real world right brave
0:34:16.619,0:34:23.010,less reliable and whatever and he could
0:34:19.980,0:34:24.329,build anything or say anything or fix
0:34:23.010,0:34:24.869,anything awareness I was like that
0:34:24.329,0:34:29.730,mm-hmm
0:34:24.869,0:34:31.889,so I didn't though I my grandmother was
0:34:29.730,0:34:34.349,a great reader and so forth and so fight
0:34:31.889,0:34:36.240,and so there was there was that kind of
0:34:34.349,0:34:38.369,thing but what in my education I didn't
0:34:36.240,0:34:40.859,I didn't have any I mean I did a lot of
0:34:38.369,0:34:44.129,literature but there was no point in it
0:34:40.859,0:34:49.679,that I had any creative writing anything
0:34:44.129,0:34:52.379,like that so I and I had I got married
0:34:49.679,0:34:54.299,when I was still in college and I had
0:34:52.379,0:34:55.740,three kids in five years of putting my
0:34:54.299,0:34:58.410,husband through graduate school or you
0:34:55.740,0:35:00.030,know stuff right yeah and
0:34:58.410,0:35:02.820,or helping to put him through the
0:35:00.030,0:35:05.460,graduate school and so I didn't really
0:35:02.820,0:35:08.580,start to write until I was home with no
0:35:05.460,0:35:11.910,money um taking care of three children
0:35:08.580,0:35:15.660,you know kind of yeah can't move
0:35:11.910,0:35:18.180,yeah resources only the radio really
0:35:15.660,0:35:29.550,kind of you know and I started to write
0:35:18.180,0:35:31.860,them but I I did not and then it one
0:35:29.550,0:35:34.290,point in there I won checkpoint I went
0:35:31.860,0:35:36.600,home for Christmas and my brother had
0:35:34.290,0:35:38.250,brought a friend and I remember I was
0:35:36.600,0:35:40.050,sitting brought kept with this youngest
0:35:38.250,0:35:43.440,child in my arms and this had added
0:35:40.050,0:35:44.640,mm-hmm talking late at night only the
0:35:43.440,0:35:46.620,lights of the Christmas tree around it
0:35:44.640,0:35:50.340,it just all sudden became clear to me
0:35:46.620,0:36:02.910,that this friend of his wrote poems and
0:35:50.340,0:36:07.530,was not tearing them up yeah oh yeah so
0:36:02.910,0:36:10.790,I then by that time I had my older
0:36:07.530,0:36:13.350,children room school in Yonkers and I
0:36:10.790,0:36:16.800,Sarah Lawrence had these writing
0:36:13.350,0:36:19.320,programs you know so I started to take
0:36:16.800,0:36:21.840,programs there and and in exchange to
0:36:19.320,0:36:22.440,pay for them I worked in the library
0:36:21.840,0:36:24.000,there Oh
0:36:22.440,0:36:25.650,which I didn't have any library training
0:36:24.000,0:36:29.130,neither but okay that's all right yeah
0:36:25.650,0:36:31.860,and and eventually they wanted me to get
0:36:29.130,0:36:35.790,the library training mm-hmm and I got
0:36:31.860,0:36:38.910,the library training by offering
0:36:35.790,0:36:40.740,Pratt students had courses in
0:36:38.910,0:36:43.200,Westchester and all around right mm-hmm
0:36:40.740,0:36:46.890,and Sarah Lyons had this computer this
0:36:43.200,0:36:48.630,is really early computer lab stuff and I
0:36:46.890,0:36:53.150,would teach the computer classes to the
0:36:48.630,0:36:59.030,prep people up there to pay for the
0:36:53.150,0:37:01.500,practice and so I know is it asked to
0:36:59.030,0:37:02.820,well they wanted to automate the
0:37:01.500,0:37:04.290,librarian wanted to automate the
0:37:02.820,0:37:08.180,language this is a tiny little library
0:37:04.290,0:37:12.660,yeah yeah so no one knew what that was I
0:37:08.180,0:37:16.220,mean they do the DLC right yeah but it
0:37:12.660,0:37:19.020,was like get a catalogue get the
0:37:16.220,0:37:29.190,circulation system which is yes they
0:37:19.020,0:37:35.940,might have um so I said sure oh yeah and
0:37:29.190,0:37:38.370,this is like early eighties okay Wow and
0:37:35.940,0:37:41.040,it's like this is like you know the
0:37:38.370,0:37:43.440,Washington library authority system or
0:37:41.040,0:37:46.290,Hennepin headings like you know I mean
0:37:43.440,0:37:49.260,it was like what's the right way to go I
0:37:46.290,0:37:52.050,mean you know you would do FTP downloads
0:37:49.260,0:37:54.750,of Eric database of stuff like that so
0:37:52.050,0:37:57.090,digitize stuff right now but it was
0:37:54.750,0:38:01.260,really you know yeah yeah that's really
0:37:57.090,0:38:05.670,so anyway that's how I sort of
0:38:01.260,0:38:07.740,well became aware of those kind of
0:38:05.670,0:38:09.570,issues you know it's in the meantime you
0:38:07.740,0:38:13.950,know I've gotten my MFA and all that
0:38:09.570,0:38:18.090,okay hot Sarah Lawrence and but I didn't
0:38:13.950,0:38:19.770,I really didn't send out some I mean I
0:38:18.090,0:38:20.400,hate these children I was racing yeah
0:38:19.770,0:38:29.240,full-time job
0:38:20.400,0:38:33.000,yeah right um so it's writing and then I
0:38:29.240,0:38:34.560,I think I somehow became aware of that
0:38:33.000,0:38:37.170,probably through poets and writers you
0:38:34.560,0:38:37.590,know McDowell and yato and stuff you
0:38:37.170,0:38:39.540,know
0:38:37.590,0:38:41.100,and so since stuff offered it so that
0:38:39.540,0:38:45.690,was like the first time I really had
0:38:41.100,0:38:47.190,time to write in that way yeah that was
0:38:45.690,0:38:50.820,like amazing for me that was very
0:38:47.190,0:38:53.580,valuable for me yeah and so I think that
0:38:50.820,0:38:57.270,must have been early 90s that was the
0:38:53.580,0:38:59.700,first book was published yeah
0:38:57.270,0:39:01.410,and then some of the next few won some
0:38:59.700,0:39:06.150,prizes and things right that you know
0:39:01.410,0:39:10.260,brick and and I own I'd won it I want a
0:39:06.150,0:39:11.910,cap which caps was a like a New York

0:45:30.680,0:45:36.860,having looking at it this week is great
0:45:32.950,0:45:40.280,is you can play its browser it's for the
0:45:36.860,0:45:44.060,browser you know yeah yeah not the same
0:45:40.280,0:45:48.740,on all browsers but you know pretty
0:45:44.060,0:45:50.360,pretty playable and the ballad was that
0:45:48.740,0:45:52.430,one but then you didn't you win the
0:45:50.360,0:45:54.690,contest with that one in transfer see no
0:45:52.430,0:46:01.109,no I did it was
0:45:54.690,0:46:04.049,yes yeah because I've read the yeah that
0:46:01.109,0:46:07.019,was but when I wrote it though I wrote
0:46:04.049,0:46:09.329,it in print it was written almost as a
0:46:07.019,0:46:11.849,response to the whole experience of the
0:46:09.329,0:46:15.119,neh session okay
0:46:11.849,0:46:18.180,because it was like it was just a whole
0:46:15.119,0:46:20.250,response to this silicon world
0:46:18.180,0:46:21.720,carbon-based world do you know I mean
0:46:20.250,0:46:24.119,like how they were clashing with each
0:46:21.720,0:46:27.150,other or not or their attraction to each
0:46:24.119,0:46:29.339,other or whatever so yeah although it
0:46:27.150,0:46:31.380,was prompted by my reaction to what
0:46:29.339,0:46:34.130,happened in computer and wrote it in
0:46:31.380,0:46:37.500,print because the length it is because
0:46:34.130,0:46:40.079,because whatever font size or whatever I
0:46:37.500,0:46:46.890,had you know it had to be 10 pages for
0:46:40.079,0:46:50.279,the boss of issues and so it was set off
0:46:46.890,0:46:53.130,for that but then it was was a natural
0:46:50.279,0:46:55.130,thing to do it because you know images
0:46:53.130,0:47:00.690,because there were so many things yeah
0:46:55.130,0:47:02.130,yeah so what what other I mean what
0:47:00.690,0:47:04.680,programming languages do you feel
0:47:02.130,0:47:12.829,comfortable in I don't feel comfortable
0:47:04.680,0:47:12.829,in any I feel I mean
0:47:12.880,0:47:17.350,I work with I collaborate with other
0:47:15.130,0:47:19.119,people great and in a lot of different
0:47:17.350,0:47:20.950,ways and big and I've been through a lot
0:47:19.119,0:47:28.480,of different things with them
0:47:20.950,0:47:30.880,yeah and my role is always to want
0:47:28.480,0:47:36.400,something that supposedly can't be done
0:47:30.880,0:47:38.950,and then this way I like to work face to
0:47:36.400,0:47:43.330,face and I almost always have mm-hmm
0:47:38.950,0:47:45.040,right because you need to just fool
0:47:43.330,0:47:46.720,around with it you know and and these
0:47:45.040,0:47:49.450,glitchy funny things happen and it's
0:47:46.720,0:47:51.910,great and you if you have a great good
0:47:49.450,0:47:54.400,collaborator then yeah for a very
0:47:51.910,0:47:55.869,simpatico collaborator right you're both
0:47:54.400,0:47:58.780,sitting there agreeing that it's you
0:47:55.869,0:48:10.000,know great or whatever and actually love
0:47:58.780,0:48:13.210,that process in in in the cases of
0:48:10.000,0:48:16.000,working with Margie and Cynthia I was
0:48:13.210,0:48:19.030,doing all of the linguistics okay and
0:48:16.000,0:48:19.540,and we were doing interface designed
0:48:19.030,0:48:21.160,together
0:48:19.540,0:48:22.840,I mean basically that was it how can we
0:48:21.160,0:48:25.290,make this happen this is the effect we
0:48:22.840,0:48:28.750,want to have happen ya know whatever
0:48:25.290,0:48:31.260,Margie had I mean in before Photoshop I
0:48:28.750,0:48:36.690,mean again these please it was so easy
0:48:31.260,0:48:39.580,we used to have these these applets from
0:48:36.690,0:48:40.930,yeah there was so many was so easy to
0:48:39.580,0:48:43.180,look at things and put things together
0:48:40.930,0:48:46.869,it was just we had just a wonderful time
0:48:43.180,0:48:48.850,yeah it she'd been in this in each
0:48:46.869,0:48:51.520,seminar as well with you as well yeah
0:48:48.850,0:48:53.740,and who are you speaking about her name
0:48:51.520,0:48:55.780,is well MD Coverley is what she writes
0:48:53.740,0:48:57.340,under okay miss marching loser bring she
0:48:55.780,0:49:01.470,she was present of the
0:48:57.340,0:49:08.830,yellow for Community College and Irvine
0:49:01.470,0:49:10.480,and and lives in Newport Beach and so we
0:49:08.830,0:49:11.800,used to go to SIGGRAPH together and we
0:49:10.480,0:49:14.620,you know we still go to all these
0:49:11.800,0:49:18.160,conferences to yeah very very close
0:49:14.620,0:49:19.780,friends and so but we were just gonna
0:49:18.160,0:49:22.060,really do it anyway I saw her tool book
0:49:19.780,0:49:25.720,thing was so great and she was so great
0:49:22.060,0:49:27.700,visually and you know we just have
0:49:25.720,0:49:29.260,different things to contribute yet you
0:49:27.700,0:49:30.940,know and do different design and if you
0:49:29.260,0:49:32.020,look at the stuff she but her own stuff
0:49:30.940,0:49:34.120,it is a much different
0:49:32.020,0:49:37.390,you would never confuse it right but
0:49:34.120,0:49:40.690,it's like each had influenced you know
0:49:37.390,0:49:42.400,kind of you know mhm so so death took
0:49:40.690,0:49:45.220,those were those things and then with
0:49:42.400,0:49:48.520,Cynthia with Cynthia was great because I
0:49:45.220,0:49:51.850,went to IDP and I just and know about
0:49:48.520,0:49:53.800,wardrobe throwing took me there and I
0:49:51.850,0:49:55.870,just said was there any the students
0:49:53.800,0:49:59.290,they were interested in poetry doing
0:49:55.870,0:50:00.850,okay yeah and Cynthia was she was very
0:49:59.290,0:50:03.880,literate she had an engineering degree
0:50:00.850,0:50:08.260,from Columbia in the country Columbia oh
0:50:03.880,0:50:11.740,and and she's moved on to completely
0:50:08.260,0:50:13.150,other things too but we did these two we
0:50:11.740,0:50:16.810,did the van Roosen we did the slipping
0:50:13.150,0:50:18.430,loose I mean and the so there's two
0:50:16.810,0:50:20.140,people that wanted to and say it was
0:50:18.430,0:50:21.520,really clear Cynthia was no first of it
0:50:20.140,0:50:24.220,you know we were gonna do this so we had
0:50:21.520,0:50:26.730,a lot of fun with cameras and slippy and
0:50:24.220,0:50:31.800,glimpse came because by
0:50:26.730,0:50:35.080,went to a talk on Catherine Bateson and
0:50:31.800,0:50:36.490,Paul Ryan was there showing some of
0:50:35.080,0:50:38.109,those videos mm-hmm
0:50:36.490,0:50:39.849,not the ones we actually ended up using
0:50:38.109,0:50:44.560,but some that are sort of similar yeah
0:50:39.849,0:50:46.330,other videos and I went up he used the
0:50:44.560,0:50:49.180,word crea which I'd never heard I would
0:50:46.330,0:50:51.940,have to ask him about it and I bought
0:50:49.180,0:50:54.119,his video mind earth mind thing okay and
0:50:51.940,0:50:57.550,I read through the book and there is a
0:50:54.119,0:50:59.380,diagram in it that's wrong and it turns
0:50:57.550,0:51:02.530,out that he and Cynthia are both
0:50:59.380,0:51:04.599,teaching at the middle school and I so
0:51:02.530,0:51:06.580,you know I don't you my said you know we
0:51:04.599,0:51:09.250,can fix this up for you we could make a
0:51:06.580,0:51:14.440,little program that'll make this right
0:51:09.250,0:51:17.589,yeah and and we'd love to use your some
0:51:14.440,0:51:20.500,of your so it was great with Kim that
0:51:17.589,0:51:21.970,came to his house and we've looked at
0:51:20.500,0:51:23.650,some of that although the one the
0:51:21.970,0:51:27.270,colored one the ones that I've used
0:51:23.650,0:51:31.359,yeah those are 10 of about 50 or so okay
0:51:27.270,0:51:33.520,and but a lot of things like I had to
0:51:31.359,0:51:36.730,become a lawyer and drop a kind of
0:51:33.520,0:51:41.290,contract for us stuff like that oh yeah
0:51:36.730,0:51:43.210,that's yeah and then at one point he
0:51:41.290,0:51:44.770,said yes you could use them and Cynthia
0:51:43.210,0:51:46.960,needed I'm in a certain form and he
0:51:44.770,0:51:48.609,wasn't really do processing him in this
0:51:46.960,0:51:50.530,digital form there was this one guy
0:51:48.609,0:51:51.430,working for him you know who was and all
0:51:50.530,0:51:53.290,that mm-hmm
0:51:51.430,0:51:54.849,and this guy close me up one night about
0:51:53.290,0:52:00.130,six o'clock it says which ones do you
0:51:54.849,0:52:01.869,want I'm the phone right yeah and so you
0:52:00.130,0:52:03.490,know you look at those other things it's
0:52:01.869,0:52:05.170,not the one with the water you can't see
0:52:03.490,0:52:07.720,the one that's green yes I know what you
0:52:05.170,0:52:09.790,know so I've often said that was the
0:52:07.720,0:52:10.290,most difficult linguistic job I've ever
0:52:09.790,0:52:13.230,had
0:52:10.290,0:52:17.190,do was to describe do you know without
0:52:13.230,0:52:20.450,any know without any yeah memory right
0:52:17.190,0:52:25.110,ten of these things from fifty that look
0:52:20.450,0:52:26.910,really yeah oh but then he loved it you
0:52:25.110,0:52:29.910,know he really loved at work and you
0:52:26.910,0:52:36.960,showed oh he died just recently in his
0:52:29.910,0:52:39.090,memorial yeah and he was a great guy and
0:52:36.960,0:52:42.300,so we were both we both had the
0:52:39.090,0:52:44.880,ecological and Cynthia's gone on to do a
0:52:42.300,0:52:50.060,lot of work educating people around the
0:52:44.880,0:52:53.790,she's part of Occupy okay this education
0:52:50.060,0:52:55.650,you know for the 99% kind of thing and
0:52:53.790,0:52:57.420,clearly these groups of students to
0:52:55.650,0:52:59.280,South America and so on so she doesn't
0:52:57.420,0:53:03.120,tempt him in that she also has a career
0:52:59.280,0:53:06.150,as a photographer hmm so I mean people
0:53:03.120,0:53:10.560,go off in these different directions
0:53:06.150,0:53:12.270,yeah yeah and then the thing was Nick is
0:53:10.560,0:53:13.830,that he had it sabbatical and he wanted
0:53:12.270,0:53:16.010,to do a lot of collaborations and he
0:53:13.830,0:53:18.180,came to me and never done it generator
0:53:16.010,0:53:20.550,generator was so different from anything
0:53:18.180,0:53:27.810,I've ever done right and I wasn't really
0:53:20.550,0:53:29.190,sure but he persuaded me and and so
0:53:27.810,0:53:30.900,there was a lot of letters a lot of do
0:53:29.190,0:53:32.250,you travel here I would travel that was
0:53:30.900,0:53:33.630,the hardest that wasn't like with
0:53:32.250,0:53:35.580,Cynthia she's in New York could just sit
0:53:33.630,0:53:37.500,down yeah or go visit or would just sit
0:53:35.580,0:53:39.720,down and do it right Nick was a little
0:53:37.500,0:53:42.750,harder to get together don't we did it
0:53:39.720,0:53:43.530,and then it's just super it was a lot of
0:53:42.750,0:53:46.920,interest in that
0:53:43.530,0:53:48.540,yeah I think there's been a lot of quick
0:53:46.920,0:53:50.329,you know critical work about it and
0:53:48.540,0:53:52.699,people who wanted to translate
0:53:50.329,0:53:54.469,and then we presented it Emily Dickinson
0:53:52.699,0:53:58.400,society when I didn't do it you know
0:53:54.469,0:54:03.160,they did their we did this subsequent
0:53:58.400,0:54:03.160,little generator called duals duets yeah
0:54:06.789,0:54:11.779,Ian's in New York too so we work you
0:54:09.439,0:54:13.339,know we've done a couple yeah done one
0:54:11.779,0:54:17.739,about libraries called house of trust
0:54:13.339,0:54:20.569,which is gonna be published in in volta
0:54:17.739,0:54:22.279,August great that's up though right you
0:54:20.569,0:54:23.809,can go to house of trusted see yeah yeah
0:54:22.279,0:54:26.059,have you seen it yeah yeah thanks so
0:54:23.809,0:54:33.319,committed this morning yeah it's got the
0:54:26.059,0:54:34.549,library it's so in these processes when
0:54:33.319,0:54:36.589,you're collaborating I mean do you have
0:54:34.549,0:54:37.729,the kind of traditional divisions
0:54:36.589,0:54:39.890,between your labor are you like
0:54:37.729,0:54:41.119,prewriting generating like you do in a
0:54:39.890,0:54:43.369,notebook and then you move to like a
0:54:41.119,0:54:45.529,place where you're kind of composing and
0:54:43.369,0:54:46.880,then revising and then finishing I mean
0:54:45.529,0:54:48.829,are there those stages or is it
0:54:46.880,0:54:51.049,different in some you know in some cases
0:54:48.829,0:54:53.179,the poem pre-existed so we know okay
0:54:51.049,0:54:55.819,working so you have a comment yeah well
0:54:53.179,0:54:58.429,we have that kind yes like that content
0:54:55.819,0:55:00.619,is good good it's very small compared to
0:54:58.429,0:55:02.479,how to design the interface right yeah
0:55:00.619,0:55:05.329,so I usually have revision just like
0:55:02.479,0:55:06.170,with the true north it's a vision that's
0:55:05.329,0:55:08.719,impossible
0:55:06.170,0:55:10.189,mm-hmm sort of an installation right so
0:55:08.719,0:55:13.130,at one point when I was at Georgia Tech
0:55:10.189,0:55:15.499,that the graduate student who was doing
0:55:13.130,0:55:17.709,the techno Poetry Festival with me we
0:55:15.499,0:55:20.900,really were gonna do it we looked into
0:55:17.709,0:55:23.420,you know we wanted it we wanted to have
0:55:20.900,0:55:24.949,the stars like sensors that came down
0:55:23.420,0:55:26.509,and you move among them when it released
0:55:24.949,0:55:28.729,the text and it would be mirrored it
0:55:26.509,0:55:34.279,would be water on the floor or on the
0:55:28.729,0:55:38.449,floor yeah so I would have a vision
0:55:34.279,0:55:40.099,about it and but there would be so it's
0:55:38.449,0:55:42.229,a learning process like with Nick it's
0:55:40.099,0:55:44.179,like so I want this ocean I want you to
0:55:42.229,0:55:44.849,fall off the ocean okay so we're okay so
0:55:44.179,0:55:46.319,we can make
0:55:44.849,0:55:49.680,Torres ativan or whatever I'm in other
0:55:46.319,0:55:52.499,words this it's a negotiation to find
0:55:49.680,0:55:56.009,out what you would do in the program to
0:55:52.499,0:55:58.349,have the effect of what you need top of
0:55:56.009,0:56:01.079,what you're envisioning yes yeah yeah
0:55:58.349,0:56:05.519,and then he's he's appalled himself yeah
0:56:01.079,0:56:09.930,and so the Lang and we both liked and by
0:56:05.519,0:56:12.239,chance had access to mm-hmm the lexicon
0:56:09.930,0:56:15.210,databases for both of those
0:56:12.239,0:56:17.309,oh yeah post digital humanities project
0:56:15.210,0:56:19.289,yeah yeah and we were looking through
0:56:17.309,0:56:23.069,what words are interesting what or not
0:56:19.289,0:56:25.140,and you know and then I'm in this just
0:56:23.069,0:56:27.089,generating the template phrases do you
0:56:25.140,0:56:28.410,know yeah I mean that was like so we
0:56:27.089,0:56:31.019,would talk about this and what they know
0:56:28.410,0:56:34.229,what do we want to put back and what
0:56:31.019,0:56:36.239,order do we want the words to be you
0:56:34.229,0:56:38.039,know ranged you know so alphabetic
0:56:36.239,0:56:40.380,mostly but fast-fish loosers because we
0:56:38.039,0:56:42.920,want them close together or at the end
0:56:40.380,0:56:46.109,do you know yes so it's this whole
0:56:42.920,0:56:48.960,understanding of the way you're doing
0:56:46.109,0:56:51.809,this right and then of course going on
0:56:48.960,0:56:54.329,from that the cut to fit the tools but
0:56:51.809,0:56:59.460,of course you know which was like a mega
0:56:54.329,0:57:01.469,piece yeah so getting into all those
0:56:59.460,0:57:04.229,questions was like a sort of a a
0:57:01.469,0:57:07.130,different thing and then and then I
0:57:04.229,0:57:09.809,wanted I mean he did it on Python Nick
0:57:07.130,0:57:11.789,pipes on first to kind of sketch it you
0:57:09.809,0:57:13.859,know okay then it was put into the he
0:57:11.789,0:57:15.479,didn't want NICUs you know if you see
0:57:13.859,0:57:17.400,his other generates it's not into color
0:57:15.479,0:57:20.960,he's not it right you know effort I had
0:57:17.400,0:57:20.960,a fight to get the blue
0:57:26.740,0:57:30.310,about the number of fish in the sea and
0:57:28.390,0:57:33.160,all that you know okay I don't get that
0:57:30.310,0:57:35.860,the blue thing but what do you learned
0:57:33.160,0:57:39.390,up I mean you learn so much from you
0:57:35.860,0:57:42.190,learn about each program and but as well
0:57:39.390,0:57:44.140,it's different sensibilities mm-hmm
0:57:42.190,0:57:45.640,thank you bring you yeah so Nixon I
0:57:44.140,0:57:48.910,think couldn't be more different in at
0:57:45.640,0:57:51.700,the same time I I we will always love
0:57:48.910,0:57:53.530,exactly the same things I mean their
0:57:51.700,0:57:55.480,mathematical their poetic their
0:57:53.530,0:57:57.970,structural they're the same things we'll
0:57:55.480,0:58:00.160,just and you know both the Cui's both
0:57:57.970,0:58:01.690,agree that it is not trivial whether or
0:58:00.160,0:58:05.470,not there's a hyphen between Moby and
0:58:01.690,0:58:07.600,Eric and do you know right you get far
0:58:05.470,0:58:10.810,enough away you say oh my god they're
0:58:07.600,0:58:13.570,like identical but then when you're
0:58:10.810,0:58:20.550,right there it's very very different now
0:58:13.570,0:58:22.390,yeah yeah no it's much more
0:58:20.550,0:58:24.640,opportunistic than what you're
0:58:22.390,0:58:26.200,suggesting okay it's like what do we
0:58:24.640,0:58:28.540,have access to what can we do in the
0:58:26.200,0:58:30.550,time we have yeah at that time that we
0:58:28.540,0:58:33.040,have to get together or how would this
0:58:30.550,0:58:35.170,work do you know so like the hole that
0:58:33.040,0:58:37.570,we both love Dickinson Melva do you know
0:58:35.170,0:58:40.090,me has just started up a generator what
0:58:37.570,0:58:42.880,what right yeah and then the duals duets
0:58:40.090,0:58:48.310,was there was a conference in yellow
0:58:42.880,0:58:49.660,conference and the name of the panel was
0:58:48.310,0:58:51.310,tools to answer something and it was
0:58:49.660,0:58:52.869,people didn't work collaboratively right
0:58:51.310,0:58:54.670,and so yeah we worked with and I was
0:58:52.869,0:58:57.040,like I was just aware of like all the
0:58:54.670,0:58:59.380,things that were different because with
0:58:57.040,0:59:00.880,Cynthia and Marjorie it was like it was
0:58:59.380,0:59:02.859,much more we're all doing the same
0:59:00.880,0:59:06.580,things so he went along right yeah much
0:59:02.859,0:59:08.830,more negotiation because generators yeah
0:59:06.580,0:59:09.809,so it was about the negotiations and
0:59:08.830,0:59:12.779,stuff like that but
0:59:09.809,0:59:15.359,had that thing and so I mean we did that
0:59:12.779,0:59:17.099,on the train and and over what do you
0:59:15.359,0:59:19.410,know just throwing those things in yeah
0:59:17.099,0:59:22.259,and I wanted it really realistic I
0:59:19.410,0:59:24.150,wanted you know some of the things that
0:59:22.259,0:59:26.160,actually do happen you know you run out
0:59:24.150,0:59:28.799,of time and you just you know that's the
0:59:26.160,0:59:31.859,reality of these collaborations yeah I
0:59:28.799,0:59:34.049,said you know it's not like some 10-year
0:59:31.859,0:59:37.579,project where you know every day I might
0:59:34.049,0:59:40.859,love that but it's not a medium it yeah
0:59:37.579,0:59:44.130,yeah and so and it's how much can you
0:59:40.859,0:59:47.069,get done in the time and like you hope
0:59:44.130,0:59:49.140,to god that you think of the right thing
0:59:47.069,0:59:53.670,at the moment that the person is able to
0:59:49.140,0:59:55.650,implement yeah you have this whole other
0:59:53.670,0:59:59.609,thing that's really important you didn't
0:59:55.650,1:00:00.900,skip your mind or whatever and talk to
0:59:59.609,1:00:03.029,some other people were brought into
1:00:00.900,1:00:05.279,those discussions to like the young man
1:00:03.029,1:00:07.049,who designed the cover for the spring
1:00:05.279,1:00:10.410,gonna edition and run you know so wait
1:00:07.049,1:00:13.739,so different aspects of do you know do
1:00:10.410,1:00:16.949,you know since I don't love social media
1:00:13.739,1:00:19.380,or whatever you know I definitely need
1:00:16.949,1:00:20.699,do from people who are using it as a way
1:00:19.380,1:00:23.819,it needs to be used
1:00:20.699,1:00:27.119,yeah you know need to be yeah how did
1:00:23.819,1:00:29.069,you develop your sort of sense of design
1:00:27.119,1:00:31.289,sense of what you could envision no no
1:00:29.069,1:00:33.089,you know what I'm I was really I wanted
1:00:31.289,1:00:35.459,to be do you want to be sort of a school
1:00:33.089,1:00:37.079,I think I did and I'm sure seen my
1:00:35.459,1:00:39.589,father build things and stuff all the
1:00:37.079,1:00:42.329,time was like it just was just more I
1:00:39.589,1:00:44.429,don't know and I don't know I don't know
1:00:42.329,1:00:46.709,that that why that would particularly
1:00:44.429,1:00:48.299,apply but I hope lots of people put
1:00:46.709,1:00:50.230,manuscripts together I mean if I see a
1:00:48.299,1:00:55.510,whole bunch of poems
1:00:50.230,1:00:57.520,I just you can some people do something
1:00:55.510,1:00:59.140,you have a sense for that great thing
1:00:57.520,1:01:01.180,and some other people I'm different you
1:00:59.140,1:01:03.849,know their their their sense their best
1:01:01.180,1:01:05.560,thing is at the palm level or at some
1:01:03.849,1:01:08.380,other level yeah critical level or
1:01:05.560,1:01:11.829,whatever yeah with the place that I seem
1:01:08.380,1:01:13.900,to operate pretty well is that putting
1:01:11.829,1:01:15.730,the structure together thing what do you
1:01:13.900,1:01:17.530,what do you see at that level I mean
1:01:15.730,1:01:22.810,what are you after you know it's just
1:01:17.530,1:01:24.640,like I see I see are there a here or
1:01:22.810,1:01:28.510,something as well you see something I
1:01:24.640,1:01:30.550,mean online it's often a visual thing
1:01:28.510,1:01:32.619,okay but in your manuscript it's like
1:01:30.550,1:01:34.150,this is leading tone like we need to how
1:01:32.619,1:01:36.730,we going to get in and what's gonna lead
1:01:34.150,1:01:38.560,to this and what and how and do not bore
1:01:36.730,1:01:40.119,me by putting this next to this because
1:01:38.560,1:01:47.109,I got you know anything that there's
1:01:40.119,1:01:49.060,like it's not an arc okay I mean it's
1:01:47.109,1:01:54.400,not like a theatrical you're not
1:01:49.060,1:01:57.130,thinking of like a dramatic part what is
1:01:54.400,1:01:59.020,what is this me well and I don't want it
1:01:57.130,1:02:01.260,any editor it's levering oppressor yeah
1:01:59.020,1:02:03.760,um
1:02:01.260,1:02:06.819,what does this mean just good really
1:02:03.760,1:02:08.980,about what does it really do better than
1:02:06.819,1:02:11.079,anything else I mean when you know at
1:02:08.980,1:02:14.530,the heart of it mm-hmm that has to come
1:02:11.079,1:02:19.270,out and so how do you introduce the
1:02:14.530,1:02:21.400,person to that the reader mm-hm and and
1:02:19.270,1:02:23.140,then how do you complicate it in an
1:02:21.400,1:02:25.210,interesting way do you know what do you
1:02:23.140,1:02:27.099,mean and how do you pace it so that the
1:02:25.210,1:02:31.210,person you know it's like a reading pace
1:02:27.099,1:02:33.819,right right now right and will there be
1:02:31.210,1:02:36.010,any use to divisions or will there be
1:02:33.819,1:02:37.569,used to the naming of divisions is that
1:02:36.010,1:02:40.339,what you know is there in order to
1:02:37.569,1:02:41.479,suppress that or is it you know
1:02:40.339,1:02:45.469,no it's just something about the
1:02:41.479,1:02:48.769,individuality of the work that will
1:02:45.469,1:02:50.239,suggest you know or will suggest this is
1:02:48.769,1:02:52.460,great but you know this thing just
1:02:50.239,1:02:54.769,doesn't go there and it always asks
1:02:52.460,1:02:57.950,people to send me you know like all the
1:02:54.769,1:03:00.079,outtakes too because often yeah you can
1:02:57.950,1:03:02.809,always do go there right you know any
1:03:00.079,1:03:05.089,raters and sometimes they took them out
1:03:02.809,1:03:09.920,because it was too close to the bone or
1:03:05.089,1:03:11.420,they you know yeah um when you're when
1:03:09.920,1:03:13.999,you're working on let's say you're at
1:03:11.420,1:03:17.180,your own poem like an individual poem I
1:03:13.999,1:03:19.489,mean what are you revising towards a
1:03:17.180,1:03:21.140,sound and that way - are you do you hear
1:03:19.489,1:03:23.150,totally don't know if I realize towards
1:03:21.140,1:03:28.390,them but I certainly read it out loud I
1:03:23.150,1:03:34.009,mean I certainly it's certainly not just
1:03:28.390,1:03:35.930,a visual yeah it's not and it may be
1:03:34.009,1:03:38.329,conceptual but it's not conceptual
1:03:35.930,1:03:42.019,without reference moving to the other
1:03:38.329,1:03:44.509,sensory modalities so for sure it has to
1:03:42.019,1:03:47.719,read right yeah in my mouth in your
1:03:44.509,1:03:49.969,mouth and had that been like the case
1:03:47.719,1:03:52.849,ever since you started now yeah I think
1:03:49.969,1:03:59.269,so I mean I nursery rhymes it yeah right
1:03:52.849,1:04:00.950,so it's always I think so yeah well then
1:03:59.269,1:04:03.710,something like like the red version
1:04:00.950,1:04:05.869,which is indexical right and in its and
1:04:03.710,1:04:07.819,I mean like how did you if it's indexed
1:04:05.869,1:04:09.799,I mean like what how is that is that how
1:04:07.819,1:04:15.049,did you put your stamp on that you know
1:04:09.799,1:04:16.950,it's like uh when I was first reading
1:04:15.049,1:04:19.770,see mother I was very
1:04:16.950,1:04:20.930,about the way people responded to her
1:04:19.770,1:04:24.270,yeah
1:04:20.930,1:04:25.890,because either they couldn't stand her
1:04:24.270,1:04:27.420,religious site or they couldn't stand
1:04:25.890,1:04:29.670,her political side and you would name
1:04:27.420,1:04:34.500,the other one as right whatever you know
1:04:29.670,1:04:36.990,no one would see her as like one person
1:04:34.500,1:04:39.120,that one person could have these sides
1:04:36.990,1:04:43.980,and do you know that her she could come
1:04:39.120,1:04:46.500,from that and so and I read the visions
1:04:43.980,1:04:48.870,of Simone Mashhad Brecht play you know I
1:04:46.500,1:04:50.280,think is the best work that's been done
1:04:48.870,1:04:52.260,about her is your picture work there are
1:04:50.280,1:04:54.480,some other plays and things about her
1:04:52.260,1:04:57.930,and stuff that I thought were unbearably
1:04:54.480,1:04:59.730,reductionistic yeah so I did not want
1:04:57.930,1:05:04.230,that and so from that point of view I
1:04:59.730,1:05:06.180,wanted a lot of materials I wanted you
1:05:04.230,1:05:07.830,know document some documentary materials
1:05:06.180,1:05:13.920,I wanted to cover certain things you
1:05:07.830,1:05:15.780,have to use her language so the they
1:05:13.920,1:05:18.810,pretty much stuff was named the way it
1:05:15.780,1:05:20.450,was but then from that point of view how
1:05:18.810,1:05:23.130,are you gonna put them together mm-hmm
1:05:20.450,1:05:25.440,it was exactly the fact that there was
1:05:23.130,1:05:27.090,so many people quite so many different
1:05:25.440,1:05:33.570,takes on it you know yeah
1:05:27.090,1:05:36.150,so I yes it's almost indexical because
1:05:33.570,1:05:38.430,and this was a consideration wherever he
1:05:36.150,1:05:42.360,started I wanted you to be able to start
1:05:38.430,1:05:44.610,anywhere mm-hmm and the poems are
1:05:42.360,1:05:47.040,written that way so that so that like if
1:05:44.610,1:05:48.210,her brother is named I mean it's not no
1:05:47.040,1:05:50.160,matter where you start you'll know it's
1:05:48.210,1:05:52.200,her brother in some way I mean things
1:05:50.160,1:05:56.180,are dropped in you yeah it makes sense
1:05:52.200,1:05:58.860,of it yeah have a different impression
1:05:56.180,1:06:02.090,mmm depending on where you stir yes and
1:05:58.860,1:06:04.530,that was part of the point right mm-hmm
1:06:02.090,1:06:07.410,though I think most people will read it
1:06:04.530,1:06:09.740,straight through you know yeah but part
1:06:07.410,1:06:12.450,of the point was like it's just
1:06:09.740,1:06:13.980,impossible the number and again this is
1:06:12.450,1:06:15.580,seeing things in the round sort of do
1:06:13.980,1:06:17.530,you know yeah they reading
1:06:15.580,1:06:19.630,or you have people were supposedly
1:06:17.530,1:06:22.270,sympathetic like Robert Coles you know
1:06:19.630,1:06:24.250,which in his own way was just most
1:06:22.270,1:06:26.890,productive of all right now right and
1:06:24.250,1:06:28.570,it's like and then so then it was
1:06:26.890,1:06:31.000,interesting to me that the Italian woman
1:06:28.570,1:06:33.970,went head up by her biography with so
1:06:31.000,1:06:35.230,much less reductive the Italian woman
1:06:33.970,1:06:38.560,psychiatrists Oh
1:06:35.230,1:06:40.570,Coles okay I'm sorry and so it's like
1:06:38.560,1:06:42.580,how is it is it the way a woman reads it
1:06:40.570,1:06:44.440,is it the way you know if you coming
1:06:42.580,1:06:46.180,from the political side if you're coming
1:06:44.440,1:06:47.920,from the religious all these people have
1:06:46.180,1:06:52.030,so many too many irons in the fire right
1:06:47.920,1:06:54.250,so I wanted to you know tell it the way
1:06:52.030,1:06:56.950,I read it from the thoughtfulness I kind
1:06:54.250,1:06:58.990,of keep it but accurate as far as I was
1:06:56.950,1:07:04.170,a book that I mean he makes stuff up
1:06:58.990,1:07:06.550,yeah um and in fact after I done in the
1:07:04.170,1:07:08.470,year year-and-a-half whatever putting it
1:07:06.550,1:07:10.030,together and I stopped reading about her
1:07:08.470,1:07:13.050,you know no Mike
1:07:10.030,1:07:15.310,somebody's gonna publish some book that
1:07:13.050,1:07:16.930,completely overturns this whole thing
1:07:15.310,1:07:18.820,you know they're lined out that whatever
1:07:16.930,1:07:21.130,it is said that write an important that
1:07:18.820,1:07:22.630,didn't happen actually but um but I
1:07:21.130,1:07:23.710,didn't have that worried for a while you
1:07:22.630,1:07:25.870,know that go out and read all these
1:07:23.710,1:07:28.060,other books you know anything so and I
1:07:25.870,1:07:30.370,didn't feel that was it's bad but but
1:07:28.060,1:07:31.600,what I also realize this like I could
1:07:30.370,1:07:34.240,get out of a lot of things but I
1:07:31.600,1:07:37.960,couldn't really get a good thinking
1:07:34.240,1:07:40.120,so that you more on that in losing women
1:07:37.960,1:07:42.190,you are that that stuff where you trying
1:07:40.120,1:07:44.080,to talk about some of her the Incans in
1:07:42.190,1:07:48.700,a long line of people trying to think in
1:07:44.080,1:07:50.890,in odd ways you know yeah so that was
1:07:48.700,1:07:52.690,return return to that but yeah that
1:07:50.890,1:07:57.010,indexical thing there in that sense that
1:07:52.690,1:08:00.550,that the book had come out of reaction
1:07:57.010,1:08:03.910,to this polarized yeah assessment yeah
1:08:00.550,1:08:06.610,you know right if if you had at that
1:08:03.910,1:08:08.290,time already taking the class with with
1:08:06.610,1:08:09.420,the Katherine Hayles head would you do
1:08:08.290,1:08:12.430,you think you would have tried to
1:08:09.420,1:08:15.680,represent that in a digital fashion well
1:08:12.430,1:08:17.390,possibly yeah I do there's
1:08:15.680,1:08:20.600,little essay called seven-league boots
1:08:17.390,1:08:21.319,mm-hmm where I talk which is a hypertext
1:08:20.600,1:08:24.529,essay
1:08:21.319,1:08:28.150,Oh long ago and and she's in there she's
1:08:24.529,1:08:28.150,quoted in there in a way uh-huh
1:08:28.420,1:08:31.839,possibly yeah
1:08:32.980,1:08:38.080,and that she just been an interest of
1:08:34.900,1:08:46.600,years for most of your adult life funny
1:08:38.080,1:08:49.360,because I was in I know if any there was
1:08:46.600,1:08:52.480,a this book store in midtown wonderful
1:08:49.360,1:08:54.760,books I might add now go on and I was in
1:08:52.480,1:09:01.110,the philosophy section or something I
1:08:54.760,1:09:01.110,mean looking at it all brown gray books
1:09:03.750,1:09:11.260,pink book so I took this one pink book
1:09:08.440,1:09:14.020,which turned out to be a biography of
1:09:11.260,1:09:15.400,her and that's how I got started and
1:09:14.020,1:09:17.080,then it turned out that at Sarah
1:09:15.400,1:09:18.460,Lawrence we had most of her work because
1:09:17.080,1:09:20.020,there was a man there who was teaching
1:09:18.460,1:09:22.750,her I didn't know at the time I remember
1:09:20.020,1:09:24.820,ever I just loved the way she wrote she
1:09:22.750,1:09:27.310,has a woman who knew her own mind yes
1:09:24.820,1:09:29.590,she wrote with an authority and I was
1:09:27.310,1:09:31.060,really tired of well I mean there would
1:09:29.590,1:09:32.290,be these things oh yeah for a woman
1:09:31.060,1:09:33.670,she's sort of a good flood I mean you
1:09:32.290,1:09:35.560,know there was this was the whole top
1:09:33.670,1:09:40.420,rate of the seventies and eighties it
1:09:35.560,1:09:44.860,could not women's minds we're not well
1:09:40.420,1:09:47.230,respected and I just I loved the way she
1:09:44.860,1:09:49.450,wrote do you know I had a lot of trouble
1:09:47.230,1:09:51.250,I mean she again she let the software
1:09:49.450,1:09:52.990,pass through all these things she was
1:09:51.250,1:09:55.120,doing this political stuff the factory
1:09:52.990,1:09:56.530,work and all that oh yeah at the end of
1:09:55.120,1:09:58.390,her life and her notebooks which I think
1:09:56.530,1:10:00.250,it's totally unfair you know I mean we
1:09:58.390,1:10:01.840,judge her on basis of her student notes
1:10:00.250,1:10:03.730,and notebooks that were never published
1:10:01.840,1:10:05.350,and notebooks that didn't include all
1:10:03.730,1:10:09.430,the mathematics and stuff she put in
1:10:05.350,1:10:10.930,there yeah so um but you know when she
1:10:09.430,1:10:14.320,started going into folklore and stuff
1:10:10.930,1:10:16.600,like that I mean it's too far right but
1:10:14.320,1:10:17.590,then you know then I eventually caught
1:10:16.600,1:10:22.060,up with her
1:10:17.590,1:10:23.290,yeah but no I just still just riveted I
1:10:22.060,1:10:25.570,mean the way she writes is just
1:10:23.290,1:10:27.910,everything to me yeah and I was just
1:10:25.570,1:10:29.470,angry that people couldn't see it I just
1:10:27.910,1:10:31.840,thought the points of view that were
1:10:29.470,1:10:36.070,brought to criticize her were just not
1:10:31.840,1:10:37.630,adequate to what she was and so they
1:10:36.070,1:10:41.800,just kind of made me mad you know
1:10:37.630,1:10:50.500,so it's anger one of the common lessons
1:10:41.800,1:10:52.990,from what you write right right loved it
1:10:50.500,1:10:54.940,so much I mean I really admired it so
1:10:52.990,1:10:59.760,much you know then it just didn't seem
1:10:54.940,1:11:03.340,fair and it just didn't see anything
1:10:59.760,1:11:05.050,yeah anyway though a lot of people took
1:11:03.340,1:11:08.650,a lot of people have told me that that's
1:11:05.050,1:11:10.690,helped them write biographical or life
1:11:08.650,1:11:13.570,remember things do you know as a way to
1:11:10.690,1:11:16.150,do that yeah they sort of you know that
1:11:13.570,1:11:18.310,I was struck by how contemporary it
1:11:16.150,1:11:19.360,seemed when I you know what in preparing
1:11:18.310,1:11:21.640,for this just reading it and thinking
1:11:19.360,1:11:23.910,about all the like in the last decade
1:11:21.640,1:11:27.910,all the kind of you know focused
1:11:23.910,1:11:29.680,thematic books yeah and documentary in
1:11:27.910,1:11:31.150,the with poetry of witness and all that
1:11:29.680,1:11:40.240,no she's like this is me this is all
1:11:31.150,1:11:42.790
1993 as I expected you've totally blown
1:11:40.240,1:11:43.770,up all my questions but it's good it's
1:11:42.790,1:11:47.350,good
1:11:43.770,1:11:49.840,but I do I do want to get a little bit
1:11:47.350,1:11:52.870,more at the revision and sort of kind of
1:11:49.840,1:11:55.810,like it's true in the prewriting and
1:11:52.870,1:12:00.190,revision process for you of your of your
1:11:55.810,1:12:02.500,nan okay well that's you know I don't
1:12:00.190,1:12:05.350,even know what that is I guess I guess
1:12:02.500,1:12:06.970,like the compositional mode like so when
1:12:05.350,1:12:09.160,you sit down with your notebooks I would
1:12:06.970,1:12:15.970,consider that sort of yeah yeah what is
1:12:09.160,1:12:17.250,not okay this might say 14 May 2013
1:12:15.970,1:12:20.550,uh-huh
1:12:17.250,1:12:23.490,maybe 20 May 2014
1:12:20.550,1:12:25.380,so MIT a year later right and it's like
1:12:23.490,1:12:27.360,in the meantime I went to these
1:12:25.380,1:12:29.370,conferences and took notes and they're
1:12:27.360,1:12:30.660,like kind of lying around here and do I
1:12:29.370,1:12:34.020,have a chance to get back look at them
1:12:30.660,1:12:35.430,no because I started to read me a suit
1:12:34.020,1:12:37.620,and I just wrote a paper about to see
1:12:35.430,1:12:39.570,male inmates oh okay this is good but
1:12:37.620,1:12:42.570,why is it somebody writes something or
1:12:39.570,1:12:43.830,something you know or I get solicited to
1:12:42.570,1:12:45.360,do something else yeah this was a
1:12:43.830,1:12:46.890,religion and literature like through
1:12:45.360,1:12:48.420,Fanny how or something Kenny how and
1:12:46.890,1:12:51.090,I've got to see my base society right
1:12:48.420,1:12:53.160,okay and then Romana Huck is at Notre
1:12:51.090,1:12:54.990,Dame and I published it Notre Dame until
1:12:53.160,1:12:57.330,I get lined up they talking Steve does
1:12:54.990,1:12:59.280,something whatever right now you don't
1:12:57.330,1:13:02.070,even know how I got I'm a sue
1:12:59.280,1:13:03.630,I really don't thank you but I was
1:13:02.070,1:13:06.210,talking to a lot of you bought me a suit
1:13:03.630,1:13:10.680,and then he writes the the number and
1:13:06.210,1:13:13.350,desiring which is like no no it's about
1:13:10.680,1:13:15.630,Mallory screw today okay and it's the
1:13:13.350,1:13:17.220,best book of literary criticism I ever
1:13:15.630,1:13:20.400,made in my whole life
1:13:17.220,1:13:23.010,Wow so like I'm reading this you know
1:13:20.400,1:13:26.160,and then they realize like oh my god you
1:13:23.010,1:13:28.440,know all of his philosophy comes out of
1:13:26.160,1:13:32.100,his the way he's talking about this poem
1:13:28.440,1:13:35.490,yeah so it's like the poem it's malhomme
1:13:32.100,1:13:40.080,it's driving Mesut right and in case of
1:13:35.490,1:13:42.270,a the the Iliad really do you know was
1:13:40.080,1:13:44.160,dry you know any medium like this is it
1:13:42.270,1:13:47.430,just do you mean everybody does it the
1:13:44.160,1:13:50.370,other way but you know yeah so yes so
1:13:47.430,1:13:52.080,they can I do that or I do some rather
1:13:50.370,1:13:55.740,fight and then I still haven't gone back
1:13:52.080,1:13:57.510,over the notes right it's from four
1:13:55.740,1:14:01.210,years ago or with you
1:13:57.510,1:14:02.949,but there's kind of a set of things
1:14:01.210,1:14:04.630,which is where I'm about to start to
1:14:02.949,1:14:05.980,write you know there's a kind of
1:14:04.630,1:14:08.710,notebooks like that and there's sort of
1:14:05.980,1:14:10.750,notebooks that are kind of mathy or
1:14:08.710,1:14:15.610,whatever kind of thing and there might
1:14:10.750,1:14:17.679,be some that are like semi philosophical
1:14:15.610,1:14:19.539,literary I mean they just have different
1:14:17.679,1:14:22.389,things that they want and there's no
1:14:19.539,1:14:24.159,real control over them so yeah any women
1:14:22.389,1:14:25.539,moment there's a list of things to do
1:14:24.159,1:14:27.400,and things that I write at the back of
1:14:25.539,1:14:28.929,it or whatever you know yeah I have to
1:14:27.400,1:14:32.829,be small enough to I could carry around
1:14:28.929,1:14:36.820,it right on the bus over and would be or
1:14:32.829,1:14:38.829,find that in my do yeah I part of this
1:14:36.820,1:14:40.869,program and I get access to the Columbia
1:14:38.829,1:14:44.170,and NYU libraries which is great right
1:14:40.869,1:14:51.190,to the New York Public Library yeah so
1:14:44.170,1:14:53.050,okay where things are I mean it's like
1:14:51.190,1:14:55.090,it's a conference if somebody says you
1:14:53.050,1:14:56.679,want to do beyond the panel about
1:14:55.090,1:14:59.559,something right yeah you know where do
1:14:56.679,1:15:01.360,you wanna or let's make this work or we
1:14:59.559,1:15:04.059,get all of a sudden you know whatever
1:15:01.360,1:15:04.840,and you know a third of those things
1:15:04.059,1:15:08.739,never happen
1:15:04.840,1:15:12.880,great I guess I'm wondering then how all
1:15:08.739,1:15:14.500,this on you know not controlled work and
1:15:12.880,1:15:22.809,note-taking and everything then becomes
1:15:14.500,1:15:26.170,a poem or poetry so it's like obviously
1:15:22.809,1:15:28.119,in the case of where there's a somebody
1:15:26.170,1:15:29.070,says be on a panel or be a paper or we
1:15:28.119,1:15:32.460,need it
1:15:29.070,1:15:34.050,yeah like there's a paper you do
1:15:32.460,1:15:36.660,something you make an app and then you
1:15:34.050,1:15:38.220,talk about what is it to translate from
1:15:36.660,1:15:39.540,one form of software to another isn't
1:15:38.220,1:15:41.070,yeah yeah they're all sort of kind of
1:15:39.540,1:15:43.440,makes sense yeah or you do this thing
1:15:41.070,1:15:44.910,like seeing spire and then somebody
1:15:43.440,1:15:46.770,wants something for a special issue of
1:15:44.910,1:15:49.470,digitally matter its quarterly right
1:15:46.770,1:15:51.750,okay like we're gonna make a paper
1:15:49.470,1:15:53.310,that's running code right because that's
1:15:51.750,1:15:56.130,what people don't do they don't look at
1:15:53.310,1:16:01.350,the code and we want you know they said
1:15:56.130,1:16:05.220,that right yeah so it's like but oh yeah
1:16:01.350,1:16:09.990,absolutely a little bit deflected from
1:16:05.220,1:16:16.170,where you were with here whatever so
1:16:09.990,1:16:26.610,it's not completely uncontrolled yeah
1:16:16.170,1:16:33.420,not control sure yeah no I'll just bring
1:16:26.610,1:16:35.610,this thing oh so this is like a maze
1:16:33.420,1:16:38.010,suitcase and there's a caring broad
1:16:35.610,1:16:39.510,thing so the whole there's a lot of
1:16:38.010,1:16:45.240,stuff going on now in my mind around
1:16:39.510,1:16:47.820,care abroad okay yeah and then these are
1:16:45.240,1:16:50.610,free talks that I have to be writing on
1:16:47.820,1:16:52.740,right now you're including many right is
1:16:50.610,1:16:54.600,it talk at the binding in the archive
1:16:52.740,1:16:56.460,this is where a Slovakian magazine oh
1:16:54.600,1:16:59.400,that's the archive oh yeah I have to be
1:16:56.460,1:17:01.620,in some kind of feminist cyber panel or
1:16:59.400,1:17:09.180,whatever okay kind of thing this is the
1:17:01.620,1:17:12.060,paper after you and you uh-huh so all
1:17:09.180,1:17:13.650,the readings like so mostly since the
1:17:12.060,1:17:15.420,two books came out this year did a lot
1:17:13.650,1:17:16.440,of reading great you're right that's it
1:17:15.420,1:17:19.110,when you're doing a lot of readings
1:17:16.440,1:17:20.400,you're writing the things for the
1:17:19.110,1:17:20.750,readings that's good for the readings
1:17:20.400,1:17:26.930,it's
1:17:20.750,1:17:30.110,yeah so it's not but see these notes are
1:17:26.930,1:17:31.760,still here from when neo c2 came out we
1:17:30.110,1:17:36.920,were talking about that you know which I
1:17:31.760,1:17:44.570,haven't yeah it's it's between control
1:17:36.920,1:17:46.400,them right okay okay but but do you ever
1:17:44.570,1:17:47.870,I mean I guess are there ever times when
1:17:46.400,1:17:50.300,you all of a sudden you're like I need
1:17:47.870,1:17:59.510,to like write this book now I need to
1:17:50.300,1:18:01.760,put yeah do a lot of babysitting in the
1:17:59.510,1:18:03.740,first in the preschool years so my
1:18:01.760,1:18:06.140,granddaughter's my son was teaching at
1:18:03.740,1:18:09.380,Columbia when they were little
1:18:06.140,1:18:12.290,yeah going there both parents working

1:18:15.320,1:18:22.880,five okay so there's a lot of in my
1:18:20.330,1:18:25.000,daughter it has been yelled for 25 years
1:18:22.880,1:18:28.850,and hurts a lot of time so it's like
1:18:25.000,1:18:32.270,like I told you about this so this like
1:18:28.850,1:18:34.490,things that just yes and it used to be
1:18:32.270,1:18:36.920,that the colonies were the answer to
1:18:34.490,1:18:39.560,that okay apply and go there now
1:18:36.920,1:18:41.840,suggesting I don't have a car yeah
1:18:39.560,1:18:44.690,everything you have to carry and you
1:18:41.840,1:18:46.760,know yeah it's kind of I have to bring
1:18:44.690,1:18:49.699,all these little piles I just showed you
1:18:46.760,1:18:52.389,Megan be traveling by other
1:18:49.699,1:18:55.309,that doesn't work so well anymore yeah
1:18:52.389,1:19:00.139,and yet if I'm right here then
1:18:55.309,1:19:02.749,everything is do you know yeah sure
1:19:00.139,1:19:06.050,so that just gets harder right but
1:19:02.749,1:19:07.519,definitely definitely that you know that
1:19:06.050,1:19:10.459,happens they're trying to work out how
1:19:07.519,1:19:20.239,to get the time to do that you can't
1:19:10.459,1:19:21.110,becomes an issue and do you have any new
1:19:20.239,1:19:26.059,book projects
1:19:21.110,1:19:28.099,I mean well like better closer well I
1:19:26.059,1:19:33.829,have pop many poems I don't necessarily
1:19:28.099,1:19:36.499,know that they're a book thing I thought
1:19:33.829,1:19:38.209,about doing a new one selected kind of
1:19:36.499,1:19:39.229,thing which I haven't done I was
1:19:38.209,1:19:40.729,thinking about that on the walk over
1:19:39.229,1:19:44.170,here like what what a new ID like I
1:19:40.729,1:19:58.099,selected for you would look like yeah
1:19:44.170,1:20:00.700,yeah yeah I mean you know yeah it's hard
1:19:58.099,1:20:02.380,to know where the
1:20:00.700,1:20:04.090,I used to put your time I mean also I'm
1:20:02.380,1:20:06.100,on the board of the yellow and that do a
1:20:04.090,1:20:07.690,lot of stuff is going on with that
1:20:06.100,1:20:22.270,actually yeah how to where you're really
1:20:07.690,1:20:24.700,expanding yes yeah and that day with me
1:20:22.270,1:20:26.800,but or you could just had a place to go
1:20:24.700,1:20:29.260,well you know but is again the place to
1:20:26.800,1:20:30.580,go is take you know in a way I guess
1:20:29.260,1:20:33.160,it's good to go and take nothing with
1:20:30.580,1:20:35.410,you but actually I really want to be in
1:20:33.160,1:20:39.190,touch with these things i I do work off
1:20:35.410,1:20:41.140,yeah absolutely yeah and and they do
1:20:39.190,1:20:43.580,like the collaborative process I think I
1:20:41.140,1:20:44.880,think everything is to put couple more
1:20:43.580,1:20:46.150,[Music]
1:20:44.880,1:20:49.450,mm-hmm
1:20:46.150,1:20:52.240,I think that's the stuff I'm most
1:20:49.450,1:20:56.110,interested in do you know you know how
1:20:52.240,1:20:58.870,how can we make our not meld our minds
1:20:56.110,1:21:06.370,but you know different streams of
1:20:58.870,1:21:09.520,expertise and interest and ya know
1:21:06.370,1:21:10.930,something and then I you know I because
1:21:09.520,1:21:12.850,I do have to his grandchildren you know
1:21:10.930,1:21:16.510,it's do you know it's like what is the
1:21:12.850,1:21:21.910,most important to in born quite late to
1:21:16.510,1:21:28.030,my trophy okay yes yes a long time right
1:21:21.910,1:21:35.539,more so what's the most important thing
1:21:28.030,1:21:38.690,yeah and then I guess so then were there
1:21:35.539,1:21:48.019,times in your life where you weren't so
1:21:38.690,1:21:49.760,busy that you would lung cancer and was
1:21:48.019,1:21:52.039,ill for 20 years and for each of those
1:21:49.760,1:21:57.229,years we were told you had a year to
1:21:52.039,1:21:59.840,live Wow and my my my best friend was
1:21:57.229,1:22:01.719,just had terminal cancer for the last
1:21:59.840,1:22:03.829,two-and-a-half years and for the last
1:22:01.719,1:22:05.809,like year and a half of that she's on
1:22:03.829,1:22:07.280,Hospice and I was going out every month
1:22:05.809,1:22:08.749,to spend it
1:22:07.280,1:22:10.849,yeah weak with heart because it was a
1:22:08.749,1:22:15.590,hospice in her home right you know so
1:22:10.849,1:22:17.150,it's been a lot of long-term piercings
1:22:15.590,1:22:20.090,yes I've actually been involved with
1:22:17.150,1:22:24.590,yeah and doing a lot of things at the
1:22:20.090,1:22:32.209,same time but those times like they got
1:22:24.590,1:22:35.869,Jana McDowell Geraci right down those
1:22:32.209,1:22:38.989,were really really wonderful times like
1:22:35.869,1:22:41.300,yeah it's that memory of an island the
1:22:38.989,1:22:43.280,time and so how do you find it and how
1:22:41.300,1:22:48.110,do you make it through self great
1:22:43.280,1:22:50.300,breathe and I mean has this maybe
1:22:48.110,1:22:52.430,bad question but this has the caretaking
1:22:50.300,1:22:54.560,like entered into your I mean like have
1:22:52.430,1:22:57.020,you thought sorry to think about yeah
1:22:54.560,1:22:59.750,there's one specific poem like what's in
1:22:57.020,1:23:02.540,the best American poetry this year yes
1:22:59.750,1:23:10.630,introductions just mentions as one of
1:23:02.540,1:23:12.740,its dances okay Claire I I kind of and
1:23:10.630,1:23:21.050,and get the body back there's some
1:23:12.740,1:23:23.420,mother-daughter in okay but I kind of it
1:23:21.050,1:23:26.150,feels exploitive when you're so up close
1:23:23.420,1:23:27.380,yeah to people who are really ill and
1:23:26.150,1:23:28.790,you're dealing with it all the time
1:23:27.380,1:23:34.010,mmm-hmm
1:23:28.790,1:23:36.770,it's such a demand to be present to them
1:23:34.010,1:23:40.070,when you are yeah he caught it with them
1:23:36.770,1:23:44.320,yeah that the the writing demand is for
1:23:40.070,1:23:49.240,a distance deceiving me yeah again and I
1:23:44.320,1:23:52.040,don't find those compatible but I'm
1:23:49.240,1:23:53.750,certain that underneath almost
1:23:52.040,1:23:55.350,everything they care about in the way I
1:23:53.750,1:23:57.840,think about it
1:23:55.350,1:24:01.110,is this understanding that there needs
1:23:57.840,1:24:02.850,to be space for these people who don't
1:24:01.110,1:24:04.880,have the same chances and Doug you know
1:24:02.850,1:24:07.710,mm-hmm
1:24:04.880,1:24:10.320,and this is all well and good but have
1:24:07.710,1:24:11.850,you thought do you know yeah and I think
1:24:10.320,1:24:13.770,that's one of the reason that Simone
1:24:11.850,1:24:16.740,based thought you know appeals to me
1:24:13.770,1:24:20.000,also because she was always always
1:24:16.740,1:24:20.000,understanding that yeah
1:24:22.559,1:24:29.230,right no I think I could see that the
1:24:25.420,1:24:31.630,relationship pretty strongly in terms of
1:24:29.230,1:24:34.420,like your correspondence and your email
1:24:31.630,1:24:37.389,and stuff I had as that did you start
1:24:34.420,1:24:39.010,out writing regular letters with your
1:24:37.389,1:24:40.929,work and sending stuff back and forth
1:24:39.010,1:24:42.900,and then move to kind of considering it
1:24:40.929,1:24:45.639,via email you know this is abrupt shift
1:24:42.900,1:24:47.469,you mean when you're singing poles out
1:24:45.639,1:24:50.019,yeah well I mean like in your revision
1:24:47.469,1:24:51.429,process are do you have trusted readers
1:24:50.019,1:24:56.619,do you have people that are helping you
1:24:51.429,1:24:58.929,long ago and it's a bit like doing the
1:24:56.619,1:25:01.780,MFA program yeah like that there was
1:24:58.929,1:25:02.590,some groups of people who were like we
1:25:01.780,1:25:05.230,known each other
1:25:02.590,1:25:05.710,there was a little bit of that yeah not
1:25:05.230,1:25:08.559,so much
1:25:05.710,1:25:10.179,I have one very different Nancy Newton
1:25:08.559,1:25:12.489,who had been in the program with me she
1:25:10.179,1:25:16.539,also wrote fiction uh-huh and for a long
1:25:12.489,1:25:18.340,time every Sunday morning she was in she
1:25:16.539,1:25:21.789,moved in New Mexico we call each other
1:25:18.340,1:25:27.250,up and talk about poems uh-huh back and
1:25:21.789,1:25:30.159,forth and Rachel Logan is another person
1:25:27.250,1:25:33.360,that at times we exchange work she's
1:25:30.159,1:25:38.500,doing different kind of work now yeah
1:25:33.360,1:25:40.329,it's been a long sometimes I send stuff
1:25:38.500,1:25:42.520,to Denise know how long it's also
1:25:40.329,1:25:46.510,different
1:25:42.520,1:25:54.520,but more but mostly after it's almost
1:25:46.510,1:25:57.400,served very close so I I have and then I
1:25:54.520,1:25:59.410,have a friend in Ireland and my friends
1:25:57.400,1:26:01.810,that I correspond with but not in the
1:25:59.410,1:26:04.060,sense of sending homes which are being
1:26:01.810,1:26:05.950,paper letters and now husband knows the
1:26:04.060,1:26:07.930,planted by email yeah and as that
1:26:05.950,1:26:10.030,changed the kind of is that made any
1:26:07.930,1:26:14.980,difference to you it hasn't made a
1:26:10.030,1:26:20.020,difference in the friendships right and
1:26:14.980,1:26:25.030,the thing about the poems is that you
1:26:20.020,1:26:26.710,sees some people getting it give the
1:26:25.030,1:26:28.030,body back in the red version and so I'm
1:26:26.710,1:26:29.710,do you know yeah and then they're just
1:26:28.030,1:26:31.900,not going to get parts of dragon logic
1:26:29.710,1:26:34.950,and they're just not and and there's an
1:26:31.900,1:26:37.360,even stronger divide amongst people who
1:26:34.950,1:26:41.530,they just don't get in they don't want
1:26:37.360,1:26:46.510,to get electronic report that you break
1:26:41.530,1:26:50.860,and and I'm I have pretty much really
1:26:46.510,1:26:52.720,deeply in both worlds and yeah and and
1:26:50.860,1:26:55.870,they just don't get it I mean they don't
1:26:52.720,1:26:58.150,get each other and it's very hard with
1:26:55.870,1:27:00.400,the literature because it changes so
1:26:58.150,1:27:04.660,much then unless you're deeply in it
1:27:00.400,1:27:06.550,it's hard to learn it you know I mean it
1:27:04.660,1:27:09.340,really it takes a lot
1:27:06.550,1:27:11.140,that's probably think so if you didn't
1:27:09.340,1:27:14.140,if you're not already in the middle of a
1:27:11.140,1:27:16.480,net kind of life do you know which the
1:27:14.140,1:27:19.270,younger you are you are right great so
1:27:16.480,1:27:24.220,it's like I talked to lots of you yeah
1:27:19.270,1:27:26.470,it's great but my oh you know it sounds
1:27:24.220,1:27:27.910,like this sharp division right so it's
1:27:26.470,1:27:29.710,like it's not like you could really have
1:27:27.910,1:27:31.870,selfies all both these things are in
1:27:29.710,1:27:33.340,your mind it's not like so many people
1:27:31.870,1:27:35.380,you can go to because I'm not gonna get
1:27:33.340,1:27:36.850,half of it one way or another right yeah
1:27:35.380,1:27:43.570,though I think that the younger people
1:27:36.850,1:27:47.410,do get much more I mean I feel like no
1:27:43.570,1:27:49.150,oh do not have a cell phone and I must
1:27:47.410,1:27:50.920,be the only person than anybody knows
1:27:49.150,1:27:52.240,are very close to the only person
1:27:50.920,1:27:54.970,anybody knows who doesn't have a cell
1:27:52.240,1:27:58.390,phone and I get a lot of flack for it
1:27:54.970,1:28:00.700,you know but I just there's some things
1:27:58.390,1:28:01.000,I just take a stand against I mean I
1:28:00.700,1:28:05.140,don't
1:28:01.000,1:28:06.930,yeah the social media thing I understand
1:28:05.140,1:28:11.430,that there's some uses for it even
1:28:06.930,1:28:15.130,insofar as these people insofar as
1:28:11.430,1:28:18.100,parents holding their children's hands
1:28:15.130,1:28:20.800,or pushing a carriage are not responding
1:28:18.100,1:28:23.560,to that child's face I know that bothers
1:28:20.800,1:28:27.040,me so yeah I think that the way that a
1:28:23.560,1:28:28.090,face-to-face is cut off yeah I use
1:28:27.040,1:28:31.070,social media
1:28:28.090,1:28:34.520,I mean two people go to a restaurant and
1:28:31.070,1:28:38.180,and look at their votes you know anyway
1:28:34.520,1:28:40.790,I know that seems that seems a really
1:28:38.180,1:28:42.260,lost yeah it's very pronounced in New
1:28:40.790,1:28:43.550,York City I mean I've been noticing and
1:28:42.260,1:28:45.200,I mean well I've been here a day and I'm
1:28:43.550,1:28:46.460,just and I've been noticing it way more
1:28:45.200,1:28:49.220,than I do at last
1:28:46.460,1:28:54.980,yeah I don't know I'm also I see a lot
1:28:49.220,1:28:56.690,less people so well I've I decide with a
1:28:54.980,1:28:59.810,few more kind of questions I guess in
1:28:56.690,1:29:02.480,and these are kind of about like I'm not
1:28:59.810,1:29:04.430,feeling I guess but do you have I mean
1:29:02.480,1:29:06.260,do you have in terms of like the media
1:29:04.430,1:29:07.550,and the files that you've saved and
1:29:06.260,1:29:10.010,created over the years do you have sort
1:29:07.550,1:29:12.020,of dear feelings towards those do you
1:29:10.010,1:29:13.880,have like or do you I mean like what is
1:29:12.020,1:29:15.530,the work I guess is the question I mean
1:29:13.880,1:29:17.570,like where where is it in what do you
1:29:15.530,1:29:34.720,feel like protective of or do you feel
1:29:17.570,1:29:37.829,protective of anything yeah
1:29:34.720,1:29:37.829,[Music]
1:29:38.330,1:29:45.170,yeah I really strongly feel the
1:29:43.090,1:29:46.930,limitations and it's about being
1:29:45.170,1:29:49.430,creative writer mm-hmm
1:29:46.930,1:29:52.460,because I do have a kind of a
1:29:49.430,1:29:55.580,three-dimensional vision or hope or wish
1:29:52.460,1:29:57.200,and I see it in digital art and I see it
1:29:55.580,1:30:00.770,in lots of projects
1:29:57.200,1:30:01.420,yeah and easily they could easily be
1:30:00.770,1:30:05.739,liver
1:30:01.420,1:30:09.280,to me and they're not yeah yeah but I
1:30:05.739,1:30:15.040,would never not want books you couldn't
1:30:09.280,1:30:16.449,see yeah where the were the minute you
1:30:15.040,1:30:18.100,start to do digital work there's a
1:30:16.449,1:30:20.440,certain way in the same way that if
1:30:18.100,1:30:22.420,you're a theater person that you have to
1:30:20.440,1:30:24.330,let something go even more than you let
1:30:22.420,1:30:26.590,her manage go go mmm
1:30:24.330,1:30:31.330,today's performance was today's
1:30:26.590,1:30:33.070,performance and that won't come back you
1:30:31.330,1:30:35.170,know even if you videotaped it it really
1:30:33.070,1:30:38.710,doesn't come back yeah that's what you
1:30:35.170,1:30:40.239,know videotape doesn't so so there's
1:30:38.710,1:30:42.850,something like that when you realize and
1:30:40.239,1:30:45.310,then realize that in fact no one may
1:30:42.850,1:30:47.860,ever read it the way you meant it to be
1:30:45.310,1:30:49.390,read dude because at least for my
1:30:47.860,1:30:51.070,generation everybody made their own the
1:30:49.390,1:30:52.960,interface there was no time to get
1:30:51.070,1:30:54.910,canonical interfaces for various kinds
1:30:52.960,1:30:56.620,of work yeah how Sean is didn't
1:30:54.910,1:31:01.150,precipitate out not enough time for all
1:30:56.620,1:31:06.460,that yeah and so there's a certain was
1:31:01.150,1:31:09.940,lost there right I have no idea do you
1:31:06.460,1:31:14.739,know what I think that the best way
1:31:09.940,1:31:19.630,probably at the moment to say digital
1:31:14.739,1:31:21.750,stuff is to have some video or something
1:31:19.630,1:31:23.880,if somebody using it plus
1:31:21.750,1:31:26.910,no to interview them about what they
1:31:23.880,1:31:31.350,intended or whatever save the code if
1:31:26.910,1:31:33.210,you can yeah and I mean emulation
1:31:31.350,1:31:37.940,migration all of it is so burdensome
1:31:33.210,1:31:41.790,yeah you know yeah really hard yeah um
1:31:37.940,1:31:43.620,on the other hand I do send some email I
1:31:41.790,1:31:45.210,have there's a few folders that I
1:31:43.620,1:31:48.410,designated to go to Duke like definitely
1:31:45.210,1:31:52.380,don't want all my email to go to do
1:31:48.410,1:31:54.750,great but it's very because you don't
1:31:52.380,1:31:56.670,even know I mean I also purge my email
1:31:54.750,1:32:01.380,do you know that that that does any good
1:31:56.670,1:32:03.090,but you know like I don't say uh but you
1:32:01.380,1:32:06.870,know I it's like so I tried to just keep
1:32:03.090,1:32:08.700,a working only working stuff and if it's
1:32:06.870,1:32:10.590,done he was gone
1:32:08.700,1:32:12.270,no I pay a price for that sometimes
1:32:10.590,1:32:14.400,because I might want to come go back and
1:32:12.270,1:32:18.030,look at it you know yeah but unbalanced
1:32:14.400,1:32:19.860,like file maintenance is huge mmm and I
1:32:18.030,1:32:21.750,want to be able to find what I need
1:32:19.860,1:32:24.000,well you see I do a lot of different
1:32:21.750,1:32:26.700,things and you have to find what I need
1:32:24.000,1:32:28.080,is already a problem great so I don't
1:32:26.700,1:32:29.850,want tons and tons and tons of stuff
1:32:28.080,1:32:31.770,around and I'm not like those you know I
1:32:29.850,1:32:38.760,got document every day of their life in
1:32:31.770,1:32:41.610,there right so I don't want that I would
1:32:38.760,1:32:43.350,hope that there's some place or memory
1:32:41.610,1:32:46.110,or some collection some server somewhere
1:32:43.350,1:32:48.510,yeah that some of this stuff can be seen
1:32:46.110,1:32:51.570,and saved in some form separately not
1:32:48.510,1:32:53.490,this whole idea this we signed up kind
1:32:51.570,1:32:55.320,of a race history all together and like
1:32:53.490,1:32:56.910,what is history and do you know like
1:32:55.320,1:33:00.060,yeah we're just nothing but I'm moving
1:32:56.910,1:33:03.650,front you know I think that's a huge
1:33:00.060,1:33:06.780,loss yeah so and I think I'm not
1:33:03.650,1:33:10.710,invested in people saving every revision
1:33:06.780,1:33:12.420,I'm not you know I mean in some cases it
1:33:10.710,1:33:15.270,might be interesting to see some of the
1:33:12.420,1:33:19.200,things but basically you know the books
1:33:15.270,1:33:20.760,yeah do you know yeah in the books and
1:33:19.200,1:33:22.860,notebooks between them I think would be
1:33:20.760,1:33:24.810,more interesting than seen any page of
1:33:22.860,1:33:27.830,theory do you know yeah I think that
1:33:24.810,1:33:30.830,seems very fetishistic to me yeah yeah
1:33:27.830,1:33:30.830,whatever
1:33:31.790,1:33:36.990,let's take the right thing turned out it
1:33:34.890,1:33:40.560,is like yes that opportunistic to you a
1:33:36.990,1:33:42.300,lot but it's yeah I think you can wait
1:33:40.560,1:33:46.350,overdo it and on the other hand I'm not
1:33:42.300,1:33:48.270,like whatever you know I am invested to
1:33:46.350,1:33:51.750,a debate oh yeah you ever work in a
1:33:48.270,1:33:55.650,librarian yeah and especially these
1:33:51.750,1:33:57.930,things that got saved that nobody wanted
1:33:55.650,1:34:00.360,at the time even later you were so glad
1:33:57.930,1:34:02.190,to find out did somebody say do you know
1:34:00.360,1:34:06.420,yeah I really appreciate that about
1:34:02.190,1:34:09.590,libraries - yeah and so people who want
1:34:06.420,1:34:09.590,to do that kind of work I
1:34:15.030,1:34:20.130,so I guess the last question but when
1:34:18.330,1:34:22.010,you send stuff to do click when you're
1:34:20.130,1:34:33.120,sending digital stuff how does that work
1:34:22.010,1:34:35.250,well we both changed unfortunately we'll
1:34:33.120,1:34:36.990,is just leaving to go to the Newbery so
1:34:35.250,1:34:40.440,the two guys that worked with so far ah
1:34:36.990,1:34:46.170,the first one left in that will have to
1:34:40.440,1:34:49.470,split the other one but yeah once a year
1:34:46.170,1:34:51.330,I tell them which emails Wow that's
1:34:49.470,1:34:52.890,right if they could do the email files
1:34:51.330,1:34:56.250,okay and then I
1:34:52.890,1:34:59.100,they have my they have their stuff
1:34:56.250,1:35:01.020,online yeah yeah so they've they've r5
1:34:59.100,1:35:06.540,that themselves are tired of that yeah
1:35:01.020,1:35:07.920,sounds okay nine I don't do I put a lot
1:35:06.540,1:35:10.230,of stuff in a box I sort of try to
1:35:07.920,1:35:14.430,include a paper that says very roughly
1:35:10.230,1:35:15.150,what's in here but I can't - do you know
1:35:14.430,1:35:17.580,- really
1:35:15.150,1:35:22.530,to go through it like something
1:35:17.580,1:35:24.150,something that's like it's that or see
1:35:22.530,1:35:27.000,my grandchildren or do you know know

1:35:30.150,1:35:39.330,an indication but it's not wonderful but
1:35:36.020,1:35:40.539,anyway and for what I was good for a
