6,
7,NV I've been in this area since 1990.,

9,DB: OK,
10,
11,NVW: But my husband and I just moved out here to this little condo in '07,

13,"DB: OK, and by the way, it's a beautiful, beautiful view of the lake.",
14,
15,"OK, so here's the sort of digital and physical sort of question, but&#8230; So, what genres do you work in as a writer?",
16,
17,"NVW: Poetry, primarily, but also I write short stories.",

19,DB: What kinds of devices do you own or have access to for writing?,
20,
21,"NVW: Well, for writing&#8230; Electronic devices, you mean?",
22,
23,"DB: Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean.",
24,
25,"NVW: Yeah, I work on 3 different computers. This big iMac here that I use and then I have a laptop Mac, and then I also have an iPad.",
26,
27,"DB: OK, and you write on the iPad?",
28,
29,NVW: I have a keyboard extension for it.,
30,
31,DB: And what program do you use to write in? Do you just write in like notes or&#8230;?,
32,
33,NVW: I use Pages on the app,

36,
37,"NVW: I email it to myself, and then I move it in to Word.",
38,
39,DB: OK-,
40,
41,NVW: I use that one when I'm on the road.,
42,
43,"DB: When you're on the road, it's just the iPad&#8230;?",
44,
45,NVW: Yeah,
46,
47,DB: And you're on the road quite a bit?,
48,
49,NVW: When I go to Vermont-,
50,
51,"DB: OK, when you go to Vermont-",
52,
53,NVW: --when I'm doing any kind of traveling,
54,
55,DB: You don't travel with the laptop. You just travel with the iPad?,
56,
57,"NVW: Yeah, I don't really take the laptop with me. I have an older laptop and it's pretty heavy.",
58,
59,"DB: Yeah, they seriously are.",
60,
61,"OK, So you have 3 devices. And you are a Mac user?",
62,
63,"NVW: Yeah, I'm clueless with PC-clueless.",

68,
69,DB: That iMac?,
70,
71,NVW: Uh-hmm,
72,
73,"DB: OK, and then so, how do you&#8230; (You sort of said this but) How do you manage your files between your devices? You email them to yourself?",
74,
75,"NVW: Yes. With the iPad I email files to myself (Do I do it any other way?). With the laptop, I have put things on a memory stick and moved things back and",
76,"forth that way. When I have to give a presentation in Vermont and I have been doing a lot of powerpoint things lately with art, text and art. I bring a"
77,memory stick and use that to set up at the college. They have all good Macs and a good tech person who will help me get set up.
78,
79,"DB: So for your work, now, do you work exclusively on computers, or do you kind of go between the physical and digital environments at all?",
80,
81,"NVW: I work in longhand, on yellow legal tablets, or just whatever. I have different notebooks that I have. That's what all these notebooks are here; these",
82,are my various writing projects in process. They each get their own little notebook.
83,
84,"I worked longhand for&#8230; Gosh, I don't know-at least 3 or 4 more drafts, at least. Sometimes more like 10 or 12. It just depends. Some things give me",
85,more groove than others before I will type something.
86,
87,DB: And we're going to come back to that.,
88,
89,NVW: OK,
90,
91,DB: What's the transition from the notebook into the digital? Do you type it out yourself?,
92,
93,NVW: Yeah.,
94,
95,"DB: OK, and is that a moment of revision for you usually, or is it--?",
96,
97,"NVW: Yeah, yeah",
98,
99,"DB: OK, and &#8230;",
100,
101,"NVW: And then once I get it in to a document, I'll probably revise it again a number of times.",
102,
103,DB: OK,
104,
105,NVW: I'm doing different revision operations (Maybe we're going to go with this?),
106,
107,"DB: We're definitely going to talk about revision more in depth. Yeah, that sort of like locating the practice now and then we'll see where we're at with",
108,"that. So, these are the questions that, professionally, I'm interested in."
109,
110,"So, how do you then save these notebooks in your pre-writing and all that? I mean, is there a&#8230; Do you just keep them in a box somewhere, or&#8230;?",
111,
112,NVW: This is 'they.',
113,
114,"DB: This is it, OK. But like your older ones, like ones with finished projects?",
115,
116,NVW: They're all down there on a shelf.,
117,
118,DB: They're all down there on a shelf?,
119,
120,NVW: Yeah,
121,
122,"DB: OK, and then for your extra digital files, how do you save those? Do you save them just as Word docs?",
123,
124,"NVW: Yeah, I save them as Word docs and then when I'm done with them and the books are published, then I just put them on a back-up disk and take them off",
125,my hard drive here.
126,
127,"DB: OK, do you print out your writing to revise it?",
128,
129,"NVW: Often when it gets to the computer stage, not so much.",
130,
131,DB: OK,
132,
133,NVW: I'm just working on the screen for quite a while.,
134,
135,"DB: And then a sort of last section on this is: how do you back up your work and (as you say) when you're finished with something, you put it on an",
136,external hard drive. Is that your digital archival back-up?
137,
138,NVW: Right,
139,
140,"DB: OK, and you don't use any Cloud-based systems like Dropbox or Google Drive, or anything like that?",
141,
142,"NVW: Yeah, I do use Dropbox but&#8230; Not really so much for backup, but to send things to people.",
143,
144,"DB: To send things and share things, and...",
145,
146,NVW: Yeah,
147,
148,"DB: OK, are files saved in more than one location then?",
149,
150,"NVW: Well, I do have a back-up drive and-",
151,
152,"DB: So, on the hard drive on the computer and then in the back-up drive as well?",
153,
154,NVW: Yeah,
155,
156,"DB Do you keep print copies of your final drafts, or&#8230;?",
157,
158,"NVW: Oh, yeah",
159,
160,"DB: OK, so that you have a paper archive as well?",
161,
162,NVW: Yes,
163,
164,"DB: What do you do? How do you keep that? Just in the boxes like the notebooks kind of, or&#8230;?",
165,
166,"NVW: Yeah, they're usually with the notebooks. I just, once I print them out, I do some final kind of tinkering usually with the galleys. I'll keep a copy",
167,"of the galleys when they book's actually coming out, and that gets filed with the notebooks then-when I'm done with it."
168,
169,"DB: OK, and this is kind of just a quick question from me, personally, and librarians but&#8230; Have you ever received or sort out information about",
170,"methods for digital archiving activities, like best practices?"
171,
172,NVW: No,
173,
174,"DB: No, OK. And would you be interested in information about that?",
175,
176,"NVW: You know, maybe. I was thinking about that the other day. A couple of&#8230; I was thinking about making a book of selected stories from my 4 books of",
177,stories--
178,
179,"DB: Oh, yeah",
180,
181,"NVW: --And realizing that my first 2 books of stories, I don't know if I can access the computer files of them anymore. They're like on floppy disks, or",
182,"zip-disk, or something."
183,
184,"DB: Oh, yeah. A zip-disk",
185,
186,"NVW: I don't know if I could. You know? Does that mean I'm going to have to retype those suckers, or what?",
187,
188,DB: There's usually a way to get them,
189,
190,"NVW: Yeah, if I could even find them.",
191,
192,"DB: Yeah, yeah. So, there's always that question",
193,
194,"NVW: There's that, yes. You know, when we moved out here&#8230; Yeah, so that would be a major task-to locate and &#8230; So, I could probably use some",
195,help with that
196,
197,"DB OK, yeah, and that's definitely something typical of that period, especially the 90s with all the different word processing softwares and all the",
198,"different ways of saving them sort of put people Yeah, what do you do?)'"
199,
200,SEGMENT: 8:45,
201,
202,"So, that was a sort of quick beginning",
203,
204,NVW: OK,
205,
206,DB: (I'm just going to check this to make sure&#8230; It looks like&#8230;),
207,
208,"DB: How Long have you been writing in a more professional capacity, in a way that was sort of feeding you or giving you some sort of assistance&#8230;?",
209,"When do think that you started writing as a vocation? Or as something that led to something that would be your vocation, which is probably teaching?"
210,
211,NVW: I guess since graduate school. I went to graduate school and I thought I would just do that for a year that was my plan. I would go to graduate school,
212,in creative writing for a year and then I would go to medical school. I had been a pre-med major all through college but when I got to graduate school I
213,was totally happy doing my writing thing and I never looked back. So I started my so-called practice there where I worked every day on my writing. That was
214,1975
215,
216,DB: And where was that?,
217,
218,NVW: I went to the University of Denver.,
219,
220,DB: And was that a one year program?,
221,
222,NVW: No I actually stayed the regular two years.,
223,
224,DB: So you stayed 2 years and got your mfa. My next question is how would you describe the arc of your career? Where went from there and then elaborate?,
225,
226,"NVW: From there, I taught. I got my first teaching job at Marymount College of Kansas, now defunct. So I taught there for three years and then I got a job",
227,"at Lake Forest College, which is just north of Chicago, and I taught there for 11 years, and then I came out here in 1990, and I've been here ever since."
228,
229,DB: And you retired from ..,
230,
231,"NVW: I retired from Eastern (Washington) in '07, but I'm continuing to teach at Vermont College.",
232,
233,SEGMENT: 11:12 Poetry Writing,
234,
235,"DB: So now we're going to get to the specific writing practices generally, and I have it delimited into three stages: a drafting/prewriting/notebook stage,",
236,"and then an organizational stage, and then an archival/storage stage. And I'd like to go through and ask you about your practices by stage, and talk about"
237,those stage by stage.
238,
239,NVW: That makes sense.,
240,
241,DB: I'd like to start by talking about the ways you draft and create your work initially. So what is your typical compositional practice? And what I'm,
242,"interested in here is, when you first started writing how were you generating and composing your writing at that point?"
243,
244,"NVW: So yeah, early on - one of the things that's different now- is that early on I would probably just work on ""a"" poem, so I would write. I would have a",
245,"page in my notebook, and there were lines, and I would move things around on the page, and then I would have another page in the notebook with a different"
246,"poem. But over the years I've started working on maybe two or three poems almost kind of simultaneously, on the same page, which feels kind of nutty, but"
247,"what I was experiencing that led me this way was that a lot of times things would be coming to me - images, lines --- that didn't seem to belong to the"
248,poem I thought I was working on. So I realize it might be helpful to not confine myself. So that's why that was one of the main transitions. I think that
249,happened maybe half-way along. In the late-eighties or so I started experimenting with that and I liked it. I liked having just a page with a poem going
250,"down one margin, and another going down another margin, and one going across the bottom. Something like that."
251,
252,DB: On one notebook page?,
253,
254,"NVW: Yeah, on one page. And then a lot of times what would happen is - I didn't like one or two or all three of them, and eventually one of those poems",
255,would kind of gel and get its own page.
256,
257,DB: It's own page in the notebook?,
258,
259,NVW: Yeah.,
260,
261,"DB: Could you put that at a certain book, or was that just sort of gradual?",
262,
263,NVW: I think where I really started experimenting with that was a book called Beside Ourselves.,
264,
265,DB: That was 2003 or something,
266,
267,"NVW: Yeah, that was really also the first book that was more a deliberate series.",
268,
269,"DB: Yeah, I think I kind of figure out where that happened, and see that.",
270,
271,NVW: And then I liked that. I like working in series so much when I was writing that book that I also just decided I wanted to keep moving in that,
272,direction. I liked those series poems. And they maybe leant themselves more to that practice with several poems happening at the same time in early draft
273,stages.
274,
275,SEGMENT: 15:10 Fiction Writing vs. Poetry Writing,
276,
277,DB: How is that different than your fiction writing?,
278,
279,"NVW: I don't really see a lot of similarities between writing stories and writing poems in terms of the drafting process &#8230; well, in terms of",
280,"anything. Stories are really different. One of the first things I learned about writing stories in the drafting process is ""oh! it kind of helps to know a"
281,"few things about what happens in this story"" unlike a poem where you're just kind of launching into the unknown. It seemed helpful to have a few scenes in"
282,"mind. What some of the lines of tension, story lines, almost, not an outline, but I would often write down four or five sentences that would later become"
283,scenes.
284,
285,DB: And that would happen in the notebook?,
286,
287,NVW: Yeah. Or just a scrap of paper in the car when I'm driving.,
288,
289,D; And then did you grab those scraps of paper and put them in a notebook. Did you accumulate that detritus of composition &#8230;,
290,
291,NVW: Once I write the scene I throw out the piece of paper.,
292,
293,DB: So it's gone. That's gone.,
294,
295,NVW: But then my process in making stories would be - I try to write a scene a day or so in the initial drafting phase and then I just try to stay with,
296,"that scene. Blow out the edges. Often it's like three times as long as it's going to actually be in the final story. Usually compressing, compressing,"
297,"compressing, but initially I kind of move around, see what's happening in the periphery, sort of stay in one scene at a time and I don't worry about the"
298,order. I'm not writing the first scene first. I often start with the middle scene. I kind of know I'm writing the middle scene. I move around the
299,chronology of the story because I have these lists. And often when I'm working on one scene I think of another scene and then I'll just write it on another
300,"sheet of paper, again, a sentence that'll prompt me so I don't forget. The process is very different [from writing poems]. When a story is happening, when"
301,"I'm getting an early draft. It comes really fast. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. Because it takes all my time. I've been known to cancel classes - I'll"
302,say I'm sorry I can't come in today.
303,
304,DB: That's dedication.,
305,
306,NVW: Because I feel like I'm going to lose it.,
307,
308,"DB: So when you said it's happening it feels like it's come to you, and it's not inspiration, it's accumulation?",
309,
310,NVW: So much is going on. I go out and I take a walk every afternoon in this park. It's actually part of my writing process. I take a walk in the,
311,"afternoon, and it's like 'shut up' I'm just trying to take a walk!' People are talking in my head. It feels like this overpowering thing when I'm working"
312,on a story. It just comes over me and wakes me up in the morning. People wake me up in the morning. They are chattering away. It's very unnerving. I often
313,push back at a story until I am really sure that I have quite a few of the building blocks in place. Because otherwise it just seems like a struggle and a
314,fight. And it's going to occupy - it takes me like 10 ten-hour days in a row for a story.
315,
316,DB: And this is all hand-written too?,
317,
318,NVW: Yes.,
319,
320,DB: Does your hand cramp up?,
321,
322,NVW: No.,
323,
324,DB: I guess your thinking and then you're writing down and then you're thinking.,
325,
326,NVW: Yeah. I don't know about the hand but the brain ..,
327,
328,"And then, it's so much&#8230; Because I don't&#8230; I don't know how other writers do this but because I'm not writing the scenes in order, I'm kind of",
329,deliberately writing them out of order. I write the scene I see most clearly in my mind first and I'm not worrying about where it's going to go. Then I
330,just put the whole thing away for a long time-that initial mess of a draft-and worry later about kind of arranging the scenes. I'm often moving things
331,around not based on when they happened but what's more interesting to come next.
332,
333,"DB: OK, and so when did&#8230; Were you studying fiction as well as poetry in your graduate school? When did you start to write these stories?",
334,
335,"NVW: I did take up a fiction writing class in grad school. I was in the poetry group but we had to take a fiction class, and I was terrible. I was terrible",
336,"at it because I didn't have any sense of what made a story. But when I started teaching, especially when I moved to Lake Forest College, they thought,"
337,"well any poet can teach fiction writing. It's debatable if we can get a fiction writer who can teach poetry. So, they hired thinking that I could figure"
338,it out.
339,
340,"So, I think I just accidentally taught myself to write fiction by trying to help my students make their stories better and trying to diagnose: 'What does",
341,this story need?'
342,
343,I remember so many days walking to my fiction writing class and trying to think about what I was going to say to this writer about her story-how to address,
344,"its troubles-and I realized that I was internalizing all of this. And then the first time I got a sabbatical, I remember I was driving into Chicago for a"
345,"little adventure for the day (and I was so happy I had this sabbatical I was going to work on poems, of course) and I got this idea for a story. I remember"
346,"I was just writing on my car seat while I'm driving-just this little note to myself about what the story-kind of just a synopsis, like one sentence of what"
347,"it would be. By the time I got in to Chicago, I had 5 story synopses written on this piece of paper, and then I just came home. That's what I did for my"
348,"whole sabbatical-I wrote a bunch of stories and that was the 1st book of stories. Limited Lifetime Warranty, it was called."
349,
350,"DB: Yeah, and what year was that?",
351,
352,NVW: I think that was like 1983 or so.,
353,
354,"DB: OK, and so you've been&#8230; Stories kind of happened to you. And they've been similar the whole time that you've been writing?",
355,
356,NVW: Uh-hmm',
357,
358,SEGMENT: 23:00 The Daily Process/Practice of Writing Poems,
359,
360,"DB: Have poems, in similar ways, come upon you? Or is it a different process than that?",
361,
362,"NVW: Poems are more like a daily practice for me. I like poems. They don't&#8230; For me, they're more about sound and imagery, voice. Who's talking in my",
363,"poems-They're often some part of me that I didn't really know it was there. You know, some aspect of personality that I'm kind of exploring who uses a"
364,language a different way maybe than my ordinary daily life self.
365,
366,"So, I like that kind of quick pop of a poem.",
367,
368,"DB: Do you start mostly with a line or an image, or does it change?",
369,
370,NVW: I like a line with an image in it.,
371,
372,DB: OK,
373,
374,"NVW: I like&#8230; One time I was writing an article about Charles Wright's poetry (I really like Charles Wright), and I said something in there in the",
375,"review about: ""the hand of the image in the glove of sound."" I took that out of the review because I thought that sounded a little precious or something,"
376,but for me I like that kind of thought&#8230; They're sort of indivisible.
377,
378,They come together.,
379,
380,But I remember talking to Charles one time and I asked him a lot of the same questions you're asking me about composition because I was taking him to the,
381,"airport after our reading and I'm plugging him for everything he can tell me about how he works. He says, 'Well, you know, after I do 3 or 4 drafts then"
382,I'll turn it over to my ear.'
383,
384,I liked that.,
385,
386,"He said, 'I drive around town and do errands-go in the store, stuff like that and I memorize the poem I'm working on and then I just start moving the words",
387,"and the lines around, and then I start moving the lines and the stanzas around. Just kind of trying to figure out. I'm listening to the sonic values."
388,
389,I liked that. I'm doing that.,
390,
391,SEGMENT: 25:40 REVISION,
392,
393,"DB: So, I guess that's a good space to move on to revision. I mean, so when you're revising a poem, are you revising mostly by sound, or the sonic values,",
394,or are there different stages?
395,
396,"NVW: Well, you know, every poem just presents different troubles to me. I guess these are some of the questions I have to ask myself (but this is just for",
397,"me. I don't know that these would be other people's problems by any means but). I'm asking myself, 'Who the heck is talking at this part? Who is this"
398,"person?' Because sometimes I just- And I mean that in a physical, literal way. I have to see a figure almost. You know, maybe it's me, but it's me when I'm"
399,"12, or it's me with big, red hair."
400,
401,"So, I'm asking: Who is this person? Where is she, or he-sometimes I think I'm in a kind of gender shift. I like that because I was a real tomboy as a",
402,"little kid. I think I kind of squashed that little tomboy down and he likes to come back and say things once in a while. He's a little bit of a sassy,"
403,snotty kid. And I like him!
404,
405,"So, who is she; where are we in the poem? I need to get located in time and space. And what the heck is going on? What dramatically is happening in the",
406,poem? A lot of times I'll have a fix on one or the other of these questions and am really feeling unclear about the others.
407,

580,
581,
582,DB: I guess a couple more questions about revisions. One of the like&#8230; I've been reading this book called The Work of Revision which is really an,
583,"interesting book kind of tracing the history of revision from the Romantic up to the Modernist Period, and then kind of like how textual criticism works"
584,"with it. She was&#8230; Her name&#8230; Hannah Sullivan wrote it, and she was sort of delineating kind of three modes of revision. One being a creative or"
585,"additive, like Joyce adding all this stuff to Ulysses, and then this sort of excisive or subtractive way that you seem to do, and then there's that sort of"
586,substitution. And I'm wondering is there a primary mode between those three that you used for your revision or is it a combination?
587,
588,"NVW: I would say I really kind of start with the accretion first, and then go in to the subtraction. And then probably this substitution is like a",
589,tinkering I do at the very end.
590,
591,"DB: OK, and physically, where do these processes happen? I mean, when you're taking something away, does that happen in the notebook, or does that happen",

596,DB: OK,
597,
598,"NVW: So, I probably-as I said, I probably do 2 or 3 handwritten drafts and I'll actually rip the notebook page out. I have notebooks and notebooks where I",
599,"have a big X through the page so that I do not get confused that I'm actually done with this version, and now if I look hard enough in the notebook, there"

1450,
1451,DB: Yeah,

1467,"that's what they're missing, that sort of hand-eye coordination."
1468,
1469,NVW: I don't know. I don't think they necessarily are missing it. I think they've probably learned or are learning to do a step in the composing process.,
