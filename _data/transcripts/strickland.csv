,Stephanie Strickland:,So these are the questions?,,,,,
,DB:,"Yeah, these are the questions and it's pretty open-ended. There are sort of a couple of parts to it. The first part is the very sort of meant to be quickly going through your current practices for your digital files. It's a survey that I've done online with a bunch of emerging writers, and that I'm asking all the participants in this as well, and then we'll talk kind of specifically about your writing processes for probably the majority. There are questions about computing and computers. Usually we cover those, but sometimes, I go through those a little bit too if we have gone through those things and I want to ask a few more. Does that sound okay? Do you have to go somewhere or anything? Everyone has been an hour and fifteen to an hour and forty-five, right in there. So if you would please state for the recording devices your name and our location.",,,,,
,SS:,"It's Stephanie Strickland, New York City.",,,,,
,DB:,"Okay. In this section, I ask what you write and what you use to write it. This is about how you compose currently. What genres do you write in?",,,,,
,SS:,"I do books of poetry and I write critical essays, and I write&#8212;I make&#8212;usually collaboratively born digital works.",,,,,
,DB:,Okay. Would you say you have a primary genre?,,,,,
,SS:,Poetry.,,,,,
,DB:,What kind of devices do you own or have access to for your writing?,,,,,
,SS:,"Pens, pencils. There's four computing devices in this one room. I keep an old XP machine going&#8212;with difficulty, these days. I liked Word 2003. I managed to get that and Word 2007 on that machine, and then I have a little small Acer, which is underneath there, which is actually probably the most advanced, but again, it's Word 2007 is on there that I write with, and it's for travel. And then since the last thing I made was an app for iPad, I was forced to buy an iPad&#8212;I had to show the thing on it!  So that's over there, a mini.",devices,,,,

,SS:,XP and Windows 7.,,,,,
,DB:,"Do you work on the different devices? And how do you work between&#8212;I guess, if you have all these devices, what is your style for going between them?",,,,,
[00:03:09],SS:,"Well, if I'm generating new material, I will certainly do a certain amount of writing by hand. I capture, at various points, the material in a word processing program. The one I work with most intuitively is Word 2003. I'm annoyed at all the extra ridiculous functionality.",,,189,,189

,DB:,Yeah.,,,,,
,SS:,"But nonetheless, it's not supported anymore as with so much of the software that I once used. So I capture it at different points, certainly capturing it online is much better for sharing it and editing it to a degree, but it's not particularly good for through-line.",,,,,
,DB:,What do you mean by that?,,,,,
,SS:,"Well, if you're writing something long with a complex argument, I think it's much easier to have it in front of you on paper and read it out, because it's very easy to go into a ""collage-y"" kind of style with stuff that's going to be published online. It's harder to get a really consecutive&#8212;long, consecutive argument made, I think, or a thought, and it's not fluid enough to do poetry. I mean, it restricts you way too much in terms of formatting compared to what you can do on a page by hand in terms of how you want to scratch things out or put something right in&#8212;",paper;printdig,,,,
[00:05:00],SS:,"there's no arrow, insert, none of that. So it's neither&#8212;so there's a loss from both perspectives, but obviously from the point of organizing it and sharing it and necessarily sending it on for publishing these days and everything, it has to be done in&#8212;yeah. Long, long ago, I got used to doing that. It took me a long time to get there, though, because I started on a manual typewriter and then getting an IBM typewriter was a big thing, you know.",paper; early,,300,,300
,DB:,Yeah.,,,,,
,SS:,"Just like I've used many, many writing technologies.",,,,,
,DB:,"I mean that's really the impetus for this. I was just thinking about the thing I did earlier, then I started thinking about writers like yourself who have been writing over this course&#8212;this is a very interesting time for writing poetry.",,,,,
[00:05:52],SS:,"Well, I need those little balls on the IBM Selectric. That was like this huge thing that you could erase with an erase thing, that you don't have to pull the page out and start all over again. On the other hand, there was a discipline about that. So each technology actually gave rise to a certain kind of poetry and a certain kind of mistake.

It can be stuff I wrote down at different times and happened to bring it together. And there were so many versions for a while, and then you sort of drown in versions and then you get tired of that. And then came the time when I decided I needed to use the back of everything, for ecological reasons. I really feel sorry for the people that do [study this later], because now there's a version of a thing and you look on the back and you have no idea when that thing on the back&#8212;I mean, if you think the front and the back were done at the same time, they never were.",paper; future;highlight,,,,

,DB:,"It sounds like you kind of write&#8212;in <em>Dragon Logic</em>, it isn't really individual works, it is a collection but it's also kind of, you know&#8212;and some of your other books as well&#8212;are not quite made of individual works, but then when you're working, when you move stuff over to the computer, do you&#8212;",mss,,,,
,SS:,"Well, what do you mean not made individual? I mean, there are individual poems, but they are related. There's a whole meaning to the book.",mss,,,,
,DB:,"Right, yeah and it just sounds like with your notebooks&#8212;I'm just interested in how you organize that once it moves on to a digital space?",mss,,,,
,SS:,"I'm really good at that. I do that for lots of other people's books, too. I see unities, I see structures. I think I think in structures. I wanted to be an architect at one time.",mss,,,,

,SS:,"&#8212; so that the structure is often what I see. Do you know? It resonates, there's some kind of resonance here. So I see that and then it becomes what's the best way in, but that's for print because then in a digital work, there's not an ""in"" in the same way, right? In other words, there's an access often to all parts of it at once, you know in some kinds though I generally provide a default path through as well as a more open thing. So I think that's probably why that kind of work was so interesting to me, starting with True North, which has those five integrally [related] poems&#8212;the True North poems are sort of used to divide up the book&#8212;but really, they are supposed to be at the center of a moving pole, like the sun going around, so...how do you tell where True North is?

,DB:,"Just in terms of the nitty gritty though, I mean like, when you have a file on the computer, what is it called? Is it called the title of the poem or do you have large files full of many things?",files,,,,
,SS:,"Well, at some point it's the name of the poem, or it's a name that references the name of the poem. For a long time, I will do revisions within that file with the date at the top of what&#8212;of which revision that is. Though, sometimes when I'm doing many, many revisions in one day, that gets a little lost. Then, at the point of a manuscript, there's a whole file that's an entire manuscript and those will have dates or something, you know, called ""1, 2, 3,"" or something.

I did send off things like the galleys and things, the manuscripts and stuff like that.

I mean, if I see a whole bunch of poems, I just&#8212;some people have a sense for that particular thing and some other people are different; their best thing is at the poem level or at some other level, critical level or whatever, but the place that I seem to operate pretty well is that putting the structure together thing.",mss;highlight,,,,

It's written so you can make sense of it from wherever you start. You'll have a different impression depending on where you start, and that was part of the point, right? But I think most people will read it straight through. Part of the point was like it's just impossible the number&#8212;and again, this is seeing things in the round sort of, that you read and you read and you read, or you have people who are supposedly sympathetic like Robert Coles, you know?

I know this is an abrupt shift, but&#8212;",,,,,

,DB:,"Right, right.",software;change,,,,
,SS:,"And I'm pretty much really deeply in both worlds, and they just don't get it.

You have to really&#8212;it takes a lot.

,DB:,Yeah.,,,,,

I mean, I feel like they and I are living in the same world more than&#8212;although, I do not have a cell phone, and I must be the only person that anybody knows (or very close to the only person anybody knows) who doesn't have a cell phone, and I get a lot of flak for it. But I just&#8212;there are some things I just take a stand against. The social media thing, I understand there are some uses for it, but insofar as these people&#8212;insofar as parents holding their children's hands or pushing a carriage are not responding to that child's face?",,,,,
,DB:,"It happens, I know. I know.",,,,,
,SS:,That bothers me.,,,,,
,DB:,Yeah.,,,,,
,SS:,So I think that the way that face-to-face is cut off by the use of social media? I mean two people go to a restaurant and look at their phones? You know?,,,,,
,DB:,I know.,,,,,
,SS:,That seems a real loss to me.,,,,,
,DB:,"Yeah. It's very pronounced in New York City. I mean, I've been noticing it&#8212;I've only been here a day and I've been noticing it way more than I do out West, but I don't know. Also, I see a lot less people.",,,,,
,SS:,"Yeah, right, right, right.",,,,,
,DB:,"So, I just have a few more questions, and these are kind of about&#8212;not feeling, I guess, but&#8212;do you have, in terms of the media and the files that you've saved and created over the years, do you have sort of dear feelings towards those? I mean, what is the work? I guess, is the question. Where is it? And what do you feel protective of, or do you feel protective of anything?",,,,,
,SS:,"Well, you're glad for books. Books are going to last longer than almost anything else, in the last 20 years.",printdig,,,,
,DB:,Yeah.,,,,,
,SS:,"I love books. I do love books. I really strongly feel the limitations insofar as being a creative writer, because I do have some kind of a three-dimensional vision or hope or wish and I see it in digital art and I see it in lots of projects. And they can easily be literary to me, and they're not.",printdig,,,,
[01:30:00],DB:,Yeah.,,,5400,,5400
,SS:,"But I would never not want books. You could see that. The minute you start to do digital work, there's a certain way&#8212;in the same way that, if you're a theater person&#8212;that you have to let something go. Even more than you let a manuscript go. Today's performance was today's performance, and that won't come back. Even if you videotaped it, it really doesn't come back. That's what, you know, plus, videotape does not&#8212;so there's something like that: when you realize, and then you realize that in fact, no one may ever read it the way you meant it to be read because, at least for my generation, everybody made their own interface, there was no time to get canonical interfaces for various kinds of work or, you know, genres didn't precipitate out&#8212;not enough time for all that. So there's a certain loss there, right?",printdig,,,,
[01:31:02],SS:,"I have no idea. I think that the best way probably at the moment to save digital stuff is to have some video or something of somebody using it, plus people's notes, interview them about what they intended or whatever, save the code if you can, and adding emulation migration. All of it is so burdensome, you know? It's really hard. On the other hand, I do send some email. There are a few folders that I've designated to go to Duke. I definitely don't want all my email to go to Duke, right? But it's very&#8212;because you don't even know&#8212;I mean, I also purge my email. Not that that does any good; but like I don't save, you know, but so I try to just keep working&#8212;only working stuff, and if it's done, it's gone. Now I pay a price for that sometimes because I might want to go back and look at it, you know, but on balance&#8212;like file maintenance is huge, and I want to be able to find what I need. You see, I do a lot of different things. So to find what I need is already a problem. So I don't want tons and tons and tons of stuff around and I'm not like those, you know, got to document every day of their life and their dry cleaning ticket and everything, I'm like, ""Christ!""

This whole idea, the signup kind of erase history altogether, and like&#8212;what is history? We're just nothing but a moving front. I think that's a huge loss, and I think&#8212;I'm not invested in people saving every revision. I'm not. Do you know? In some cases it might be interesting to see some of the things, but basically, the books&#8212;",future,,,,

I was good for a while, I sent a lot of stuff out, but getting the two books out and the things out, you get a little lull from that to then send the stuff.
