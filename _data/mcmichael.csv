Transferring Processes to Computer for Poems and Letters,0:50:13,"But I love how non-invasive this [the computer] is as a medium&#8212;not so much in terms of my being protected against being invaded by somebody else, but being able to say something (send somebody something here [on the computer]) and understand that they can open it when they want, and that it's not an imposition on them.",3013
