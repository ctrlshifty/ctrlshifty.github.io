0:00:00.000,0:00:09.480
sit in workshop two which is probably

0:00:05.220,0:00:14.639
stupid but then I don't lose my voice by

0:00:09.480,0:00:16.080
the end of the residency well yeah it

0:00:14.639,0:00:17.940
was that was one of the weird things

0:00:16.080,0:00:23.189
that really changed for me when I quit

0:00:17.940,0:00:27.289
teaching full-time was my vocal cords do

0:00:23.189,0:00:30.660
not get the kind of workout they used to

0:00:27.289,0:00:33.930
does that yes I kept thinking why am I

0:00:30.660,0:00:44.520
losing my voice and I got the only thing

0:00:33.930,0:00:56.940
I can figure out us is recording yes ooh

0:00:44.520,0:00:58.829
me me yeah I'm just going to go and then

0:00:56.940,0:01:01.410
the reason I kind of added that was this

0:00:58.829,0:01:02.670
is for DSLR apparently will go for like

0:01:01.410,0:01:04.650
twenty four minutes but then it fills up

0:01:02.670,0:01:07.979
for gigs I'm going to have to get like

0:01:04.650,0:01:16.680
at the restart efficiency so if I forget

0:01:07.979,0:01:19.700
to do that yeah the other one will be

0:01:16.680,0:01:19.700
justice for food

0:01:32.010,0:01:40.450
and so you know I kind of think that the

0:01:37.450,0:01:42.220
interview will be I mean I've really

0:01:40.450,0:01:44.410
pretty familiar right now with your work

0:01:42.220,0:01:46.030
but it's going to focus more on the

0:01:44.410,0:01:47.560
practice so it's not so much like I'm

0:01:46.030,0:01:49.180
not going to prompt you by book cause I

0:01:47.560,0:01:50.380
like kind of imagery or something that

0:01:49.180,0:01:53.710
you were doing certain parts of your

0:01:50.380,0:01:57.840
career but I just want you to kind of go

0:01:53.710,0:02:00.940
and forget whatever we can from that and

0:01:57.840,0:02:02.320
and think about practice and how it's

0:02:00.940,0:02:04.090
changed and all that sort of thing is

0:02:02.320,0:02:06.280
kind of mean that's a real focus but

0:02:04.090,0:02:08.470
anything you think of the time and if

0:02:06.280,0:02:10.090
you repeat yourself the time okay and if

0:02:08.470,0:02:11.500
I'm annoying or if you're definitely

0:02:10.090,0:02:13.840
like down with the questions like okay

0:02:11.500,0:02:16.810
let's go okay I mean you know I'm just

0:02:13.840,0:02:18.430
trying to throw everything out okay

0:02:16.810,0:02:39.610
first time and we'll see what see how it

0:02:18.430,0:02:42.370
goes okay okay yeah okay

0:02:39.610,0:02:52.090

okay so we'll get started so I have sort

0:03:13.150,0:03:15.670
of like a couple different sections of

0:03:14.560,0:03:18.310
interview questions that I'm going to

0:03:15.670,0:03:20.560
ask the first are based on a survey that

0:03:18.310,0:03:22.660
I did of other kind of more emerging

0:03:20.560,0:03:25.120

0:03:26.590,0:03:31.000
through it somewhat quickly and then

0:03:28.450,0:03:32.620
I'll ask you about your sort of practice

0:03:31.000,0:03:33.700
generally and how that's changed and

0:03:32.620,0:03:35.470
then I'll ask you a little bit about

least sometimes more like 10 or 12 it

0:07:37.759,0:07:43.849
just depends some things give me more

0:07:40.039,0:07:45.979
than others before I will type something

0:07:43.849,0:07:47.750

revision for you usually yeah okay yeah

0:07:57.560,0:08:09.529
okay and and then I'll probably revise

notebooks then when I'm done with it and

0:10:53.010,0:10:57.640
then the sort of over business and the

0:10:55.990,0:10:59.920
question for me personally am the

0:10:57.640,0:11:02.320
librarian said have you ever received or

0:10:59.920,0:11:04.660

digital archiving activity for like best

0:11:04.660,0:11:07.810
practices no okay

0:11:06.760,0:11:11.260
and when you'd be interested in

0:11:07.810,0:11:13.140
information about that or you know maybe

0:11:11.260,0:11:17.050
I was thinking about that the other day

0:11:13.140,0:11:21.040
a couple of I was thinking about making

0:11:17.050,0:11:24.850
of a book of selected stories from my

0:11:21.040,0:11:28.360
for books Astoria and realizing that my

0:11:24.850,0:11:31.360
first two books of stories I don't know

0:11:28.360,0:11:34.710
if I can access the computer files of

0:11:31.360,0:11:38.910
them anymore they're they're like on Oh

0:11:34.710,0:11:42.850

I just I don't know if I could yeah you

0:11:42.850,0:11:47.320

0:11:47.320,0:11:55.150
like yeah if I could even find them yeah

0:11:51.820,0:11:59.050
yes yeah there's that because you know

0:11:55.150,0:12:02.010
when we moved out here yeah so that

0:11:59.050,0:12:05.140
would be a major task to locate and

0:12:02.010,0:12:07.000
write so I could probably use some help

0:12:05.140,0:12:08.440
with that okay yeah I know that's and

0:12:07.000,0:12:10.780
that's definitely something that you

0:12:08.440,0:12:12.640
know that that kind of period especially

0:12:10.780,0:12:14.380
the 90s if it's all the different we're

0:12:12.640,0:12:16.360
probably a player and then all the

0:12:14.380,0:12:21.460
different ways of saving them right put

0:12:16.360,0:12:23.500
people in yeah when you do okay so that

0:12:21.460,0:12:24.790
was sort of the quick okay quick

0:12:23.500,0:12:27.210
beginning I'm just going to check this

0:12:24.790,0:12:27.210
is make sure

0:13:00.500,0:13:06.560
okay um that's working so we'll do a set

0:13:04.420,0:13:07.760
so this is going to be more about the

0:13:06.560,0:13:10.820
kind of overview of your writing

0:13:07.760,0:13:12.470
practices and generally and so the sort

0:13:10.820,0:13:14.300
of first couple questions are just sort

0:13:12.470,0:13:15.460
of broad and anything elaborate as much

0:13:14.300,0:13:17.930
there were as little as you'd like but

0:13:15.460,0:13:21.260
so how long have you been writing in a

0:13:17.930,0:13:24.230
more professional capacity and like in a

0:13:21.260,0:13:27.200
way that would sort of I don't know

0:13:24.230,0:13:29.000
feeding you or giving you some sort of I

0:13:27.200,0:13:30.410
mean even even if I can MFA might be a

0:13:29.000,0:13:32.480
kind of professional sort of like when

0:13:30.410,0:13:35.140
you think you started writing kind of

0:13:32.480,0:13:37.550
distant as years as your vocation

0:13:35.140,0:13:39.350
whereas something that led to something

0:13:37.550,0:13:44.720
that would be your vocation describe

0:13:39.350,0:13:48.920
teaching yeah no I I guess since

0:13:44.720,0:13:52.370
graduate school I went to graduate

0:13:48.920,0:13:55.280
school and I thought I would just do

0:13:52.370,0:13:57.080
that for a year that was my plan I would

0:13:55.280,0:13:59.750
go to graduate school and creative

0:13:57.080,0:14:02.300
writing for a year and then I would go

0:13:59.750,0:14:06.890
to medical school I had been a pre-med

0:14:02.300,0:14:09.940
major after college but when I got to

0:14:06.890,0:14:12.470
grad school I was just probably happy

0:14:09.940,0:14:16.040
doing my writing thing and I just I

0:14:12.470,0:14:18.980
never looked back so I just I worked I

0:14:16.040,0:14:21.380
started my so-called practice there

0:14:18.980,0:14:28.370
where I worked every day on my writing

0:14:21.380,0:14:30.380
and roof that was 1975 where was it I

0:14:28.370,0:14:32.810
went to the University Denver University

0:14:30.380,0:14:35.390
Denver I mean was that it one year

0:14:32.810,0:14:39.290
program yeah no I actually stayed the

0:14:35.390,0:14:41.870
regular two years stay - yeah and got

0:14:39.290,0:14:43.550
your anything and then so my uh my next

0:14:41.870,0:14:44.690
question is sort of like I'm interested

0:14:43.550,0:14:46.760
in kind of like how you would describe

0:14:44.690,0:14:48.500
the arc of your career like where you

0:14:46.760,0:14:51.440
went from there and just kind of a

0:14:48.500,0:14:52.760
general okay elaborate or as elaborate

0:14:51.440,0:14:56.840
as you want to be sort of background

0:14:52.760,0:14:59.390
there yeah and from there I taught for I

0:14:56.840,0:15:02.960
got my first teaching job at Marymount

0:14:59.390,0:15:04.970
College of Kansas now defunct okay

0:15:02.960,0:15:07.780
so I taught there for three years and

0:15:04.970,0:15:11.180
then I got a job at Lake Forest College

0:15:07.780,0:15:12.710
just north of Chicago and I cut there

0:15:11.180,0:15:17.060
for eleven years

0:15:12.710,0:15:19.220
and then I came out here in 1990 oh and

0:15:17.060,0:15:22.220
I've been here ever since and you can

0:15:19.220,0:15:25.610
you retired yeah I retired from Eastern

0:15:22.220,0:15:32.149
and oh seven okay but you're continuing

0:15:25.610,0:15:34.399
to teach and at Fermont College so so

0:15:32.149,0:15:36.620
now we're going to get kind of we've

0:15:34.399,0:15:38.240
always been nervous get to the kind of

0:15:36.620,0:15:39.770
specific writing practices sort of

0:15:38.240,0:15:41.690
generally and I have it kind of

0:15:39.770,0:15:44.420
delineated into kind of three stages a

0:15:41.690,0:15:47.180
sort of drafting prewriting notebook

0:15:44.420,0:15:49.600
stage and then a revision stage and then

0:15:47.180,0:15:52.700
a kind of organizational archival stages

0:15:49.600,0:15:54.470
and what I'd like to do is sort of go

0:15:52.700,0:15:55.970
stage by stage and ask you about kind of

0:15:54.470,0:15:58.370
your practices in the beginning and how

0:15:55.970,0:15:59.930
those have changed for each stage but if

0:15:58.370,0:16:02.089
that doesn't make sense to you we can do

0:15:59.930,0:16:05.240
it a different no I said that makes it

0:16:02.089,0:16:08.420
okay so uh I guess I'm I would like to

0:16:05.240,0:16:10.459
first start talking about sort of ways

0:16:08.420,0:16:14.750
you you draft and create your work

0:16:10.459,0:16:16.570
initially so what is your sort of

0:16:14.750,0:16:18.950
typical compositional practice

0:16:16.570,0:16:20.150
especially when you and I'm interested

0:16:18.950,0:16:21.920
right now and kind of like when you

0:16:20.150,0:16:25.490
first started writing how are you

0:16:21.920,0:16:35.240
generating and composing your writing at

0:16:25.490,0:16:39.080
that point so yeah early on I one of the

0:16:35.240,0:16:40.700
things that's different now it has been

0:16:39.080,0:16:46.820
for a long time early on I was probably

0:16:40.700,0:16:49.400
just work on a poem so I would you know

0:16:46.820,0:16:52.880
right I would have a page in my notebook

0:16:49.400,0:16:55.970
or whatever what's the blinds and move

0:16:52.880,0:16:57.620
things around on the page and then I

0:16:55.970,0:17:01.010
would have a another page in the book

0:16:57.620,0:17:05.630
with a different poem but over the years

0:17:01.010,0:17:09.709
I started working on maybe two or three

0:17:05.630,0:17:13.730
palms almost kind of simultaneously on

0:17:09.709,0:17:19.069
the same page which feels kind of nutty

0:17:13.730,0:17:21.169
but I was what I was experiencing that

0:17:19.069,0:17:25.980
kind of led me this way was that a lot

0:17:21.169,0:17:29.940
of times things would be coming to me

0:17:25.980,0:17:31.830
images lines that didn't seem to belong

0:17:29.940,0:17:35.580
to the poem I thought I was working on

0:17:31.830,0:17:40.350
and so I realized that it might be

0:17:35.580,0:17:43.080
helpful to us to not confine myself so

0:17:40.350,0:17:46.350
that's why that was one of the sort of

0:17:43.080,0:17:48.780
main transitions that I've noticed in my

0:17:46.350,0:17:51.960
I think that happened maybe you know

0:17:48.780,0:17:54.390
sort of halfway along okay maybe late

0:17:51.960,0:17:56.730
eighties or so I started experimenting

0:17:54.390,0:17:59.070
with that and I liked it yeah I liked

0:17:56.730,0:18:02.340
having just a page there'd be a poem

0:17:59.070,0:18:04.110
going down one margin and then maybe

0:18:02.340,0:18:06.840
done another margins and across the

0:18:04.110,0:18:10.200
bottom something like that on Island Oh

0:18:06.840,0:18:13.680
on it on one page and then a lot of

0:18:10.200,0:18:17.940
times what would happen is I did I

0:18:13.680,0:18:20.730
didn't like one or two or all three of

0:18:17.940,0:18:22.860
them and eventually maybe just one of

0:18:20.730,0:18:25.890
those poems would kind of gel and then

0:18:22.860,0:18:30.660
get it's all fake okay well I found out

0:18:25.890,0:18:32.760
in the notebook yeah okay and and that

0:18:30.660,0:18:34.380
and then so is that could you put that

0:18:32.760,0:18:39.480
in a certainty book or was that just

0:18:34.380,0:18:41.160
sort of gradual yeah I think I I really

0:18:39.480,0:18:44.640
started experimenting with that was a

0:18:41.160,0:18:46.110
book called beside ourselves just maybe

0:18:44.640,0:18:49.380
kind of in the middle somewhere there

0:18:46.110,0:18:52.530
yeah yeah that was really awesome maybe

0:18:49.380,0:18:55.020
the first book that was more kind of

0:18:52.530,0:18:57.270
deliberate series but yeah like I think

0:18:55.020,0:19:00.210
I can kinda she's letting I can kind of

0:18:57.270,0:19:03.390
figure out where that happened oh yeah

0:19:00.210,0:19:06.060
kind of like yeah and then I liked I

0:19:03.390,0:19:09.600
liked that I liked looking in series so

0:19:06.060,0:19:12.630
much when I was writing that book that I

0:19:09.600,0:19:14.130
also just decided that I wanted to keep

0:19:12.630,0:19:16.650
moving in that direction

0:19:14.130,0:19:18.930
I liked the series pause okay doing

0:19:16.650,0:19:20.700
those yeah yeah and they maybe learn

0:19:18.930,0:19:23.700
some self more to that kind of practice

0:19:20.700,0:19:25.920
with several palms kind of happening at

0:19:23.700,0:19:29.970
the same time in the early draft stages

0:19:25.920,0:19:34.610
yeah and then how is that different tuna

0:19:29.970,0:19:34.610
from your fiction right uh-huh yeah

0:19:35.210,0:19:41.990
I don't really see a lot of similarities

0:19:39.410,0:19:43.790
between writing stories and writing

0:19:41.990,0:19:48.070
poems in terms of the drafting process

0:19:43.790,0:19:53.060
well in terms of space okay

0:19:48.070,0:19:54.080
stories are really different and one of

0:19:53.060,0:19:55.910
the first things they learn about

0:19:54.080,0:20:00.260
writing stories in the drafting process

0:19:55.910,0:20:03.020
was oh it kind of helps to know a few

0:20:00.260,0:20:05.720
things about what's going to happen in

0:20:03.020,0:20:07.550
this story through not unlike a poem

0:20:05.720,0:20:08.710
where you're kind of launching into the

0:20:07.550,0:20:11.870
unknown

0:20:08.710,0:20:15.770
it seems helpful to have like a few

0:20:11.870,0:20:17.350
scenes in mind you know what some of the

0:20:15.770,0:20:19.970
lines of tension

0:20:17.350,0:20:26.120
storylines kind of have a few things

0:20:19.970,0:20:29.540
yeah almost not an outline but I often

0:20:26.120,0:20:31.130
had would writes down four or five kind

0:20:29.540,0:20:33.980
of sentences that would later become

0:20:31.130,0:20:35.810
scenes and that would be like on one

0:20:33.980,0:20:38.360
page of the notebook notebook or you

0:20:35.810,0:20:41.600
know just to scrap a paper in the car on

0:20:38.360,0:20:42.920
driving okay and yeah then you grab

0:20:41.600,0:20:44.660
those cotton paper and put them in the

0:20:42.920,0:20:46.280
notebook cause it become like does it

0:20:44.660,0:20:49.580
accumulate all your sort all that sort

0:20:46.280,0:20:51.260
of detritus of composition now once I

0:20:49.580,0:20:57.380
write the scene I throw the piece of

0:20:51.260,0:21:00.200
paper right yeah all right but the but

0:20:57.380,0:21:03.170
then I my process in making the stories

0:21:00.200,0:21:06.260
would be I write like I try to write a

0:21:03.170,0:21:10.400
scene a day or so in the initial

0:21:06.260,0:21:12.650
drafting phase and I just try to stay

0:21:10.400,0:21:14.660
with that scene and you know blow out

0:21:12.650,0:21:17.570
the edges often it's like three times as

0:21:14.660,0:21:22.250
long as what's going to actually be in

0:21:17.570,0:21:24.470
the final story okay usually I'm

0:21:22.250,0:21:26.960
compressing compressing compressing but

0:21:24.470,0:21:28.370
initially I just trying to look around

0:21:26.960,0:21:33.380
and see what's happening in the

0:21:28.370,0:21:35.900
periphery and just sort of stain once

0:21:33.380,0:21:37.640
one scene at a time and I don't worry

0:21:35.900,0:21:41.420
about the order I'm not writing the

0:21:37.640,0:21:43.160
first scene first I often write start

0:21:41.420,0:21:45.590
with the middle scene in fact I kind

0:21:43.160,0:21:47.460
know I'm writing the middle scene and

0:21:45.590,0:21:51.690
then I just I move

0:21:47.460,0:21:54.120
in the chronology of the story I because

0:21:51.690,0:21:55.980
I you know I have my little list and

0:21:54.120,0:21:57.570
often when I'm working on one scene I'll

0:21:55.980,0:21:59.130
think of another sin and I just write it

0:21:57.570,0:22:02.280
on another piece of paper like just

0:21:59.130,0:22:05.070
again a sentence settles kind of comment

0:22:02.280,0:22:08.820
yeah so I don't forget Oh what's up see

0:22:05.070,0:22:11.280
on this but so it's they're very the

0:22:08.820,0:22:13.800
process is really different it takes me

0:22:11.280,0:22:16.530
I like when a story is happening when

0:22:13.800,0:22:18.480
I'm getting that early draft comes

0:22:16.530,0:22:23.610
really fast I hate it I hate it I hate

0:22:18.480,0:22:26.550
it because it takes all my time I have

0:22:23.610,0:22:29.410
been known to cancel classes I'm sick

0:22:26.550,0:22:32.240
today sorry I can't come in today

0:22:29.410,0:22:35.610
[Laughter]

0:22:32.240,0:22:37.740
because I feel like I'm going to lose it

0:22:35.610,0:22:40.080
okay so I when you said it it's

0:22:37.740,0:22:42.000
happening it feels like like it's come

0:22:40.080,0:22:43.490
to you it's like I mean it's not like an

0:22:42.000,0:22:48.420
inspiration but it's just like

0:22:43.490,0:22:50.940
accumulation or so much is going on you

0:22:48.420,0:22:53.100
know I go out and I take a walk every

0:22:50.940,0:22:54.720
afternoon this apartment we actually

0:22:53.100,0:22:58.920
part my writing process to take a walk

0:22:54.720,0:23:01.860
in the afternoon and shut up I'm just

0:22:58.920,0:23:06.900
trying to walk the people are talking in

0:23:01.860,0:23:09.270
my head and so it's just it feels like

0:23:06.900,0:23:11.310
it's just kind of sits over powering

0:23:09.270,0:23:14.910
saying when I'm working on a story it

0:23:11.310,0:23:16.890
just comes over me and it wakes me up in

0:23:14.910,0:23:19.740
the morning people wake me up in the

0:23:16.890,0:23:22.370
morning they are chattering away is it

0:23:19.740,0:23:27.750
it's very unnerving

0:23:22.370,0:23:30.750
and I often push back at a story until I

0:23:27.750,0:23:32.820
am really sure that I have you know

0:23:30.750,0:23:36.120
quite a few of the building blocks in

0:23:32.820,0:23:38.700
place because otherwise it it just seems

0:23:36.120,0:23:41.460
like a struggle in a fight and it's

0:23:38.700,0:23:43.800
going to occupy it takes it takes me

0:23:41.460,0:23:48.210
about ten days of like ten hour days in

0:23:43.800,0:23:50.820
a row ten ten-hour day well it's for one

0:23:48.210,0:23:53.970
story for a story and this is all

0:23:50.820,0:23:58.170
hundred into yeah okay and it's just

0:23:53.970,0:24:00.140
incredible no I mean I'm I guess you're

0:23:58.170,0:24:04.070
saving a minute yeah I'm down

0:24:00.140,0:24:08.320
yeah but not with the hands with the

0:24:04.070,0:24:11.020
brains and then you know it's so much

0:24:08.320,0:24:13.520
because I don't I don't know how other

0:24:11.020,0:24:15.200
writers do this because I'm not writing

0:24:13.520,0:24:18.280
the scenes in order I'm kind of

0:24:15.200,0:24:21.110
deliberately writing them out of order

0:24:18.280,0:24:24.290
just I write the scene I see most

0:24:21.110,0:24:27.080
clearly in my mind first and not worry

0:24:24.290,0:24:29.240
about where it's going to go then then I

0:24:27.080,0:24:33.350
just put the whole thing away for a long

0:24:29.240,0:24:35.690
time that initial mess of a draft and

0:24:33.350,0:24:37.700
then worry later about kind of arranging

0:24:35.690,0:24:42.770
the scenes I'm often moving things

0:24:37.700,0:24:46.910
around not based on when they happened

0:24:42.770,0:24:48.620
but what's more interesting to come next

0:24:46.910,0:24:52.309
okay

0:24:48.620,0:24:54.169
and so when were you studying fiction as

0:24:52.309,0:24:56.360
well as poetry in your graduate school

0:24:54.169,0:25:00.350
or did when did you start to write these

0:24:56.360,0:25:02.750
stories well I was um I did take a

0:25:00.350,0:25:06.140
fiction writing class in grad school I

0:25:02.750,0:25:07.940
was in I was in the poetry group but we

0:25:06.140,0:25:11.990
had to take a fiction class and I was

0:25:07.940,0:25:13.760
terrible I was terrible at it because I

0:25:11.990,0:25:18.100
didn't have any sense of what made a

0:25:13.760,0:25:20.480
story yeah but when I started teaching

0:25:18.100,0:25:23.990
it's especially when I moved to Lake

0:25:20.480,0:25:26.419
Forest College I they thought well any

0:25:23.990,0:25:29.900
poet can teach fiction writing you know

0:25:26.419,0:25:31.460
it's debatable if we can get a fiction

0:25:29.900,0:25:34.280
writer who can teach poetry so they

0:25:31.460,0:25:37.390
hired thinking you know that I could

0:25:34.280,0:25:40.820
figure it out so I think I just

0:25:37.390,0:25:43.429
accidentally taught myself to write

0:25:40.820,0:25:46.280
fiction by trying to help my students

0:25:43.429,0:25:50.030
make their stories better and trying to

0:25:46.280,0:25:55.220
diagnose and what does this story need I

0:25:50.030,0:25:57.230
remember so many days walking to my

0:25:55.220,0:25:58.880
fiction writing class and trying to

0:25:57.230,0:26:02.030
think about what I was going to say to

0:25:58.880,0:26:04.460
this writer about her story you know how

0:26:02.030,0:26:08.540
to how to address its trouble

0:26:04.460,0:26:12.880
and I realized that I was internalizing

0:26:08.540,0:26:15.910
all of all this and then the first

0:26:12.880,0:26:19.420
time I got a sabbatical on I remember I

0:26:15.910,0:26:21.130
was driving into Chicago on a little for

0:26:19.420,0:26:23.170
a little adventure for the day and I'm

0:26:21.130,0:26:25.660
so happy I had the sabbatical I was

0:26:23.170,0:26:29.590
going to work on poems of course and I

0:26:25.660,0:26:32.080
got this idea for a story and I wrote I

0:26:29.590,0:26:32.920
remember I was just writing on my car

0:26:32.080,0:26:35.610
see fine

0:26:32.920,0:26:38.440
driving this this little note to myself

0:26:35.610,0:26:40.660
about what the story kind of just a

0:26:38.440,0:26:43.540
synopsis like one sentence of what it

0:26:40.660,0:26:48.670
would be by the time I got into Chicago

0:26:43.540,0:26:50.890
I had five story synopses written on

0:26:48.670,0:26:52.960
this piece of paper well and then I just

0:26:50.890,0:26:56.110
came home and that's when I did from my

0:26:52.960,0:26:58.960
own radical I will I will a bunch of

0:26:56.110,0:27:01.950
stories analysis first book of stories

0:26:58.960,0:27:06.730
limited lifetime warranty is called yeah

0:27:01.950,0:27:14.590
and what year was it oh my gosh I think

0:27:06.730,0:27:15.010
that was 1983 yourself and so so

0:27:14.590,0:27:18.400
southern

0:27:15.010,0:27:19.720
Anna's and so you've been stories kind

0:27:18.400,0:27:21.640
of happened to you and they've done

0:27:19.720,0:27:25.270
they've been similar as a whole time in

0:27:21.640,0:27:27.250
writing have poems in similar ways had

0:27:25.270,0:27:29.320
like kind of come upon you or is it a

0:27:27.250,0:27:31.690
little bit more I don't know is it a

0:27:29.320,0:27:34.930
different process than that holes are

0:27:31.690,0:27:42.160
more like a daily practice with me I

0:27:34.930,0:27:48.180
like I like poems they don't form either

0:27:42.160,0:27:51.400
more about sound and imagery voice who's

0:27:48.180,0:27:58.000
talking in my poems there's there often

0:27:51.400,0:28:03.460
some part of me that I didn't really

0:27:58.000,0:28:06.150
know was there you know some aspect of

0:28:03.460,0:28:09.130
personality that I'm kind of exploring

0:28:06.150,0:28:12.690
yeah who uses language a different way

0:28:09.130,0:28:17.110
maybe than my ordinary daily life self

0:28:12.690,0:28:22.540
so I like I like that kind of quick pop

0:28:17.110,0:28:24.730
of a poem and you start mostly with the

0:28:22.540,0:28:32.330
line or name

0:28:24.730,0:28:36.770
I like a line with an image in it okay I

0:28:32.330,0:28:39.350
like one time I was writing an article

0:28:36.770,0:28:42.080
about Charles writes poetry I really

0:28:39.350,0:28:44.510
like Charles Wright and I said something

0:28:42.080,0:28:49.250
in there and yes with you about the hand

0:28:44.510,0:28:52.549
of the image in the glove of sound and I

0:28:49.250,0:28:54.169
took that out over the review because I

0:28:52.549,0:28:57.289
thought it sound a little precious or

0:28:54.169,0:29:00.470
something but it reduces yeah

0:28:57.289,0:29:03.649
but for me I like that kind of fear sort

0:29:00.470,0:29:11.929
of in sort of indivisible great right

0:29:03.649,0:29:14.450
they come together but I'm I'm I

0:29:11.929,0:29:16.970
remember talking to Charles one time and

0:29:14.450,0:29:19.850
I asked him a lot of the same questions

0:29:16.970,0:29:22.130
you're asking me about composition I was

0:29:19.850,0:29:24.860
just like taken aback to the airport

0:29:22.130,0:29:26.480
after a reading I like plug in him for

0:29:24.860,0:29:28.399
everything you can tell me about how he

0:29:26.480,0:29:31.850
works and he says well you know after I

0:29:28.399,0:29:37.520
do it to your fourth draft and I I turn

0:29:31.850,0:29:39.679
it over to my ear yeah he said I drive

0:29:37.520,0:29:42.289
around town doing errands going to

0:29:39.679,0:29:44.659
stores stuff like that and I memorized

0:29:42.289,0:29:47.510
the poem and working on and then I just

0:29:44.659,0:29:50.390
start moving the words in the lines

0:29:47.510,0:29:52.370
around and then I start moving the lines

0:29:50.390,0:29:54.500
and the stances around just kind of

0:29:52.370,0:30:00.200
trying out I'm listening to the sonic

0:29:54.500,0:30:02.630
value I'm doing that so I guess that's a

0:30:00.200,0:30:04.490
good space to move on to review I mean

0:30:02.630,0:30:08.990
so when you're revising a poem are you

0:30:04.490,0:30:11.090
revising mostly by sound or I mean it's

0:30:08.990,0:30:17.210
like the sonic values is that where are

0:30:11.090,0:30:20.110
there different stages well you know

0:30:17.210,0:30:25.880
every poem has just presents different

0:30:20.110,0:30:27.890
troubles to me I guess these are some of

0:30:25.880,0:30:29.539
the questions I have to ask myself if

0:30:27.890,0:30:31.070
this is just for me I don't know that

0:30:29.539,0:30:34.970
these would be other people's problems

0:30:31.070,0:30:36.320
by any means but I'm asking myself who

0:30:34.970,0:30:41.010
the heck is talking

0:30:36.320,0:30:44.940
who is it because sometimes I just and I

0:30:41.010,0:30:48.450
mean that in a physical literal way I

0:30:44.940,0:30:51.540
have to see I have to see a figure

0:30:48.450,0:30:53.880
almost you know maybe it's me but it's

0:30:51.540,0:30:58.110
me when I'm 12

0:30:53.880,0:31:01.770
it's me with big red hair it's another

0:30:58.110,0:31:02.460
so I'm asking who is this person where

0:31:01.770,0:31:08.640
is she

0:31:02.460,0:31:12.960
are he sometimes I think I'm in a kind

0:31:08.640,0:31:15.270
of gender shift I like that because I

0:31:12.960,0:31:17.400
was a real tomboy as a little kid and I

0:31:15.270,0:31:19.800
think I kind of squashed that little

0:31:17.400,0:31:21.330
tomboy down and he likes to come back

0:31:19.800,0:31:24.120
and say things once in a while and he's

0:31:21.330,0:31:32.280
a little bit of a sassy smadi kid and I

0:31:24.120,0:31:36.360
like him so who is she where are we in

0:31:32.280,0:31:38.300
the poem I need to get located in

0:31:36.360,0:31:43.940
time-space

0:31:38.300,0:31:47.430
and what the heck is going on like what

0:31:43.940,0:31:50.250
dramatically is happening in the poem

0:31:47.430,0:31:52.560
and a lot of times I'm you know I'll

0:31:50.250,0:31:57.930
have a fix on one or the other of these

0:31:52.560,0:31:59.760
questions but I'm really feeling unclear

0:31:57.930,0:32:02.790
about the other so I kind of know

0:31:59.760,0:32:05.240
questions to ask myself and that's what

0:32:02.790,0:32:07.680
I do in there really early stages of

0:32:05.240,0:32:10.770
drafting the poem and trying to figure

0:32:07.680,0:32:12.510
out the answers to some of those and how

0:32:10.770,0:32:14.210
do these questions then translate into

0:32:12.510,0:32:15.900
like into the basic physical

0:32:14.210,0:32:17.550
manifestation of your writing are you

0:32:15.900,0:32:20.550
are you still in your notebooks working

0:32:17.550,0:32:23.010
yeah okay yeah fill in notebooks and are

0:32:20.550,0:32:25.410
you writing these questions in no now

0:32:23.010,0:32:29.370
I'm just what I'm doing is I'm just

0:32:25.410,0:32:32.460
getting my imagination a chore a task

0:32:29.370,0:32:34.680
instead I'm staring into space and

0:32:32.460,0:32:38.660
trying to see like where's the set where

0:32:34.680,0:32:40.650
is this unfolding trying to give myself

0:32:38.660,0:32:42.330
I'm so I'm interested in all this

0:32:40.650,0:32:44.640
material and I remember let's say you're

0:32:42.330,0:32:46.680
a poet but I mean it's also like you

0:32:44.640,0:32:48.720
knows it so you haven't so much up here

0:32:46.680,0:32:49.049
just that it doesn't happen on on the

0:32:48.720,0:32:50.639
page

0:32:49.049,0:32:52.889
doesn't happen it happens a lot yeah

0:32:50.639,0:32:54.450
going to the store and thinking about

0:32:52.889,0:32:57.980
for listening to me of your own sound

0:32:54.450,0:33:02.429
this is another hard things dr. Porter

0:32:57.980,0:33:04.320
yeah and see none of this takes place

0:33:02.429,0:33:07.049
with fictional fiction you're sort of

0:33:04.320,0:33:10.470
that you've got all that as you walk

0:33:07.049,0:33:12.179
into the first thing great great well

0:33:10.470,0:33:14.460
then so so what is your mode when you're

0:33:12.179,0:33:16.759
advising a story like how do you how do

0:33:14.460,0:33:21.239
you work through the drafts of the story

0:33:16.759,0:33:24.899
well with a story I'm really thinking a

0:33:21.239,0:33:28.879
lot more about why does this happen or

0:33:24.899,0:33:30.989
why did this happen in the past tense

0:33:28.879,0:33:31.350
actually have a lot of questions

0:33:30.989,0:33:35.369
thoughts

0:33:31.350,0:33:37.379
motivations of the characters or what

0:33:35.369,0:33:40.320
their relationships are like how did

0:33:37.379,0:33:42.450
they get to this I'm often trying to

0:33:40.320,0:33:46.259
think about a little some details of

0:33:42.450,0:33:50.090
backstory you know again you know all

0:33:46.259,0:33:52.830
these things it's really helped to have

0:33:50.090,0:33:55.549
heard myself ask my students these

0:33:52.830,0:33:59.279
questions for the last 30 years yeah

0:33:55.549,0:34:03.330
they're kind of in there this is yeah

0:33:59.279,0:34:07.590
the questions to ask yourself and but I

0:34:03.330,0:34:10.649
think what I'm mainly doing once I have

0:34:07.590,0:34:13.700
addressed some of these questions I mean

0:34:10.649,0:34:17.879
we have to do with inferiority and

0:34:13.700,0:34:21.000
psychology of people is in revision I'm

0:34:17.879,0:34:23.909
just trying to get the story to move

0:34:21.000,0:34:28.139
along I'm really paying most attention

0:34:23.909,0:34:31.049
to the pace and I think in that regard

0:34:28.139,0:34:34.980
now poetry and fiction maybe have a

0:34:31.049,0:34:37.889
little more similarities when you get to

0:34:34.980,0:34:40.290
that stage of revision where you're

0:34:37.889,0:34:42.299
starting to really start to tighten yeah

0:34:40.290,0:34:46.669
are we there now what that was talking

0:34:42.299,0:34:53.250
about no yes okay your bands so then

0:34:46.669,0:34:57.960
with the poem I flash mercilessly I'm a

0:34:53.250,0:34:59.819
slasher yes and I move things around but

0:34:57.960,0:35:02.970
often when I'm moving around is you know

0:34:59.819,0:35:06.340
I've got too many lines on

0:35:02.970,0:35:09.010
the landscape all in a row here I've got

0:35:06.340,0:35:11.710
ten lines about a freaking place where

0:35:09.010,0:35:13.930
we are the best boring but I sometimes I

0:35:11.710,0:35:16.420
won't cut them I'll just take four of

0:35:13.930,0:35:18.870
them and put them in a different place

0:35:16.420,0:35:22.210
and I don't worry too much about like

0:35:18.870,0:35:25.600
how to get back there because that's

0:35:22.210,0:35:27.460
easy to do later and same in fiction

0:35:25.600,0:35:30.900
what I'm really thinking about pacing

0:35:27.460,0:35:34.440
I'm thinking about you know like the

0:35:30.900,0:35:38.050
opening of the story I'll just start

0:35:34.440,0:35:40.600
with the scene that we're going to catch

0:35:38.050,0:35:41.980
back up to in the middle but because

0:35:40.600,0:35:43.450
it's got some interest I think

0:35:41.980,0:35:44.800
interesting dialogue or something

0:35:43.450,0:35:47.020
interesting is going on with the

0:35:44.800,0:35:50.080
characters I'm going to start there and

0:35:47.020,0:35:52.630
then circle back and then catch back up

0:35:50.080,0:35:54.280
to it midway through the story oh and

0:35:52.630,0:35:57.730
you're for that same cut that's typical

0:35:54.280,0:35:59.230
for me to UM move around like that so

0:35:57.730,0:36:01.750
I'm just going okay we've got a scene a

0:35:59.230,0:36:03.610
dialogue now we're going to have you

0:36:01.750,0:36:06.280
know how to dissolve start now we're

0:36:03.610,0:36:08.440
going to have scene where we've got some

0:36:06.280,0:36:10.830
dream or some thinking that we're going

0:36:08.440,0:36:17.410
to go back to dialog so I'm just kind of

0:36:10.830,0:36:19.030
having some syncopation of pacing things

0:36:17.410,0:36:20.530
and that kind of happens throughout your

0:36:19.030,0:36:22.030
books to write not if not only within

0:36:20.530,0:36:25.380
the story hood within a collection of

0:36:22.030,0:36:25.380
stories there's sort of that same

0:36:25.980,0:36:30.520
disadvantages of such as it seems or not

0:36:29.020,0:36:33.190
not repetition but like a kind of

0:36:30.520,0:36:34.750
allusion to the same places and time and

0:36:33.190,0:36:37.030
space

0:36:34.750,0:36:38.590
so I guess is that when you are when

0:36:37.030,0:36:40.300
you're revising the entire book is that

0:36:38.590,0:36:42.850
when you're putting together the book

0:36:40.300,0:36:47.530
itself is that also happening yeah okay

0:36:42.850,0:36:53.860
okay so have these two modes of revision

0:36:47.530,0:36:55.840
that sort of focus on pacing and moving

0:36:53.860,0:36:57.760
around any changes how they changed over

0:36:55.840,0:36:58.960
the course of your career I mean did you

0:36:57.760,0:37:00.910
like when you were first starting out

0:36:58.960,0:37:03.760
writing did you have to come to this

0:37:00.910,0:37:07.240
kind of way of revising or it did just

0:37:03.760,0:37:12.010
what was it there from the beginning no

0:37:07.240,0:37:13.840
it's been a slow gradual process in the

0:37:12.010,0:37:14.180
beginning was was there a different kind

0:37:13.840,0:37:16.550
of way

0:37:14.180,0:37:19.700
more you know we're doing it more

0:37:16.550,0:37:23.480
by-the-book kind of speaker was it oh

0:37:19.700,0:37:25.400
gosh I don't I don't know how I was

0:37:23.480,0:37:27.860
doing anything at the beginning I know

0:37:25.400,0:37:28.850
you know what my first book of poems I

0:37:27.860,0:37:33.110
had help

0:37:28.850,0:37:35.150
I've never had an editor again yeah like

0:37:33.110,0:37:36.890
I had with that very first book Larry

0:37:35.150,0:37:38.390
Lieberman at University of Illinois

0:37:36.890,0:37:41.450
press

0:37:38.390,0:37:44.930
he weeded out some of the weaker poems

0:37:41.450,0:37:47.830
but also helped me to shape up some new

0:37:44.930,0:37:50.750
things I was working on and put them in

0:37:47.830,0:37:52.520
help me with the arrangement and you

0:37:50.750,0:37:55.100
know I've never had help like that again

0:37:52.520,0:37:58.340
but that was very instructive yeah Kimmy

0:37:55.100,0:38:00.830
yeah he would write me these interesting

0:37:58.340,0:38:02.690
little letters were you explained you

0:38:00.830,0:38:05.300
know why he thought this article here

0:38:02.690,0:38:09.380
and this go there and this stanza needed

0:38:05.300,0:38:11.510
to be gone this was stupid it was just

0:38:09.380,0:38:13.640
so helpful to have somebody be such a

0:38:11.510,0:38:16.370
close reader with the scene I said if

0:38:13.640,0:38:18.410
you ever had them again ever so so do

0:38:16.370,0:38:19.790
people play a role in your revision

0:38:18.410,0:38:22.970
process now or is it pretty much just

0:38:19.790,0:38:25.190
you um well my husband reads everything

0:38:22.970,0:38:29.270
and he's really really tough critic

0:38:25.190,0:38:35.090
really really tough it's very good but

0:38:29.270,0:38:39.230
he I think he's smart reader and he also

0:38:35.090,0:38:42.770
kind of knows what I'm capable of and if

0:38:39.230,0:38:46.520
I don't measure up he'll tell me yes

0:38:42.770,0:38:50.590
yeah so you don't all right you're not

0:38:46.520,0:38:54.590
corresponding with other writers I have

0:38:50.590,0:38:59.680
I have a couple of good fiction writer

0:38:54.590,0:39:03.760
friends that I have shared work with and

0:38:59.680,0:39:07.340
another a novel I had a two book

0:39:03.760,0:39:09.740
contract this is the book of stories

0:39:07.340,0:39:12.380
before this one and they wanted the

0:39:09.740,0:39:13.610
second thing to be a novel the publisher

0:39:12.380,0:39:16.670
I told you who decided they were going

0:39:13.610,0:39:19.070
to quit this is fiction and they wanted

0:39:16.670,0:39:22.390
the second book to be a novel so I I

0:39:19.070,0:39:26.690
tried three times to write a novel and I

0:39:22.390,0:39:29.450
got two hundred pages in three times

0:39:26.690,0:39:32.240
yeah and I showed a couple of those

0:39:29.450,0:39:37.460
books to friends who are fiction writers

0:39:32.240,0:39:39.140
and they they confirmed for me that what

0:39:37.460,0:39:42.140
I thought was true the way I could

0:39:39.140,0:39:47.540
phrase it to myself is they didn't have

0:39:42.140,0:39:52.850
a big enough engine I like a short story

0:39:47.540,0:39:56.080
I'm I like to go cut I like short

0:39:52.850,0:39:58.820
stories - I was struck though in quake

0:39:56.080,0:40:00.050
right but like I was I was reading that

0:39:58.820,0:40:02.570
and I thought it was I mean it read to

0:40:00.050,0:40:05.000
me and helps me a lot like the way that

0:40:02.570,0:40:06.770
Jennifer Egan is explaining we do love

0:40:05.000,0:40:09.080
working out in like separate stories but

0:40:06.770,0:40:12.200
all kind of like it's an investigating

0:40:09.080,0:40:13.700
certain kind of dilemmas and an

0:40:12.200,0:40:17.450
interesting kind of metaphorical

0:40:13.700,0:40:19.700
noticeable is well thank you I was that

0:40:17.450,0:40:21.020
good positive yes yeah with that but I

0:40:19.700,0:40:22.310
was like I mean like what did she call

0:40:21.020,0:40:24.740
this or not I mean I just was wondering

0:40:22.310,0:40:26.600
you know it's not anyway it's just such

0:40:24.740,0:40:29.420
a there's very arbitrary but I think I

0:40:26.600,0:40:31.070
can compose them very much separately

0:40:29.420,0:40:33.350
I mean that they are related right and

0:40:31.070,0:40:35.840
amazing yeah they're weak stories yeah

0:40:33.350,0:40:38.150
they've all been linked yes I really I

0:40:35.840,0:40:42.350
love all the different possibilities of

0:40:38.150,0:40:46.010
ways to link stories but in terms of the

0:40:42.350,0:40:49.280
engine yeah I like a little small engine

0:40:46.010,0:40:53.600
that I feel like I can I can fix what's

0:40:49.280,0:40:56.570
wrong with a little small engine and I

0:40:53.600,0:40:59.150
don't know if I could the novel thing

0:40:56.570,0:41:02.870
it's kind of overwhelming for me to

0:40:59.150,0:41:05.420
think about yeah how much you have to

0:41:02.870,0:41:09.290
sustain how much should have how much

0:41:05.420,0:41:11.990
needs to drive a big novel and I love

0:41:09.290,0:41:17.180
novels I was really none but I'm

0:41:11.990,0:41:19.550
intimidated by the arc how huge it needs

0:41:17.180,0:41:25.360
to be and how much maybe you need to

0:41:19.550,0:41:28.220
know before you sit down right there

0:41:25.360,0:41:29.600
writing a tale any sort of research or

0:41:28.220,0:41:32.270
circle or otherwise

0:41:29.600,0:41:34.370
yeah like quake was a good example I

0:41:32.270,0:41:36.410
love doing all that research on the

0:41:34.370,0:41:38.339
gypsy culture in the country I just

0:41:36.410,0:41:40.739
loved it oh yeah

0:41:38.339,0:41:42.539
and that just really fed my story so I

0:41:40.739,0:41:45.599
was looking on it and there's new books

0:41:42.539,0:41:48.569
that has a dinosaur dig in it that was

0:41:45.599,0:41:52.229
really fun meet my husband I went on the

0:41:48.569,0:41:54.390
dig in Montana as part of the research

0:41:52.229,0:41:57.269
for that fun made especially they just

0:41:54.390,0:41:58.859
have that like dinosaur versus dinosaur

0:41:57.269,0:42:00.660
discovery or something this summer could

0:41:58.859,0:42:02.789
you see this formed with like some

0:42:00.660,0:42:07.319
private invest in private digger found

0:42:02.789,0:42:09.269
these like perfectly preserved fossils

0:42:07.319,0:42:11.039
of like a Tyrannosaurus Rex worth like a

0:42:09.269,0:42:12.509
Stegosaurus like right next to

0:42:11.039,0:42:14.819
tremendous oh that that you made fight

0:42:12.509,0:42:16.589
and so they stole it and like I said wow

0:42:14.819,0:42:18.689
there's only big folded adoption for

0:42:16.589,0:42:20.819
some ridiculous price really sort of the

0:42:18.689,0:42:22.829
debate about this just like a couple of

0:42:20.819,0:42:26.099
Famers or something a couple of like

0:42:22.829,0:42:29.099
hold the whole week creatures Wow didn't

0:42:26.099,0:42:32.339
sleep and insane fine in Montana you

0:42:29.099,0:42:34.410
know and that's right well what I

0:42:32.339,0:42:37.380
understood was that on this is

0:42:34.410,0:42:42.269
interesting but what I heard was um

0:42:37.380,0:42:45.289
all those glacial floods what happened

0:42:42.269,0:42:48.329
and they basically wash all these bones

0:42:45.289,0:42:50.789
over and fall there be like this giant

0:42:48.329,0:42:53.039
phone bed of you know 20 different

0:42:50.789,0:42:55.499
species but just because they've been

0:42:53.039,0:43:03.469
washed by the floods like that yeah up

0:42:55.499,0:43:06.839
the same place I just read those words I

0:43:03.469,0:43:09.359
guess then what a couple more questions

0:43:06.839,0:43:11.039
what revision but some and then so I

0:43:09.359,0:43:12.539
guess one of the like I've been reading

0:43:11.039,0:43:14.009
this book called the work of revision

0:43:12.539,0:43:15.390
which is a really interesting book kind

0:43:14.009,0:43:16.949
of tracing the history of revision so

0:43:15.390,0:43:19.439
much romantics up through the modernist

0:43:16.949,0:43:23.369
period and then kind of how textual

0:43:19.439,0:43:24.689
critisism works with it but and she was

0:43:23.369,0:43:26.369
sort of earnings Hannah Sullivan wrote

0:43:24.689,0:43:29.459
and she was sort of delineating kind of

0:43:26.369,0:43:30.719
three modes of vision one being a

0:43:29.459,0:43:32.369
creative like

0:43:30.719,0:43:34.140
joyce adding all the stuff Pacifica and

0:43:32.369,0:43:38.189
the other parts of the other season it's

0:43:34.140,0:43:39.509
the sort of excitable subtractive way

0:43:38.189,0:43:41.579
that you seem to do and then there's

0:43:39.509,0:43:43.289
that sort of substitution and I'm

0:43:41.579,0:43:45.239
wondering if their primary mode between

0:43:43.289,0:43:46.770
those three that you use for your

0:43:45.239,0:43:52.960
revision or is

0:43:46.770,0:43:57.940
combination hmm I would say I I really

0:43:52.960,0:44:01.690
kind of start with the excretion first

0:43:57.940,0:44:05.200
yeah and then go into the subtraction

0:44:01.690,0:44:07.119
and then probably this substitution it's

0:44:05.200,0:44:10.450
like the pink ring I do at the very end

0:44:07.119,0:44:12.460
okay and physically where where do these

0:44:10.450,0:44:14.290
processes happen I mean like you're

0:44:12.460,0:44:16.840
taking this way by having in the

0:44:14.290,0:44:19.500
notebook what does that happen on the

0:44:16.840,0:44:25.270
computer or that happen in those spaces

0:44:19.500,0:44:28.869
usually I've excised much of what I was

0:44:25.270,0:44:30.700
going to take out before I type it up so

0:44:28.869,0:44:34.240
I probably as I said I'll probably do

0:44:30.700,0:44:37.210
two or three handwritten drafts and I'll

0:44:34.240,0:44:40.360
rip actually rip the notebook page out

0:44:37.210,0:44:42.400
or and I have snow books and notebooks

0:44:40.360,0:44:45.700
where I I have a big X through the page

0:44:42.400,0:44:47.680
to so that I do not get confused that

0:44:45.700,0:44:50.200
I'm actually done with this version now

0:44:47.680,0:44:52.030
there's a if I look hard enough in the

0:44:50.200,0:44:55.060
notebook there is a later version of the

0:44:52.030,0:44:56.650
pause but I so I throw the old ripped

0:44:55.060,0:45:00.460
out pages in the back of the notebook

0:44:56.650,0:45:04.650
and there's a newer version somewhere in

0:45:00.460,0:45:07.660
there but the older ones are fatter and

0:45:04.650,0:45:10.990
often I'm awful you know experimenting

0:45:07.660,0:45:16.990
with line breaks than to you know what's

0:45:10.990,0:45:18.880
the shape shaping issues and and so just

0:45:16.990,0:45:21.430
to confirm that you're doing that in the

0:45:18.880,0:45:23.950
notebook and then I'll book still so and

0:45:21.430,0:45:26.800
then I feel like when I move it to the

0:45:23.950,0:45:29.200
computer I'm sort of getting to a place

0:45:26.800,0:45:30.609
where I want to look at it there's

0:45:29.200,0:45:32.700
something I'm sure you're going to hear

0:45:30.609,0:45:35.740
this with lots of writers my age that

0:45:32.700,0:45:39.990
there's something about when you type it

0:45:35.740,0:45:44.109
up that starts to make it look and

0:45:39.990,0:45:49.480
permanent especially for me in terms of

0:45:44.109,0:45:55.270
the shape of the poem the the line

0:45:49.480,0:45:57.430
length especially in a poem I am less

0:45:55.270,0:46:00.040
inclined to fiddle with line lengths

0:45:57.430,0:46:03.520
once I've got it on the

0:46:00.040,0:46:05.410
on the computer I do that is but for

0:46:03.520,0:46:07.570
some reason it still feels easier for me

0:46:05.410,0:46:11.920
to do it on the page could like to stick

0:46:07.570,0:46:13.990
my slashes in there okay and so once

0:46:11.920,0:46:17.109
they're actually broken into lines on

0:46:13.990,0:46:18.460
the computer yeah you don't have you

0:46:17.109,0:46:22.720
don't feel like you still have that

0:46:18.460,0:46:25.060
freedom - well I do I do I do experiment

0:46:22.720,0:46:28.750
or you know something I'll go oh this is

0:46:25.060,0:46:34.500
15 lines it's so close to us on it I

0:46:28.750,0:46:37.450
don't I help it along you know so then

0:46:34.500,0:46:44.680
there should be like another times or 15

0:46:37.450,0:46:47.440
money yeah okay so and then at that

0:46:44.680,0:46:49.510
point are the ponies ordered into the

0:46:47.440,0:46:52.000
way you would like them in the hotel not

0:46:49.510,0:46:52.930
never so how does that with that

0:46:52.000,0:46:57.180
processor

0:46:52.930,0:47:00.820
oh that's just another process of just

0:46:57.180,0:47:06.040
printing out all the poems and then just

0:47:00.820,0:47:10.510
living with them and that takes I know

0:47:06.040,0:47:16.740
maybe a year to maybe even longer

0:47:10.510,0:47:19.180
sometimes of experimenting with sections

0:47:16.740,0:47:21.690
you know the arrangement I'm working

0:47:19.180,0:47:27.359
right now in a book of prose poems and

0:47:21.690,0:47:33.030
I'm just really struggling with what's

0:47:27.359,0:47:35.380
what's even going to be in this book 14

0:47:33.030,0:47:38.050
so there's there's a number so once you

0:47:35.380,0:47:39.790
get as a computer are you putting like

0:47:38.050,0:47:42.160
all the poems from windows look in one

0:47:39.790,0:47:46.600
word file say or are you putting them

0:47:42.160,0:47:50.830
individually um no I don't put I each

0:47:46.600,0:47:54.070
poem is its own file until I really

0:47:50.830,0:47:56.710
start to make the book as a book okay

0:47:54.070,0:47:58.600
until you're like so it's just

0:47:56.710,0:48:00.550
technically then you play call that file

0:47:58.600,0:48:03.010
whatever the title of the poem is yeah

0:48:00.550,0:48:10.000
and then save it saved in a folder with

0:48:03.010,0:48:12.369
my folder is called home al and there

0:48:10.000,0:48:13.300
are some subfolders in their labors

0:48:12.369,0:48:15.160
um

0:48:13.300,0:48:17.710
for a book would you make us a folder

0:48:15.160,0:48:20.980
then or well then each book gets its own

0:48:17.710,0:48:22.780
file then okay yeah okay but it's so the

0:48:20.980,0:48:24.880
poems are kind of in one day folder and

0:48:22.780,0:48:27.130
then as they calculate into a book that

0:48:24.880,0:48:29.530
will be 1/5 exactly and if it when they

0:48:27.130,0:48:32.260
get published and I put them in another

0:48:29.530,0:48:34.690
file called published poems okay so I

0:48:32.260,0:48:38.380
don't get don't get confused and not

0:48:34.690,0:48:40.360
spending yeah so yeah and then there's

0:48:38.380,0:48:47.050
some old you know I have filed called

0:48:40.360,0:48:50.350
files called pawns Oh ate better just

0:48:47.050,0:48:52.630
like I'm never going to probably do

0:48:50.350,0:48:58.180
anything with them now but they're still

0:48:52.630,0:48:59.530
sitting there and is that the same that

0:48:58.180,0:49:07.660
same sort of transfer happened with

0:48:59.530,0:49:12.690
fiction - um yeah I mean I've got a file

0:49:07.660,0:49:16.360
in there just called stories in process

0:49:12.690,0:49:23.770
and I don't know if they're going to be

0:49:16.360,0:49:25.510
a book yeah and so we'll get back to

0:49:23.770,0:49:27.730
computer stuff a little bit more let me

0:49:25.510,0:49:28.870
just sort of talk a little bit move from

0:49:27.730,0:49:31.540
revision and talk a little bit more

0:49:28.870,0:49:32.890
about kind of organizational and if

0:49:31.540,0:49:40.660
we're already kind of talking about it

0:49:32.890,0:49:44.140
these things also mention any but so I

0:49:40.660,0:49:45.880
mean well okay but with the computer

0:49:44.140,0:49:47.620
then you know you move from your

0:49:45.880,0:49:49.060
notebook and then you type it up and is

0:49:47.620,0:49:51.910
that that sort of a moment of revision

0:49:49.060,0:49:53.560
for you - and then you have several

0:49:51.910,0:49:55.750
other different moments of revision when

0:49:53.560,0:49:57.190
it's on the computer but some of those

0:49:55.750,0:50:00.010
happen in paper because you print them

0:49:57.190,0:50:02.290
out right and then that's that

0:50:00.010,0:50:07.210
arrangement happens physically usually

0:50:02.290,0:50:10.480
first and oh look I will look at it I'll

0:50:07.210,0:50:12.100
come back to it over a period of a I

0:50:10.480,0:50:13.920
don't know a couple of weeks on the

0:50:12.100,0:50:17.410
computer then once it's in a computer

0:50:13.920,0:50:19.210
file and look at it probably tinker with

0:50:17.410,0:50:20.650
it a little bit more before and then

0:50:19.210,0:50:23.680
I'll start sending it out probably

0:50:20.650,0:50:26.260
scooter so fairly soon after I type it

0:50:23.680,0:50:30.490
up maybe a month too

0:50:26.260,0:50:33.550
yeah I there comes a point where I feel

0:50:30.490,0:50:34.780
like I'm making it worse yeah yeah my

0:50:33.550,0:50:37.150
tinkering is starting to make it worse

0:50:34.780,0:50:45.550
that's the only thing that stops me and

0:50:37.150,0:50:48.300
then I start sending it out and it's our

0:50:45.550,0:50:51.730
book right now no just individual poems

0:50:48.300,0:50:53.290
and then if it comes back rejected often

0:50:51.730,0:50:57.570
I'll tinker a little bit more and send

0:50:53.290,0:50:59.710
it back out again so you use the sort of

0:50:57.570,0:51:05.610
publication and submission process as a

0:50:59.710,0:51:05.610
sort of revision proper I do okay hmm

0:51:06.150,0:51:11.740
and then so okay then they come together

0:51:09.070,0:51:13.390
in one file as your focal saying in

0:51:11.740,0:51:15.370
between and that out and then the

0:51:13.390,0:51:17.440
publishers and it's a similar sort of

0:51:15.370,0:51:19.870
thing accusative subjective you can

0:51:17.440,0:51:21.250
revise again or that sort of once it's

0:51:19.870,0:51:22.960
in that file once you've got it there

0:51:21.250,0:51:29.590
you just sort of want to get to give it

0:51:22.960,0:51:31.540
a see um I hope probably revise it a

0:51:29.590,0:51:36.280
little bit more if it comes back

0:51:31.540,0:51:37.210
rejected but usually once it skips in

0:51:36.280,0:51:41.470
book form

0:51:37.210,0:51:44.530
um yeah it seems sort of settled to me

0:51:41.470,0:51:47.740
and often that this may be a awful the

0:51:44.530,0:51:49.810
case um the reason for that being that

0:51:47.740,0:51:53.050
I've probably moved on to another book

0:51:49.810,0:51:57.010
about it and that's another don't work

0:51:53.050,0:51:59.530
yeah yeah no an actual and I'm actually

0:51:57.010,0:52:04.420
compiling another book at that point

0:51:59.530,0:52:07.090
when I start to me one out and how many

0:52:04.420,0:52:09.340
books do you usually have going how many

0:52:07.090,0:52:11.800
projects at one time you usually have

0:52:09.340,0:52:15.070
two well I almost always have a book of

0:52:11.800,0:52:17.410
poems yes in process that I'm working on

0:52:15.070,0:52:20.880
like I said right now we'll keep trying

0:52:17.410,0:52:23.200
to shape up this book of prose poems and

0:52:20.880,0:52:26.460
then I almost always have a book of

0:52:23.200,0:52:30.670
fiction that's in process right now I'm

0:52:26.460,0:52:35.140
working on a ebooks novel novella thing

0:52:30.670,0:52:37.720
and and then you know I'm doing the

0:52:35.140,0:52:40.030
photos and also in terms of like

0:52:37.720,0:52:44.620
publishing individual pieces

0:52:40.030,0:52:47.680
I'm really doing those a lot okay

0:52:44.620,0:52:49.480
and then so in terms of just sort of

0:52:47.680,0:52:51.580
saving and archiving in your work

0:52:49.480,0:52:53.440
you think we talked a little bit about

0:52:51.580,0:52:57.100
this to keep your notebooks basically in

0:52:53.440,0:52:59.290
boxes on the shelf and then your files

0:52:57.100,0:53:00.850
are in a folder and they just stay in

0:52:59.290,0:53:04.390
the same folder and you put them to an

0:53:00.850,0:53:07.270
external drive yep importantly is there

0:53:04.390,0:53:08.800
any other kind of archival or backup

0:53:07.270,0:53:16.780
procedures that you go through for your

0:53:08.800,0:53:19.450
work or is that pretty much yes I guess

0:53:16.780,0:53:25.690
that's pretty much it I mean my

0:53:19.450,0:53:28.870
publishers I think have copies you know

0:53:25.690,0:53:34.540
they have PDF yeah of everything right

0:53:28.870,0:53:44.740
so I rely on them but those are not

0:53:34.540,0:53:48.160
going to go away I don't they send me to

0:53:44.740,0:53:50.980
prove now yes yeah okay and they used to

0:53:48.160,0:53:53.160
send you galleys or or pretty though

0:53:50.980,0:53:55.960
yeah huh

0:53:53.160,0:53:57.670
and where do you do much revision in the

0:53:55.960,0:54:02.670
best days not that one they don't like

0:53:57.670,0:54:04.990
it okay yeah yeah okay so then I guess

0:54:02.670,0:54:06.250
one question more and then I want to

0:54:04.990,0:54:09.400
talk kind of about computers

0:54:06.250,0:54:11.740
specifically but do you see kind of a

0:54:09.400,0:54:12.910
Miss talking listed is there was there

0:54:11.740,0:54:14.560
sort of thing you kind of delineate

0:54:12.910,0:54:16.600
stages in your own writing over the

0:54:14.560,0:54:18.690
course of your you know your stupid

0:54:16.600,0:54:20.800
writing so professionally do you see

0:54:18.690,0:54:27.280
distinct stages or do you think it's

0:54:20.800,0:54:29.610
just been kind of gradual you mean

0:54:27.280,0:54:31.870
that's where things have just changed

0:54:29.610,0:54:33.280
dramatically or like you know they could

0:54:31.870,0:54:34.930
have changed over like a couple of years

0:54:33.280,0:54:36.100
but I mean I could you can't would you

0:54:34.930,0:54:38.200
say there are stages or would you just

0:54:36.100,0:54:39.640
see it kind of and if there were

0:54:38.200,0:54:41.380
anything that kind of prompted some

0:54:39.640,0:54:42.640
changes well for those I guess it's

0:54:41.380,0:54:46.940
where I'm kind of filling

0:54:42.640,0:54:51.770
well I think it's mostly been gradual

0:54:46.940,0:54:55.580
that I've I've grown more comfortable

0:54:51.770,0:54:59.000
doing some revision work on the computer

0:54:55.580,0:55:01.220
and especially with the fiction and

0:54:59.000,0:55:07.490
maybe because fiction is still feels

0:55:01.220,0:55:11.109
like a newer form to me one shift that

0:55:07.490,0:55:15.230
has felt a little bit more dramatic with

0:55:11.109,0:55:18.940
composing is that I have found myself

0:55:15.230,0:55:24.080
and I'm working on short stories

0:55:18.940,0:55:26.540
actually doing some new composing work

0:55:24.080,0:55:31.010
right here while I'm sitting there like

0:55:26.540,0:55:35.690
out I'll be working on a story you know

0:55:31.010,0:55:39.859
thinking I'm typing in from my notebook

0:55:35.690,0:55:43.130
and actually I remember working on this

0:55:39.859,0:55:45.619
one story and I had written them

0:55:43.130,0:55:49.430
something a note to myself in my

0:55:45.619,0:55:52.339
notebook that said flush out her dream

0:55:49.430,0:55:54.320
right here and I had forgotten to do

0:55:52.339,0:55:59.180
that so I remember sitting here doing it

0:55:54.320,0:56:02.780
while I was typing in the story on this

0:55:59.180,0:56:04.450
into my word file and I thought when I

0:56:02.780,0:56:08.480
wrote was okay

0:56:04.450,0:56:11.510
and it sort of freed me up then to do

0:56:08.480,0:56:15.410
that more frequently to let myself do

0:56:11.510,0:56:17.420
some of the initial composing although I

0:56:15.410,0:56:20.150
still kind of like have a little cue

0:56:17.420,0:56:21.770
that what it's going to be you know like

0:56:20.150,0:56:25.130
there's a little hole that I forgot to

0:56:21.770,0:56:29.300
do or and I have a note to myself in the

0:56:25.130,0:56:31.910
notebook okay so do that I guess how

0:56:29.300,0:56:34.670
does was the difference in feel between

0:56:31.910,0:56:36.680
I guess Barry doesn't care does writing

0:56:34.670,0:56:40.450
with two-handed writing versus one yeah

0:56:36.680,0:56:43.730
what one of the things that I like about

0:56:40.450,0:56:49.250
doing it on the computer is I can close

0:56:43.730,0:56:52.430
my eyes which isn't really odd but I

0:56:49.250,0:56:53.540
like it and so it seems to lend itself

0:56:52.430,0:56:58.070
to

0:56:53.540,0:57:00.760
whoo somewheres not to dialogues or

0:56:58.070,0:57:04.280
actions but to real kind of interior

0:57:00.760,0:57:06.860
moments where I'm in a character's mind

0:57:04.280,0:57:08.990
and I want to replicate our thinking

0:57:06.860,0:57:10.580
process like I said what's the first

0:57:08.990,0:57:13.670
time I ever tried it was where I kind of

0:57:10.580,0:57:16.400
tried to render a dream but the

0:57:13.670,0:57:18.500
character had had so I close my eyes you

0:57:16.400,0:57:21.530
know he's Corsican type of rifle right

0:57:18.500,0:57:26.020
but I can't write with my icicle okay

0:57:21.530,0:57:26.020
you really invertible yeah yeah yeah

0:57:28.840,0:57:36.110
okay so in terms of computers generally

0:57:32.840,0:57:39.830
when did you when did they enter into

0:57:36.110,0:57:41.540
your writing process well when I I

0:57:39.830,0:57:42.920
remember when I moved to Lake Forest

0:57:41.540,0:57:44.210
College I knew were going to ask me this

0:57:42.920,0:57:47.840
I was trying to think about this the

0:57:44.210,0:57:52.820
other day and we got these when I wish I

0:57:47.840,0:57:56.000
could k-pro favorite okay have you heard

0:57:52.820,0:58:01.340
of those no oh my god they were these

0:57:56.000,0:58:08.990
huge grey boxes and they were given to

0:58:01.340,0:58:12.560
us this must have been 1980 right around

0:58:08.990,0:58:14.840
there 1980 at Lake Forest College all

0:58:12.560,0:58:17.690
the faculty got these k-pro computer

0:58:14.840,0:58:22.880
things and really all they did was word

0:58:17.690,0:58:24.920
processing so but I liked him I remember

0:58:22.880,0:58:28.070
a lot of the faculty were complaining

0:58:24.920,0:58:30.050
but I believe you know because I was

0:58:28.070,0:58:33.770
moving from I like a Selectric

0:58:30.050,0:58:36.170
typewriter something and this machine

0:58:33.770,0:58:39.800
was so much easier to do corrections and

0:58:36.170,0:58:41.600
everything yeah and so I took to the

0:58:39.800,0:58:44.870
computer right away I really liked it

0:58:41.600,0:58:47.690
you making me yeah okay that's very

0:58:44.870,0:58:48.980
really well I can't remember the exact

0:58:47.690,0:58:51.950
here somewhere I mean you started

0:58:48.980,0:58:53.780
teaching in Lake Forest in 79 so it was

0:58:51.950,0:58:55.910
right around there when we first moved

0:58:53.780,0:58:58.580
there yeah and that's all they did they

0:58:55.910,0:59:01.720
didn't do there was no internet or right

0:58:58.580,0:59:05.020
yeah we were just just WordPerfect yeah

0:59:01.720,0:59:05.020
did this

0:59:05.590,0:59:10.210
well the advent of this computer and

0:59:08.080,0:59:11.980
then maybe like the kind of more

0:59:10.210,0:59:13.960
prevalence of computers kind of change

0:59:11.980,0:59:19.390
your writing practices pretty

0:59:13.960,0:59:23.220
drastically eventually or well and the

0:59:19.390,0:59:27.340
you know the academic world I don't know

0:59:23.220,0:59:30.820
if I hadn't been in the Academy if I

0:59:27.340,0:59:33.850
would be have the same relationship with

0:59:30.820,0:59:36.370
technology as I do because everywhere I

0:59:33.850,0:59:39.090
went to teach I was presented with a new

0:59:36.370,0:59:44.310
computer when I walked in the door and

0:59:39.090,0:59:50.050
and it's nice and because you know Apple

0:59:44.310,0:59:52.510
made its money by habituation habitual I

0:59:50.050,0:59:55.360
seen people with Lauren trying to say no

0:59:52.510,0:59:57.880
to their to their technology yes that's

0:59:55.360,1:00:00.310
how they became so great you know you

0:59:57.880,1:00:02.350
know get all these freshmen hooked on

1:00:00.310,1:00:04.690
apples when they're in college because

1:00:02.350,1:00:06.250
they're in the labs and then the next

1:00:04.690,1:00:10.630
thing you know you've got generations

1:00:06.250,1:00:13.570
out there and so anyway I am the total

1:00:10.630,1:00:17.020
Mac person I love them I think they seem

1:00:13.570,1:00:19.810
really intuitive to me to use them but

1:00:17.020,1:00:24.040
and but I've grown up with them great I

1:00:19.810,1:00:25.660
mean so and then I guess what about the

1:00:24.040,1:00:27.850
software that you used you started with

1:00:25.660,1:00:31.110
the sort of basic word processing did

1:00:27.850,1:00:34.720
you move to an Apple word processing

1:00:31.110,1:00:38.230
software or was it like WordPerfect or

1:00:34.720,1:00:40.210
you remember I mean I can't even me no

1:00:38.230,1:00:41.860
no gosh I'm not going to be able to

1:00:40.210,1:00:44.020
remember all the different program names

1:00:41.860,1:00:46.510
but yeah and now are using Microsoft

1:00:44.020,1:00:49.510
Word uh-huh okay but you're also using

1:00:46.510,1:00:51.550
pages yeah so so you're looking between

1:00:49.510,1:00:55.540
software there has that been a newer

1:00:51.550,1:00:58.240
thing since the iPad or yeah I may get a

1:00:55.540,1:01:00.390
new iPad pretty soon up and I don't I

1:00:58.240,1:01:03.370
don't know if I want to buy another

1:01:00.390,1:01:06.130
Microsoft Word you know yeah I'm getting

1:01:03.370,1:01:09.010
agencies next time yeah it moves can't

1:01:06.130,1:01:15.680
afford to find great great

1:01:09.010,1:01:18.360
but I learned um Photoshop okay

1:01:15.680,1:01:23.430
when I was magazine editor

1:01:18.360,1:01:24.060
I edited Willow Springs for about six

1:01:23.430,1:01:27.150
years

1:01:24.060,1:01:29.220
and so I've learned that what's in 1990

1:01:27.150,1:01:31.580
he took over the editorship of that

1:01:29.220,1:01:36.800
magazine when I came out to Eastern and

1:01:31.580,1:01:40.070
they they were doing the magazine with

1:01:36.800,1:01:43.170
there was null computer technology the

1:01:40.070,1:01:49.740
woman who had done it before me was like

1:01:43.170,1:01:51.570
she was into the light board thing which

1:01:49.740,1:01:54.780
I had learnt which I had learned in

1:01:51.570,1:01:57.720
college I in journalism class you know

1:01:54.780,1:01:59.760
with the sticky pili thing you really

1:01:57.720,1:02:02.430
like you I actually saw this in high

1:01:59.760,1:02:05.100
school in my journalism class - yes and

1:02:02.430,1:02:08.790
I could not believe that that they had

1:02:05.100,1:02:11.520
no computer program or anything so a guy

1:02:08.790,1:02:14.490
in the journalism department gave me a

1:02:11.520,1:02:16.500
copy page maker to put on the computer

1:02:14.490,1:02:22.230
and I instantly fell in love with it

1:02:16.500,1:02:24.030
yeah I just oh I loved us I love doing

1:02:22.230,1:02:26.130
the art for the magazine I did the

1:02:24.030,1:02:28.740
covers you know I mean I found the art

1:02:26.130,1:02:32.000
and made the covers myself because there

1:02:28.740,1:02:35.460
was nobody else to do it right and so I

1:02:32.000,1:02:38.250
learned pagemaker at the very beginning

1:02:35.460,1:02:42.530
when it was just out and then she

1:02:38.250,1:02:45.840
probably know that became social so I

1:02:42.530,1:02:49.590
just kind of stayed with it on all these

1:02:45.840,1:02:56.910
years and now easily sorted out this one

1:02:49.590,1:02:59.730
of years Wow and you know I buy every

1:02:56.910,1:03:01.530
other Photoshop fests that's been my mo

1:02:59.730,1:03:05.640
I don't try to keep up with every single

1:03:01.530,1:03:07.860
new one so I'm on five now but I will

1:03:05.640,1:03:08.880
probably get seven with I'm a little

1:03:07.860,1:03:10.230
worried that they're not going to do

1:03:08.880,1:03:12.720
that anymore they seem to be moving

1:03:10.230,1:03:15.720
sabbatical a subscription basis you

1:03:12.720,1:03:17.220
really yeah how do you mean well you

1:03:15.720,1:03:20.580
know we buy it a lot for the digital

1:03:17.220,1:03:22.200
secures and I'm starting to hear that

1:03:20.580,1:03:23.880
there's you know they're offering it now

1:03:22.200,1:03:25.049
season you know basically pay a monthly

1:03:23.880,1:03:27.709
fee and get photos

1:03:25.049,1:03:30.959
or get in design or get the design suite

1:03:27.709,1:03:31.979
but that so I'm not sure how often if

1:03:30.959,1:03:34.049
they're going to be selling those like

1:03:31.979,1:03:34.649
student teachers kind of additions

1:03:34.049,1:03:36.329
anymore

1:03:34.649,1:03:38.729
Oh or if they're going to be charging a

1:03:36.329,1:03:39.779
subscription fee which in my mind is

1:03:38.729,1:03:41.189
going to be windmill expensive

1:03:39.779,1:03:42.419
assistance as we have so many topics it

1:03:41.189,1:03:45.630
might be cheaper overall for an

1:03:42.419,1:03:47.519
individual but interesting yeah so I'm

1:03:45.630,1:03:49.709
not sure I'm not actually positive about

1:03:47.519,1:03:56.309
that but I sort of have heard on the

1:03:49.709,1:04:00.289
wind that might be no wow that was okay

1:03:56.309,1:04:02.789
it's a tax write-off oh yeah yeah yeah

1:04:00.289,1:04:05.729
so you were you were pretty familiar

1:04:02.789,1:04:07.339
with computers from from pretty much

1:04:05.729,1:04:09.659
your most invisible professional career

1:04:07.339,1:04:12.209
as they became more prevalent in the

1:04:09.659,1:04:13.769
society at large did that effect I mean

1:04:12.209,1:04:15.179
I guess it affected probably your

1:04:13.769,1:04:17.939
correspondence with your editors and

1:04:15.179,1:04:19.769
whatnot in your saclink like that did

1:04:17.939,1:04:21.599
that affect anything in the way that you

1:04:19.769,1:04:27.289
write to do start to feel different it

1:04:21.599,1:04:28.529
writing feel different um it felt more

1:04:27.289,1:04:34.469
constant

1:04:28.529,1:04:37.409
I guess I'm my students at Vermont

1:04:34.469,1:04:42.179
College they want to send me their work

1:04:37.409,1:04:45.329
everything online now and I feel like I

1:04:42.179,1:04:48.989
cannot I cannot get away from sitting

1:04:45.329,1:04:54.239
here you know 10 hours 12 hours a day

1:04:48.989,1:04:58.769
and that's that part I I don't like as

1:04:54.239,1:05:01.259
much I I still I like reading you

1:04:58.769,1:05:02.880
knowing that in a comfy chair and I feel

1:05:01.259,1:05:05.309
like we're moving away from that now

1:05:02.880,1:05:07.529
because that's becoming less and I'm you

1:05:05.309,1:05:11.759
know I'm writing ebooks myself now so

1:05:07.529,1:05:13.589
yeah so I'm a culprit to free but I can

1:05:11.759,1:05:16.369
leave my iPad in a comfy chair

1:05:13.589,1:05:16.369
yes

1:05:18.220,1:05:24.070
I still like reading in bed but once I

1:05:21.850,1:05:37.420
discovered that I can read my iPad in

1:05:24.070,1:05:41.220
bed I was happy I am sort of interested

1:05:37.420,1:05:43.870
- I guess did sort of typographical or

1:05:41.220,1:05:45.340
more graphical things I mean you see

1:05:43.870,1:05:47.800
working familiar with PageMaker did that

1:05:45.340,1:05:49.870
did any of that like ability of the

1:05:47.800,1:05:51.700
computer to adjust or I mean like I like

1:05:49.870,1:05:53.950
I think in quake with those the breaks

1:05:51.700,1:05:55.570
that were kind of like speaks a lot my

1:05:53.950,1:05:58.290
kind of jagged lines I don't know where

1:05:55.570,1:06:01.840
those came from Aceves computer thing or

1:05:58.290,1:06:03.190
you don't talk about section breaks like

1:06:01.840,1:06:04.600
the breaks within the stories that would

1:06:03.190,1:06:08.110
be like yeah like section breaks they

1:06:04.600,1:06:10.090
had like kind of I think that might've

1:06:08.110,1:06:13.120
been the science book design or those

1:06:10.090,1:06:14.740
design okay but did any of that

1:06:13.120,1:06:16.660
influence your writing I mean did you

1:06:14.740,1:06:19.090
start to and then you obviously what

1:06:16.660,1:06:21.730
response and design aspects and layout

1:06:19.090,1:06:23.620
did that influence anything with your

1:06:21.730,1:06:25.480
poems I mean I know they also you know a

1:06:23.620,1:06:26.890
lot of them will have least the earlier

1:06:25.480,1:06:30.070
one some of them would move kind of tab

1:06:26.890,1:06:32.050
by tab and then I mean there's other

1:06:30.070,1:06:35.470
different sort of strategies in palms

1:06:32.050,1:06:37.750
too but there I don't know I mean I'm

1:06:35.470,1:06:44.860
trying to think about what you're asking

1:06:37.750,1:06:46.960
me because I just want remembering um or

1:06:44.860,1:06:49.600
if there's any particular way that that

1:06:46.960,1:06:51.520
changed in my writing itself yeah I mean

1:06:49.600,1:06:54.430
I don't think it wasn't I don't know

1:06:51.520,1:06:55.600
that I can say that it I guess when

1:06:54.430,1:06:56.470
you're writing in your note baby that's

1:06:55.600,1:06:58.930
the way to get when you're writing in

1:06:56.470,1:07:00.520
your notebook are you writing with sort

1:06:58.930,1:07:02.200
of indentation and other things like

1:07:00.520,1:07:07.750
that or are you pretty much down the

1:07:02.200,1:07:09.100
left margin to those who does that sort

1:07:07.750,1:07:10.510
of layout saying transfer to the

1:07:09.100,1:07:13.870
computer right you're right you know I

1:07:10.510,1:07:16.780
what little experimenting I've done

1:07:13.870,1:07:20.470
along those lines with poems I've done

1:07:16.780,1:07:23.980
on the computer screen sugar yeah I mean

1:07:20.470,1:07:26.260
that's I think my I know we're going to

1:07:23.980,1:07:29.200
talk about this later what I'm doing now

1:07:26.260,1:07:30.940
I'm doing these altered book pages right

1:07:29.200,1:07:32.700
you know if I showed you any of those

1:07:30.940,1:07:37.120
crystals are all blah

1:07:32.700,1:07:41.220
files but I'm doing these altered book

1:07:37.120,1:07:44.260
pages and those are that's where all

1:07:41.220,1:07:47.230
everything I know about Photoshop and my

1:07:44.260,1:07:51.550
poetry is like finally coming together

1:07:47.230,1:07:55.420
into something that feels more I don't

1:07:51.550,1:07:56.890
know my own yeah different so we can

1:07:55.420,1:07:58.800
talk about that everybody

1:07:56.890,1:08:04.750
so is that different than the photons

1:07:58.800,1:08:06.370
yeah okay yeah um what sort of for

1:08:04.750,1:08:12.820
tonight I'll show you

1:08:06.370,1:08:14.680
so I'm um I put these online I send this

1:08:12.820,1:08:19.030
is mainly what I've been publishing

1:08:14.680,1:08:24.490
lately I found this old encyclopedia up

1:08:19.030,1:08:28.210
here from the 30s and I've been scanning

1:08:24.490,1:08:32.110
the pages okay especially pages that

1:08:28.210,1:08:43.900
have a lot of graphic material in them

1:08:32.110,1:08:48.730
and yeah so I I put them on this website

1:08:43.900,1:08:52.240
but in a in a locked gallery cuz this is

1:08:48.730,1:08:55.930
how I share them then with editors oh ok

1:08:52.240,1:09:02.110
so let's see y'all try to find that it's

1:08:55.930,1:09:04.420
like Latino one here so Zenfolio is like

1:09:02.110,1:09:07.600
this like a webservice kind of yeah this

1:09:04.420,1:09:10.840
isn't really for photographers website

1:09:07.600,1:09:13.240
but I just liked it because it has a

1:09:10.840,1:09:16.030
really clean look yeah and their

1:09:13.240,1:09:17.740
slideshow mode is really nice yeah so

1:09:16.030,1:09:22.980
this is the book I'm doing with my

1:09:17.740,1:09:27.190
husband right now and these are his

1:09:22.980,1:09:32.470
these are his illustrations so I can

1:09:27.190,1:09:36.040
actually put this in slideshow you can

1:09:32.470,1:09:39.700
see that so this is my fiction project

1:09:36.040,1:09:42.490
okay that I'm busy the novella this is

1:09:39.700,1:09:44.290
yeah this I will only I haven't shared

1:09:42.490,1:09:46.000
this actually with any editors yet

1:09:44.290,1:09:53.880
because I'm only just putting this

1:09:46.000,1:09:58.330
online that's a section be lighter page

1:09:53.880,1:10:01.600
this is called a pull for stop so then

1:09:58.330,1:10:03.550
and then this story goes like this so

1:10:01.600,1:10:06.070
these are Rick's pieces and then I have

1:10:03.550,1:10:10.030
this little story that goes with these

1:10:06.070,1:10:12.280
characters in the book here and each

1:10:10.030,1:10:15.910
page I think of it as a little like

1:10:12.280,1:10:18.460
flash fiction yeah yeah so I kind of

1:10:15.910,1:10:20.530
think of them as linked flash fiction

1:10:18.460,1:10:23.650
and they're relating in some way to the

1:10:20.530,1:10:29.320
image oh yeah okay so that's that book

1:10:23.650,1:10:33.870
that book and I was telling you multi

1:10:29.320,1:10:33.870
encyclopedia and that's book of no ledge

1:10:34.920,1:10:42.970
and so this is how I send them out now

1:10:39.250,1:10:46.630
to editors hmm I'll probably send like

1:10:42.970,1:10:49.000
two or three of these pieces in you know

1:10:46.630,1:10:51.730
the online submission or whatever and

1:10:49.000,1:10:55.240
then I send them a link to this to this

1:10:51.730,1:10:57.250
gallery and the password that they need

1:10:55.240,1:11:01.360
to access it because the locked gallery

1:10:57.250,1:11:03.520
that way I can kind of track on you know

1:11:01.360,1:11:06.010
how many people are looking editors are

1:11:03.520,1:11:08.770
looking at myself at the same time right

1:11:06.010,1:11:11.560
and then when somebody takes a piece I

1:11:08.770,1:11:14.380
put these little asterisks this just

1:11:11.560,1:11:16.450
like screwed up things so they kind of

1:11:14.380,1:11:19.270
can realize all those are out of

1:11:16.450,1:11:26.400
commission then so that's what so now

1:11:19.270,1:11:29.290
I'm kind of actually putting a poem and

1:11:26.400,1:11:32.170
I hate all this fail stuff in here but

1:11:29.290,1:11:34.690
there's since then I'm actually kind of

1:11:32.170,1:11:39.010
replacing the text that was here in the

1:11:34.690,1:11:40.960
encyclopedia with a poem and and so

1:11:39.010,1:11:42.970
you'll do that in Photoshop like you'll

1:11:40.960,1:11:44.470
erase the text and then you'll are you

1:11:42.970,1:11:47.370
trying to match the font in some way it

1:11:44.470,1:11:50.020
looks like or at least kind of it I am

1:11:47.370,1:11:52.990
and then those are images from the text

1:11:50.020,1:11:56.260
originally yes actually they're from

1:11:52.990,1:12:00.100
like three different pages in the text

1:11:56.260,1:12:02.700
and then I've colorized them to Carlini

1:12:00.100,1:12:05.260
project it's really been fun I like I

1:12:02.700,1:12:07.239
like doing that you can see I've kind of

1:12:05.260,1:12:11.920
done a little bit of a racer stuff in

1:12:07.239,1:12:15.220
here yeah and then this part is my poem

1:12:11.920,1:12:18.690
over here so I like as I said put these

1:12:15.220,1:12:27.880
in slideshow cos they're come out water

1:12:18.690,1:12:32.020
but I kind of like having a mix of what

1:12:27.880,1:12:35.920
would be encyclopedia language with naps

1:12:32.020,1:12:40.660
talk kind of I like going back and forth

1:12:35.920,1:12:43.360
so that's this has been where I've

1:12:40.660,1:12:47.320
really started to use the technology

1:12:43.360,1:12:51.210
much more than I was before so I have

1:12:47.320,1:12:54.370
all those people this is the straight

1:12:51.210,1:12:57.340
cyclopædia man stuff and I hope they

1:12:54.370,1:13:04.780
kind of talk back and forth to each

1:12:57.340,1:13:07.450
other the language yeah no I see what

1:13:04.780,1:13:10.510
you're saying my language here in their

1:13:07.450,1:13:12.010
language and well I'm sorry it's sort of

1:13:10.510,1:13:15.190
like contextualizes and sort of

1:13:12.010,1:13:17.260
decontextualize isn't it yeah yes my

1:13:15.190,1:13:21.400
little conversation with proof I've been

1:13:17.260,1:13:27.700
reading proof to shared I see improves

1:13:21.400,1:13:29.860
there on a timeout right now anyway

1:13:27.700,1:13:31.780
that's Alaska thing looks like I like

1:13:29.860,1:13:33.880
the pate I like the pages from the

1:13:31.780,1:13:38.080
encyclopedia that have all this graphic

1:13:33.880,1:13:41.920
material so I can um I kind of take what

1:13:38.080,1:13:45.070
was you know I what I have I put all

1:13:41.920,1:13:49.180
these kind of romance words around in

1:13:45.070,1:13:51.400
this one timber Wolf's love nipped not

1:13:49.180,1:13:53.950
skok soulmate I gave them kind of

1:13:51.400,1:13:56.050
anything yeah different a merciless

1:13:53.950,1:13:58.060
but a person would have to sort of go in

1:13:56.050,1:14:01.330
there and look a little bit right that's

1:13:58.060,1:14:05.830
ready to see yeah I mean yeah I mean it

1:14:01.330,1:14:08.020
is to pay attention salt that's that's

1:14:05.830,1:14:09.729
where things have sort of evolved

1:14:08.020,1:14:13.209
computerized from

1:14:09.729,1:14:15.099
and how does that I mean what's the like

1:14:13.209,1:14:16.749
does it feel different is it disorder

1:14:15.099,1:14:18.969
that seem like the same creative process

1:14:16.749,1:14:21.940
for you I mean I mean it's visual and

1:14:18.969,1:14:24.309
textual so there's that but in terms of

1:14:21.940,1:14:29.139
using the computer to make is that a

1:14:24.309,1:14:31.959
change well so the way I've been I have

1:14:29.139,1:14:33.699
some really interesting different ways

1:14:31.959,1:14:37.209
that I've been doing these that have

1:14:33.699,1:14:40.380
never been even remotely like working on

1:14:37.209,1:14:44.979
the palms of stories so I'll print out

1:14:40.380,1:14:47.559
first the original scans and black and

1:14:44.979,1:14:49.209
white and that's what I carry around in

1:14:47.559,1:14:52.030
my little notebook you know I'm so

1:14:49.209,1:14:53.650
fixated to the notebook there so I'm

1:14:52.030,1:14:55.420
carrying those around the notebook and

1:14:53.650,1:14:58.420
then I just actually just start

1:14:55.420,1:15:03.429
scribbling on the pages scribbling stuff

1:14:58.420,1:15:05.739
out I'm one of the things that I'm kind

1:15:03.429,1:15:09.789
of doing with this book project with the

1:15:05.739,1:15:13.929
encyclopedia is this is my version of a

1:15:09.789,1:15:18.219
Collected Poems of Nance Van Winkle so

1:15:13.929,1:15:21.820
I'm kind of mining some of my early

1:15:18.219,1:15:23.679
poems because I the idea of doing a

1:15:21.820,1:15:26.440
collected or selected or something is

1:15:23.679,1:15:29.320
kind of boring to me actually okay but

1:15:26.440,1:15:31.690
this made it more interesting to do yes

1:15:29.320,1:15:34.929
because I'll just pull out oh I always

1:15:31.690,1:15:38.139
like this Danson yeah I like to stand

1:15:34.929,1:15:41.409
and then I you forget the rest of that

1:15:38.139,1:15:44.409
foam you know but these five lines I

1:15:41.409,1:15:47.530
like so I'll sprinkle them in there and

1:15:44.409,1:15:51.159
it's been fun to kind of find the visual

1:15:47.530,1:15:54.159
material that I think they fit with yeah

1:15:51.159,1:15:56.229
so anyway I'm so wealth of human

1:15:54.159,1:16:00.249
knowledge from thirty thirty well

1:15:56.229,1:16:04.360
exactly exactly and you know I feel like

1:16:00.249,1:16:05.739
I'm kind of talking I am I said one of

1:16:04.360,1:16:08.499
the things that's going on in this

1:16:05.739,1:16:15.329
project is I'm talking back to history

1:16:08.499,1:16:19.570
in a way and say no that's not right and

1:16:15.329,1:16:21.189
I like that I like that Marisa and I

1:16:19.570,1:16:24.099
guess in some ways the software allows

1:16:21.189,1:16:26.559
you more

1:16:24.099,1:16:28.630
purchase on making them deletion and

1:16:26.559,1:16:33.460
adjustment exactly and it would have

1:16:28.630,1:16:34.449
really crossing out or like board right

1:16:33.460,1:16:35.980
yeah

1:16:34.449,1:16:38.409
and the erase you're saying you know

1:16:35.980,1:16:40.210
that a lot of people are doing yeah that

1:16:38.409,1:16:43.059
seems like you know I'm good friends

1:16:40.210,1:16:46.239
with Mary rueful through an amazing

1:16:43.059,1:16:48.670
resource every yeah I feel like I could

1:16:46.239,1:16:51.610
run up Mary rueful I'm not doing that

1:16:48.670,1:16:53.760
I'm not going there there are people who

1:16:51.610,1:16:56.590
are doing that so much better

1:16:53.760,1:16:59.440
I've always been a fan of it that Robbie

1:16:56.590,1:17:01.630
off to paradise block leashes around uh

1:16:59.440,1:17:07.210
uh how did this team like you're gonna

1:17:01.630,1:17:11.500
yeah and I weigh who did one like oh he

1:17:07.210,1:17:13.750
didn't really happy birth mirrors yeah a

1:17:11.500,1:17:14.969
lot I think maybe too many people jumped

1:17:13.750,1:17:17.679
on the eraser its

1:17:14.969,1:17:19.239
bandwagon it's but it's hot I mean it's

1:17:17.679,1:17:21.579
really I mean to do it in the latest

1:17:19.239,1:17:23.530
miracle so it is really really hard I

1:17:21.579,1:17:27.340
mean like yeah here's something area was

1:17:23.530,1:17:30.039
all set the way I do it is I look at the

1:17:27.340,1:17:32.349
page and then pretty soon if I just

1:17:30.039,1:17:44.710
stare at it for a while a few words

1:17:32.349,1:17:53.619
slowed up good okay oh oh

1:17:44.710,1:17:57.480
eliwood so words flowed up into a lot of

1:17:53.619,1:17:57.480
these questions in the course of it

1:18:08.270,1:18:12.610
Oh can you find your files like if

1:18:11.000,1:18:16.910
you're looking for like a certain phone

1:18:12.610,1:18:18.740
on your computer would you if you have

1:18:16.910,1:18:20.420
difficulty locating them or are you is

1:18:18.740,1:18:27.230
your organization such that you pretty

1:18:20.420,1:18:30.410
much know where things are I have lost I

1:18:27.230,1:18:34.040
have lost things and yeah almost every

1:18:30.410,1:18:36.580
week I have a little battle because I

1:18:34.040,1:18:40.880
can't remember why I called something

1:18:36.580,1:18:42.860
yeah yeah do you worry at all about the

1:18:40.880,1:18:48.110
security or some fixity of these digital

1:18:42.860,1:18:50.870
files no no you mean somebody else

1:18:48.110,1:18:54.560
accessing them or something that Jeremy

1:18:50.870,1:18:56.360
or the kind of fidelity of them I guess

1:18:54.560,1:18:58.070
I mean visitors I mean you do say that

1:18:56.360,1:18:59.780
you have floppy disks and old Word

1:18:58.070,1:19:01.820
Perfect documents or something that you

1:18:59.780,1:19:03.110
can't access that is that a concern to

1:19:01.820,1:19:04.600
you or you just think that will kind of

1:19:03.110,1:19:08.780
take care of itself

1:19:04.600,1:19:11.000
um it's not a concern to me maybe it

1:19:08.780,1:19:13.400
should be no I don't I actually don't

1:19:11.000,1:19:16.640
think it should be but um and I'm I'm

1:19:13.400,1:19:17.750
wanting to know that so okay but I mean

1:19:16.640,1:19:19.310
that yeah there's definitely things we

1:19:17.750,1:19:21.320
can do but I mean it's one of those

1:19:19.310,1:19:23.630
things that I think well I guess the

1:19:21.320,1:19:25.130
other question is have the changes in

1:19:23.630,1:19:29.360
computers I mean like you know probably

1:19:25.130,1:19:31.970
in the 98 90s early 90s computers

1:19:29.360,1:19:34.100
crashed much more often more likely to

1:19:31.970,1:19:37.480
lose work too bad ever influence the way

1:19:34.100,1:19:39.920
that you work on computers or was that

1:19:37.480,1:19:43.640
were you pretty much kept the same

1:19:39.920,1:19:46.040
strategies I have pretty much kept the

1:19:43.640,1:19:49.580
same strategy she no I've never had a

1:19:46.040,1:19:52.070
really bad thing happen where I've lost

1:19:49.580,1:20:01.010
the hard drive or anything like that I

1:19:52.070,1:20:04.190
know I know and you know they got you

1:20:01.010,1:20:09.110
bigger they really do I I just I love

1:20:04.190,1:20:10.910
all their products as I could so a few

1:20:09.110,1:20:12.620
questions are correspondences teaching

1:20:10.910,1:20:15.270
all the way to sever sabbatical couple

1:20:12.620,1:20:19.119
episode m and another view

1:20:15.270,1:20:21.040
so you have you ever correspondent very

1:20:19.119,1:20:23.230
much in like like physical letters has

1:20:21.040,1:20:24.639
that ever been a person or but I mean

1:20:23.230,1:20:26.080
play to your writing I don't need to

1:20:24.639,1:20:27.550
know you know the personal

1:20:26.080,1:20:30.690
correspondence not so much but I mean

1:20:27.550,1:20:35.349
like writing wise to realize that ever

1:20:30.690,1:20:37.060
no physical letters I well like I was

1:20:35.349,1:20:39.190
telling you with that first book of

1:20:37.060,1:20:44.590
poems I've kept all the letters that he

1:20:39.190,1:20:47.760
wrote to me about revision yeah I don't

1:20:44.590,1:20:50.139
know they just they're very dear to me

1:20:47.760,1:20:54.159
that somebody took that kind of time

1:20:50.139,1:20:56.500
with me and and then I have a good

1:20:54.159,1:20:59.290
friend who's a poet I think I mentioned

1:20:56.500,1:21:01.599
her to you Jennifer Boyd muse and she

1:20:59.290,1:21:03.520
really loves the physical letter and

1:21:01.599,1:21:05.530
I've kept all her letters that she's

1:21:03.520,1:21:08.380
written me over the years because

1:21:05.530,1:21:15.400
they're just beautiful and and it just

1:21:08.380,1:21:18.280
always seems like just the idea that

1:21:15.400,1:21:20.639
somebody is writing this just to me you

1:21:18.280,1:21:23.619
know the three page letter with her

1:21:20.639,1:21:25.500
thoughts and ruminations about things

1:21:23.619,1:21:28.719
and they're just so beautifully written

1:21:25.500,1:21:32.619
but she would take the time to do that

1:21:28.719,1:21:36.040
you know it's it seems like a treasure

1:21:32.619,1:21:38.400
thing because it's passing but do I do

1:21:36.040,1:21:38.400
it

1:21:39.610,1:21:45.880
do you have any similar feelings for

1:21:42.520,1:21:52.330
anything yes you have email but you to

1:21:45.880,1:21:56.230
feel fear about oh I do keep some emails

1:21:52.330,1:22:00.010
I have you know files these emails that

1:21:56.230,1:22:01.270
I keep from certain people a minute and

1:22:00.010,1:22:04.690
it's a corollary to that do you feel

1:22:01.270,1:22:06.489
like a this is an odd question but do

1:22:04.690,1:22:09.849
you have any sort of feelings towards

1:22:06.489,1:22:12.040
your digital files about yet your poem

1:22:09.849,1:22:13.330
you feel like are they dear to you in

1:22:12.040,1:22:18.010
the same way maybe a notebook would be

1:22:13.330,1:22:20.469
here you or no no the notebook is dearer

1:22:18.010,1:22:24.699
okay I don't know I don't know what

1:22:20.469,1:22:26.460
that's weird touch it is could it be

1:22:24.699,1:22:28.630
part of it is

1:22:26.460,1:22:30.370
yeah there's me I don't know yeah it's

1:22:28.630,1:22:31.840
one of those one of those things I don't

1:22:30.370,1:22:33.640
know if that will change

1:22:31.840,1:22:36.340
like if someone never had but this is

1:22:33.640,1:22:38.110
cool in the future it would have the

1:22:36.340,1:22:41.250
special folder on the desktop that just

1:22:38.110,1:22:47.220
to talk to me but you know I try to be

1:22:41.250,1:22:50.650
careful that I've always got a hardcopy

1:22:47.220,1:22:52.630
somewhere the material I'm working I

1:22:50.650,1:22:54.780
like this book that I'm doing with my

1:22:52.630,1:23:00.760
husband okay

1:22:54.780,1:23:05.680
and there they all are because and the

1:23:00.760,1:23:09.120
way that well to finish that that

1:23:05.680,1:23:12.820
thought about just being careful because

1:23:09.120,1:23:16.030
it's just if things go awry here I

1:23:12.820,1:23:19.180
really I don't want to lose the work

1:23:16.030,1:23:21.370
completely free so I try to make sure

1:23:19.180,1:23:23.650
that I have a hard copy it's not always

1:23:21.370,1:23:28.030
the most recent copy yeah but there's

1:23:23.650,1:23:32.950
there's the coffee right so and with

1:23:28.030,1:23:35.170
this book I did all of the arranging of

1:23:32.950,1:23:37.930
it I stuck them on that wall in the

1:23:35.170,1:23:41.320
hallway okay and all the pages were on

1:23:37.930,1:23:43.330
that wall and I was moving I had little

1:23:41.320,1:23:46.450
sticky things on the back and I was

1:23:43.330,1:23:49.300
moving them around to make the sections

1:23:46.450,1:23:50.020
of the book for it was up there for like

1:23:49.300,1:23:53.800
three months

1:23:50.020,1:23:55.270
yeah three three months off so you would

1:23:53.800,1:23:57.280
just would you come home and see them

1:23:55.270,1:23:59.230
and make a few changes or was it

1:23:57.280,1:24:03.940
basically be a dedicated time that you

1:23:59.230,1:24:05.800
go to it er um well it was I was at that

1:24:03.940,1:24:08.920
stage with the book or I had all these

1:24:05.800,1:24:11.530
pages but I wasn't exactly sure you know

1:24:08.920,1:24:14.770
how I was going to arrange the the

1:24:11.530,1:24:17.440
chronology again on the story yeah so I

1:24:14.770,1:24:22.240
started experimenting with different

1:24:17.440,1:24:24.670
orders of things by putting this China

1:24:22.240,1:24:27.520
sections on the on the boards on the

1:24:24.670,1:24:30.820
wall that way yeah moving them around so

1:24:27.520,1:24:35.830
because s so before I had each page as

1:24:30.820,1:24:37.330
its own file in there and now and now

1:24:35.830,1:24:39.430
they have sections to

1:24:37.330,1:24:42.370
section I think they're five sections in

1:24:39.430,1:24:46.000
the book and those came from the wall

1:24:42.370,1:24:48.850
yeah okay so but I had to I could not

1:24:46.000,1:24:51.400
figure out a way to look at that many

1:24:48.850,1:24:55.060
pages on the screen at one time and I

1:24:51.400,1:24:58.480
mean actually see the print okay that

1:24:55.060,1:25:01.060
was yeah I felt like I the technology

1:24:58.480,1:25:08.560
wasn't allowing me to see the big

1:25:01.060,1:25:11.520
picture the way I needed to I'm sure

1:25:08.560,1:25:15.220
they're coming after they're here yeah

1:25:11.520,1:25:22.560
exactly yeah you too big wall this is

1:25:15.220,1:25:25.920
you and if Mac makes it I'm buying it is

1:25:22.560,1:25:30.130
only going to be a million dollars yeah

1:25:25.920,1:25:32.950
I guess we did talk a little bit about

1:25:30.130,1:25:34.540
your teaching and that you do correspond

1:25:32.950,1:25:39.520
by email with your students mostly is

1:25:34.540,1:25:43.690
that um now if they insist on it okay

1:25:39.520,1:25:45.550
I'm sending me their work as attachments

1:25:43.690,1:25:47.590
and everything I'll read it that way I

1:25:45.550,1:25:49.630
don't like doing it with the poet's with

1:25:47.590,1:25:51.970
the fiction people I was much much

1:25:49.630,1:25:54.850
rather they send me their work in the

1:25:51.970,1:25:56.800
mail okay and usually they're okay with

1:25:54.850,1:25:58.690
them you kind of take it and not have to

1:25:56.800,1:26:01.870
be connected and not have to and then

1:25:58.690,1:26:05.260
yeah yeah and I just I do not like

1:26:01.870,1:26:08.760
writing my comments laundress in with

1:26:05.260,1:26:12.370
the blackboard program or any of those

1:26:08.760,1:26:14.980
the college has that available to us and

1:26:12.370,1:26:17.770
I have done track changes in word I know

1:26:14.980,1:26:20.650
how to use that okay but I just I just

1:26:17.770,1:26:22.420
like to scribble in the largest right so

1:26:20.650,1:26:24.180
something that in that aspect of your

1:26:22.420,1:26:27.660
work and your life like you just

1:26:24.180,1:26:30.190
ultimately prefer physical

1:26:27.660,1:26:30.820
correspondence pull in yeah cool yeah

1:26:30.190,1:26:35.560
okay

1:26:30.820,1:26:38.410
yeah and then I guess the other thing

1:26:35.560,1:26:39.970
with with like writing and distraction I

1:26:38.410,1:26:41.260
guess is it's like when are you

1:26:39.970,1:26:42.790
connected to the internet when you're

1:26:41.260,1:26:45.160
writing do you ever have to like do it

1:26:42.790,1:26:46.280
like disconnect turn off your Wi-Fi or

1:26:45.160,1:26:50.300
something

1:26:46.280,1:26:52.250
Bravo one concern for you before you use

1:26:50.300,1:26:55.130
they are you think looking things up

1:26:52.250,1:26:58.670
while you're writing wrong that's a good

1:26:55.130,1:27:00.980
question um I don't like to be

1:26:58.670,1:27:04.430
disconnected from the net anymore yeah

1:27:00.980,1:27:08.590
it's terrible yeah I like to check in

1:27:04.430,1:27:08.590
with my peeps all the time now three and

1:27:08.650,1:27:15.950
yeah I I mean I use the dictionary on

1:27:12.260,1:27:21.770
here all the time because it's just so

1:27:15.950,1:27:24.230
much faster yeah elated so it's a tool

1:27:21.770,1:27:26.600
whether in whatever writing space you're

1:27:24.230,1:27:28.340
in is be it notebook or not you're still

1:27:26.600,1:27:31.910
using experience also assist you

1:27:28.340,1:27:34.370
yeah and I'm always I've always got

1:27:31.910,1:27:36.920
something going on that's like what you

1:27:34.370,1:27:42.140
know like right now and talking to

1:27:36.920,1:27:43.640
agents and if they email me if I see an

1:27:42.140,1:27:45.350
email come in while I'm actually working

1:27:43.640,1:27:47.590
on something I've got to go see with

1:27:45.350,1:27:52.760
that so that is that from my agent right

1:27:47.590,1:27:55.280
great um so present in that distraction

1:27:52.760,1:27:59.240
point of it's not a real concerns of you

1:27:55.280,1:28:01.610
and you see you are producing closes it

1:27:59.240,1:28:05.810
once more when I was younger but I guess

1:28:01.610,1:28:08.930
maybe I'm learning how to how'd it go

1:28:05.810,1:28:12.320
back and how to disconnect from it and

1:28:08.930,1:28:14.750
go back to my work pretty fast then has

1:28:12.320,1:28:16.640
there been something found to help do

1:28:14.750,1:28:17.960
that mean like what we need if you're

1:28:16.640,1:28:21.290
distinguishing between your younger

1:28:17.960,1:28:24.800
working and now I guess maybe just like

1:28:21.290,1:28:28.100
a lot of younger people I'm just more

1:28:24.800,1:28:30.110
used to being attached to it you know I

1:28:28.100,1:28:34.520
I'll have my I'll be doing something on

1:28:30.110,1:28:38.180
my iPad communicating with somebody or

1:28:34.520,1:28:42.100
talking on Facebook or whatever well

1:28:38.180,1:28:45.650
Rick and I are watching a movie at night

1:28:42.100,1:28:47.450
so I'm there's much more multitasking

1:28:45.650,1:28:54.410
sort of way to compartmentalize yeah

1:28:47.450,1:28:56.690
seems pretty seamless yeah when I guess

1:28:54.410,1:28:58.130
that's question about teaching like when

1:28:56.690,1:28:59.530
you when you've had now you're probably

1:28:58.130,1:29:02.239
getting students to groan

1:28:59.530,1:29:03.980
only with the computer right and that

1:29:02.239,1:29:05.710
changed your relationship to it I mean

1:29:03.980,1:29:08.480
has that sort of changed your idea about

1:29:05.710,1:29:08.770
what it does its effects anything like

1:29:08.480,1:29:13.960
that

1:29:08.770,1:29:18.190
well it's changed to the sense that and

1:29:13.960,1:29:20.630
when students talk to me about their own

1:29:18.190,1:29:22.850
composing process and of course they

1:29:20.630,1:29:25.429
they do everything on the computer they

1:29:22.850,1:29:28.130
don't they don't ever a lot of them

1:29:25.429,1:29:33.920
write anything at all in longhand yes I

1:29:28.130,1:29:36.949
don't even know if they can and and so I

1:29:33.920,1:29:41.929
I'm ok with that I feel like I've sort

1:29:36.949,1:29:46.040
of made my peace that they if people are

1:29:41.929,1:29:48.590
perfectly able to write to find a good

1:29:46.040,1:29:51.590
composition process that works for them

1:29:48.590,1:29:55.370
that doesn't have to do with paper and

1:29:51.590,1:29:57.500
pens at all and thought I'm accepting of

1:29:55.370,1:30:01.370
that you know I don't try to like shove

1:29:57.500,1:30:02.929
my process off or say to Phyllis have

1:30:01.370,1:30:05.870
you ever thought you might like to write

1:30:02.929,1:30:10.610
it on a piece of paper first let's know

1:30:05.870,1:30:12.860
why I know I know that I'm I'm hanging

1:30:10.610,1:30:17.510
onto something that's if you were to pen

1:30:12.860,1:30:19.550
the pan of the paper to me they have

1:30:17.510,1:30:21.500
some there's something else going on

1:30:19.550,1:30:24.860
between the eye and the hand and the

1:30:21.500,1:30:26.239
page you know yeah and I still feel that

1:30:24.860,1:30:27.770
when I'm working

1:30:26.239,1:30:29.210
especially on poems that there's

1:30:27.770,1:30:31.790
something happening between the eye and

1:30:29.210,1:30:34.310
the fingers and and the page that's very

1:30:31.790,1:30:37.160
tactile that eyes I'm hanging on to that

1:30:34.310,1:30:38.690
I like and so you so you would say read

1:30:37.160,1:30:40.400
it for those that are only composing on

1:30:38.690,1:30:42.050
the computer and not never going to

1:30:40.400,1:30:43.969
handwriting or never using handwriting

1:30:42.050,1:30:46.640
at all that's what they're missing that

1:30:43.969,1:30:48.800
sort of Andy I don't know I don't think

1:30:46.640,1:30:51.679
they necessarily are missing it I think

1:30:48.800,1:30:53.900
they've they probably learn or are

1:30:51.679,1:30:56.120
learning to a step in the composing

1:30:53.900,1:30:57.679
process you know that maybe that thing

1:30:56.120,1:31:00.710
where you're writing with your eyes

1:30:57.679,1:31:02.690
closed yeah I mean the sake but if they

1:31:00.710,1:31:06.250
grow up with that and so they get the

1:31:02.690,1:31:10.730
same whatever imaginative connection

1:31:06.250,1:31:15.710
with the keyboard do you find that there

1:31:10.730,1:31:28.430
as open to revision as maybe an older

1:31:15.710,1:31:32.030
student well they can be made to they

1:31:28.430,1:31:34.400
can make something and that's just part

1:31:32.030,1:31:35.720
of the learning process right you don't

1:31:34.400,1:31:39.190
think if anything distinct to this

1:31:35.720,1:31:42.740
generation no I think they just have too

1:31:39.190,1:31:46.970
many of them some of them get it right

1:31:42.740,1:31:49.160
away that that revising can actually

1:31:46.970,1:31:51.380
make a work better yeah you know I've

1:31:49.160,1:31:53.420
been working with this woman right now

1:31:51.380,1:31:56.060
who came in saying that she doesn't like

1:31:53.420,1:31:58.070
to revise because she likes to just sit

1:31:56.060,1:32:01.150
down write everything out really fast in

1:31:58.070,1:32:05.660
one big draft and her stuff is a mess

1:32:01.150,1:32:10.000
and so it's my personal mission with her

1:32:05.660,1:32:14.060
to help her to come to believe that

1:32:10.000,1:32:17.150
actually revising or working in some

1:32:14.060,1:32:21.020
other manner you know like maybe having

1:32:17.150,1:32:24.260
writing off scene at a time what would

1:32:21.020,1:32:27.650
benefit the work but she's very young

1:32:24.260,1:32:30.650
and her first she never she didn't even

1:32:27.650,1:32:31.610
have an undergraduate degree in the

1:32:30.650,1:32:34.840
writing fall

1:32:31.610,1:32:42.380
she's starting it yeah Claire one yeah

1:32:34.840,1:32:45.560
okay well so that's kind of discussion

1:32:42.380,1:32:47.240
to have her about the programs and but I

1:32:45.560,1:32:49.250
guess you have you have a number of

1:32:47.240,1:32:53.840
distinct indeed being a sort of primary

1:32:49.250,1:32:56.060
of computer assisted project but you

1:32:53.840,1:32:59.810
have several going at the same time

1:32:56.060,1:33:03.100
seems including the collected your

1:32:59.810,1:33:07.370
novella are there other projects as well

1:33:03.100,1:33:10.220
okay and are they are they supplanting

1:33:07.370,1:33:14.390
your fiction and poetry writing or are

1:33:10.220,1:33:16.640
they sort of just in addition to I am

1:33:14.390,1:33:21.320
wrestling with this question myself I

1:33:16.640,1:33:23.539
think poetry right now the new poetry is

1:33:21.320,1:33:27.650
kind of going into the

1:33:23.539,1:33:31.369
so these altered book pages done doing I

1:33:27.650,1:33:36.980
have four four of those projects going

1:33:31.369,1:33:44.420
on right now and I am working on a book

1:33:36.980,1:33:46.670
of regular poems of prose poems but the

1:33:44.420,1:33:51.679
all the fiction I'm working are all

1:33:46.670,1:33:53.900
ebooks now I just completed novella not

1:33:51.679,1:33:58.489
this one but a different one that's an

1:33:53.900,1:34:03.019
e-book that's in the form of a scrapbook

1:33:58.489,1:34:05.329
photograph album and that's that's the

1:34:03.019,1:34:09.469
one I'm kind of taught the agents about

1:34:05.329,1:34:11.840
okay and they're going to and you you

1:34:09.469,1:34:15.429
you have only you don't expect to see a

1:34:11.840,1:34:19.280
physical form at all either this is the

1:34:15.429,1:34:23.090
question that we are trying to work

1:34:19.280,1:34:27.949
through I don't care about seeing it as

1:34:23.090,1:34:29.989
a print book but apparently the

1:34:27.949,1:34:32.960
publishers don't want to take a book

1:34:29.989,1:34:34.099
unless they can also have it as a print

1:34:32.960,1:34:41.300
book because they don't make any money

1:34:34.099,1:34:43.969
on the ebooks so yeah so an agent

1:34:41.300,1:34:50.269
doesn't want to take me on at the client

1:34:43.969,1:34:54.559
unless I am doing the print book and the

1:34:50.269,1:34:57.019
e-book is a sort of bonus okay

1:34:54.559,1:34:58.760
so that's what we're kind of going

1:34:57.019,1:35:00.860
around and around about and then I think

1:34:58.760,1:35:01.039
well maybe I'll just go out there and do

1:35:00.860,1:35:04.789
it

1:35:01.039,1:35:06.920
Oh try to do it with an e-book publisher

1:35:04.789,1:35:11.809
who is just doing that so I'm just

1:35:06.920,1:35:13.880
trying I just I'm just this is all new

1:35:11.809,1:35:16.250
to me and I new territory and I'm just

1:35:13.880,1:35:18.800
trying to navigate it myself right now

1:35:16.250,1:35:21.469
I don't know what I'm doing yeah what is

1:35:18.800,1:35:23.030
in in terms of like the process and the

1:35:21.469,1:35:26.329
competition everything it still seems

1:35:23.030,1:35:28.280
pretty much you know computer mouse

1:35:26.329,1:35:29.570
computer that is so like account well I

1:35:28.280,1:35:32.679
mean the computer is a big part of this

1:35:29.570,1:35:34.989
but still writing the notebook enforcing

1:35:32.679,1:35:37.060
or is it a lot of that still happening

1:35:34.989,1:35:39.730
are the ebooks happening on the computer

1:35:37.060,1:35:45.070
no I'm storing the text part in the

1:35:39.730,1:35:47.980
notebook how does the sort of visual

1:35:45.070,1:35:52.510
aspect relate fact here writing

1:35:47.980,1:35:54.130
especially sort of maybe I mean you use

1:35:52.510,1:35:57.310
a lot of imagery in your poems in a

1:35:54.130,1:36:00.340
musician but now you're actually using

1:35:57.310,1:36:02.440
images so what's what's that what's that

1:36:00.340,1:36:04.719
feel like are you so using them in the

1:36:02.440,1:36:08.230
same way to use imagery or is it a

1:36:04.719,1:36:10.570
totally different well I mean you hit it

1:36:08.230,1:36:12.699
right on the head that's it exactly I

1:36:10.570,1:36:16.150
mean everything I loved about poetry

1:36:12.699,1:36:21.640
that you know the image things yes now

1:36:16.150,1:36:23.770
I'm making actual images and you know

1:36:21.640,1:36:28.810
I'm putting a little bit of text in

1:36:23.770,1:36:31.390
there and you know now I'm starting your

1:36:28.810,1:36:35.530
ruffle with well that's too much text

1:36:31.390,1:36:39.489
you know it's everything that's

1:36:35.530,1:36:42.940
happening now has gotten to be less less

1:36:39.489,1:36:44.710
and less tests yes trying I'm trying to

1:36:42.940,1:36:48.340
find the right balance between the

1:36:44.710,1:36:52.000
visual component on this on the piece

1:36:48.340,1:36:54.520
and certain that sort of means minimal

1:36:52.000,1:36:56.920
text I think yeah so that they don't

1:36:54.520,1:37:00.219
fight each other I mean so what is that

1:36:56.920,1:37:02.890
I mean what is like how do you find the

1:37:00.219,1:37:04.590
right language for that what sort is

1:37:02.890,1:37:07.090
that I mean that seems like a different

1:37:04.590,1:37:09.670
but different almost a different things

1:37:07.090,1:37:15.070
in writing poetry and yeah yeah and that

1:37:09.670,1:37:19.750
I mean see see see just this is what for

1:37:15.070,1:37:22.150
me when I turned 60 and I I'm doing this

1:37:19.750,1:37:25.719
work it's made it exciting again like

1:37:22.150,1:37:30.130
when I was 20 yeah because I am language

1:37:25.719,1:37:32.820
of Scott ins it's been refreshed by this

1:37:30.130,1:37:36.280
new sort of interjection of the actual

1:37:32.820,1:37:38.800
visual material in the same location

1:37:36.280,1:37:41.020
with the text and it's made it like a

1:37:38.800,1:37:43.900
brand new thing for me and just I don't

1:37:41.020,1:37:46.800
know I feel like oh good now I can get

1:37:43.900,1:37:50.590
through to my 80s okay and

1:37:46.800,1:37:51.730
being barred you didn't okay so what

1:37:50.590,1:37:53.110
kind of too far questions if you didn't

1:37:51.730,1:37:54.489
have that facility with the computer

1:37:53.110,1:37:57.580
that you have and that you developed

1:37:54.489,1:37:59.620
from working with pagemaker and or if

1:37:57.580,1:38:00.880
you just have not worked with in the

1:37:59.620,1:38:03.100
computer do you think you would have

1:38:00.880,1:38:05.770
turned to visual art in a physical

1:38:03.100,1:38:08.260
format but it's okay no it would have

1:38:05.770,1:38:11.260
been too much to learn I think I mean it

1:38:08.260,1:38:13.960
still feels like a lot to learn I mean I

1:38:11.260,1:38:18.070
take classes every week I'm taking

1:38:13.960,1:38:20.800
online classes I mean I still can't get

1:38:18.070,1:38:24.750
how to do text on a path what's wrong

1:38:20.800,1:38:29.770
with me I can't make my paths good okay

1:38:24.750,1:38:34.060
yeah I'm not but anyway so I take these

1:38:29.770,1:38:36.250
little online classes to photoshop can

1:38:34.060,1:38:37.780
take any you I mean your husband's an

1:38:36.250,1:38:40.450
artist you have any sort of art

1:38:37.780,1:38:43.180
instruction as well yeah oh yeah okay

1:38:40.450,1:38:45.310
yeah for me and from him yeah and I've

1:38:43.180,1:38:49.780
been taking this like regular college

1:38:45.310,1:38:52.360
classes two-for-one I've caught a buck

1:38:49.780,1:38:54.400
now for a semester when they asked me to

1:38:52.360,1:38:56.890
come out there I said well yes I'll come

1:38:54.400,1:38:59.650
but Stevens will be alright if I sat in

1:38:56.890,1:39:01.060
on an art class while I'm there I wanted

1:38:59.650,1:39:04.630
to take some kind of photography class

1:39:01.060,1:39:07.210
oh but they weren't offering anything so

1:39:04.630,1:39:09.550
I took a film editing class instead but

1:39:07.210,1:39:12.520
anyway I just I felt like I just needed

1:39:09.550,1:39:13.600
to be in that environment with visual

1:39:12.520,1:39:15.940
artists where they're talking about

1:39:13.600,1:39:19.420
competitions yeah because that's I'm

1:39:15.940,1:39:22.239
starting at the tap beginning place yeah

1:39:19.420,1:39:25.600
this composition and design great great

1:39:22.239,1:39:29.290
no I think my husband comes in I invite

1:39:25.600,1:39:31.930
him to come home early a couple nights a

1:39:29.290,1:39:35.980
month and I fly in with some wine and he

1:39:31.930,1:39:38.500
steps here and I show them the pieces

1:39:35.980,1:39:41.560
that I'm working on the some of these

1:39:38.500,1:39:43.900
photos or whatever and I'll fit and I'll

1:39:41.560,1:39:46.050
say it can I just just if you don't like

1:39:43.900,1:39:51.700

1:39:46.050,1:39:55.600
so this is what I'll do a go next but

1:39:51.700,1:39:57.550
then when he likes a piece will explain

1:39:55.600,1:39:59.390
to me what he thinks is working and it's

1:39:57.550,1:40:02.060
all about composition and design

1:39:59.390,1:40:08.060
and that plane is America for you that's

1:40:02.060,1:40:11.690
what I need to learn - I think that's

1:40:08.060,1:40:13.790
good oh okay got quite a bit thank you

1:40:11.690,1:40:16.760

no no I think it's good it's going to be

1:40:20.470,1:40:45.970
hard now you're going to have to edit

1:40:22.760,1:40:45.970
all this huh okay
