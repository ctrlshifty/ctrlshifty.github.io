Composition and Devices: Digital and Analog,0:00:00,"Most fundamentally, of course, is the computer. I have one laptop.  That's my private computer, which sometimes I compose on. Always I compose prose on the computer. I can't imagine being a prose writer and writing in long hand, but some people do.  Beyond that, I have pencils and pens and note books.",0
Saving Pre-writing Notes and Drafts,0:02:53,"I print-off a lot of things. There's a pile of drafts back here that in fact need to be moved to a box, but I haven't brought the new box up from the house. Usually, a box will take two years to fill and then it goes into storage in the basement until somebody offers me enough money for it. And then they can have all the boxes.",173
Archiving Published and In-Progress Work,0:05:00,"I have this, which is sort of the in-process folder&#8212;a little 'thesis binder,' they're called at Harvard. In the back go all the poems that have been published with the name of the magazine on it and in front are the ones that are still in progress.",300
Writing Career and Education,0:07:53,"I'm a product of the creative writing industry. I wanted to be a writer. I wanted to write novels. I wanted to write novels that sold a lot of copies, made me a lot of money. I wanted to live in the South of France...But then I got waylaid by poetry...",473
Composition: Generating Ideas and Analog 'Noodling',0:16:58,"I hate using the word 'idea', though, talking about poems, because people always ask things like...'Where do you get your ideas for poems?' I always want to say, 'What ideas? Where?' Because they tend not to come from ideas, they tend to come from words or phrases or images, or something I've seen outside the window.",1018
Composition: Digital,0:23:23,"Looking at it on the screen gives it the appearance more of a kind of permanence, which is dangerous, I think. It would have been dangerous for me in the beginning, I think, to compose on a word processor or a typewriter because it might have given me this inclination toward a particular kind of structure that in fact would not have been as interesting or as evocative to me.",1403
Learning to Revise Digitally,0:28:32,"Somewhere along the line, I began to prefer the process to the product because that's the place where all the excitement happens. That's the place where you surprise yourself. The process of revision is certainly made so much more fluid and swift with the computer than it ever could have been with writing longhand...",1712
Daily Routine,0:33:07,"It's a luxury to have time. It's an even greater luxury to be on sabbatical, or&#8212;as I envision it when I retire&#8212;permanent sabbatical. We'll see about that. We'll see how that works.",1987
Modes of Revision,0:33:55,"Oh, I'm subtractive. Absolutely. If she weren't so old and weren't taking care of my father 24/7, I would have my mother&#8212;who always embroidered&#8212;embroider me a little sample that I can hang on the wall that says, 'Cutting is virtue,'' because it is. And I think I may be part of the lineage of poets who sometimes can't shut-up.",2035
Collaborative Revision,0:40:55,"Kim is my principal reader and she knows me so well that she can tell when she needs to be supportive and can tell when she needs to be mean. Sometimes you just need to have a kick in the pants.",2455
Revising Individual Poems and Books of Poems,0:45:40,"The assemblage of the whole, and the sections they're in, becomes, also, part of the revision of the individual poems as I find ways to stitch those things together into the larger fabric.",2740
Organizing and Assembling Collections,0:52:22,"I prefer the old and seemingly laborious manual method with seriously analog notation and keeping track of things. I mean, there's no doubt that for me, it has got to be a combination of the two. Even still, I've got pencils all over the place because that's what I need to write in these things with.",3142
File-naming and Digital Organization,1:00:09,"I've got, like, just a poem called 'Ant,' and I've got 'Ant 1,' 'Ant 2,' 'Ant 3,' because I'm not sure which of those drafts I prefer. I kind of like something about them all.",3609
The Writing Life and the Writing Career,1:03:06,"I cannot pay attention to so much of the sort of the professional part of it. Where I tell my students, 'Your writing is your life. Your publishing is your career. You live your life, you manage your career.'",3786
Deadlines and Writer's Block,1:09:23,"I mean, that's facetious, of course, but Bill Stafford always used to say, 'If you can't write, lower your standards.' That's actually tremendously good advice, too, because you lower your standards, and it can open up in so many different ways.",4163
Using the Personal Computer: Advantages and Disadvantages,1:10:20,"I don't see any disadvantages really.  I have sort of worries about what it might do but at this point I can't quite bring myself to go back, mainly because I'm having, it seems like I'm having good luck, and part of that may just be that I've got to that point in my life in my career as a writer where I know a lot of tricks.  I know how to trick myself.",4220
Composition and the Internet,1:18:09,"When I built the thing in 2002 I put an Ethernet cable, buried an Ethernet cable out. I am wired out here but I try to not stay connected very often because it's such an easy distraction.",4689
On Computers and Being 'Finished',1:20:20,"I think that it's just the same as with type print. I don't consider anything complete until I print it off and then send it off into the world.",4820
File Security,1:22:14,"If a forest fire rips-through when I'm gone and burns up the computer and all my boxes of poems and everything, then its Mozy or the cloud, and that's it. And every place in the woods in this part of Idaho burns. It's not if&#8212;it's when.",4934
Correspondence in the Digital Age,1:25:50,"It made letter writing almost go away. And I wrote a lot of letters. Letters were kind of the way I warmed up when I would get into my writing space here.",5150
Teaching in the Digital Age and Digital Natives,1:34:59,"I'll come home and I'll immediately think of like 37 different things I should have said or ways to connect things that they said and sort of bind to our conversation together. And the email&#8212;I'll just do a class email and just, with bullets, say 'Here's this and this and this.' I can add two or three links&#8212;the things they need to consider.",5699
Getting Warmed-up to Write,1:39:05,"I'll sit down and I'll spend the first two hours just kind of messing around with a sonnet...it's like, with a sonnet, I don't need an idea. I just start putting words on paper.",5945
