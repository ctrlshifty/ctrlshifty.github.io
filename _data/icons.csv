armantrout,Rae Armantrout,cloud,170,"I have Dropbox, but I am not using it for this. I'm using it for a class that I've been teaching with someone."
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,email,655,"I still don't do that. But I think email has pretty much ended that for most people. Now, people just shoot off emails and so I don't know what's happening to archives."
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,email,659,"I have saved emails, and even printed them out and given them to libraries, but I just—I think Ron saves everything. So, everything I send to him gets saved. That's how I look at it. He's my archivist. I mean, I only—you know, there's only so much space in my house."
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,email,691,"I don't remember my first email. I remember that Ron said that I had ""ramped up quickly."" That was flattering, so I remember it. "
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,email,700,"Which is really stupid because it's ""RAEA100900."" I shouldn't say that anything my son said was stupid, but he was only about fourteen and I guess he thought that was—I feel like I'm James Bond or something with that email address, but whatever."
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,email,935,You can constantly email your students and remind them of what they're supposed to be doing. I think its just made things easier for everyone.
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,groupfeedback,445,"I used to send them to more people. Lyn Hejinian, at first, and Bob Perelman, at first, and Lydia Davis, the fiction writer—she's a friend of mine. And later, Fanny Howe, too. Now, I mostly just send them to Ron, and once in a while, to Lydia. Very rarely to Lyn Hejinian, but still once in a while, like maybe twice a year. So, kind of that number of people has sort of shrunk."
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,tablet,41,I have an iPad and I have a Dell computer upstairs.
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,tablet,56,"Well, actually, I probably work primarily in this old school device called ""notebook"" where I, you know, fill pages with illegible text, and then once I start to think that my text is coming together, very often I'll do a version of it—just type it into the iPad"
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,tablet,500,"I got an iPhone maybe three years ago, and I got the iPad maybe two years ago. I don't know. Time's a blur."
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,notebook,56,"Well, actually, I probably work primarily in this old school device called ""notebook"" where I, you know, fill pages with illegible text, and then once I start to think that my text is coming together, very often I'll do a version of it—just type it into the iPad. "
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,notebook,346,"Well, I think, I always used a notebook. You know, I couldn't tell you exactly what the notebooks looked like way back then, but I always wrote by hand. I think I wrote by hand then—I'm sure I did longer, took me longer to write a poem, and it also stayed in the hand-written phase longer because back then, when you left the hand-written phase, you had to go to a typewriter."
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,notebook,377,"I don't know if I would cross out [during revision]. I think I would just, you know, go to another page and rewrite."
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,notebook,741,I'd probably have to have a few lines[in the notebook] before I thought it was worth reading them out loud. 
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,notebook,802,"Once I move to this [iPad], then I seldom go back to the notebook."
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,notebook,411,"I still, like I say, work in notebooks but I am sure that I started going from the notebook to the computer sooner than I would have on a typewriter, I am sure. But I don't have a clear memory of it. "
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,personalcpu,395,I probably got the computer by the late-80's
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,printer,131,"I mostly save over, which is not a good idea. But sometimes I have printed out drafts, and I save drafts."
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,printer,664,"What I do now is, if there's anything that seems especially interesting or valuable, I'll print it out and keep it."
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,printer,659,"I have saved emails, and even printed them out and given them to libraries"
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,printer,981,"If I'm judging a contest or something, which I sometimes do, I ask for hard copies. Or if I get them on the screen, I print them because I just don't like to read on the screen. I mean, I don't want to sit up there on a hard chair. I don't want to look at that light"
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,reading aloud,741,"I probably—well, in between—not the first line, but I'd probably have to have a few lines before I thought it was worth reading them out loud"
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,thesisbinder,204,These are called thesis binders. This one is all beaten up. But you can't really even buy them. You used to be able to buy them in stationary stores.
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,thesisbinder,212,"So, this is really old school. But the way I use it is, it helps me order—not only keep the poems for the manuscript, but I order the manuscript this way. I mean, I kind of decide what reads well by trying the poems out in different places within this manuscript so that I don't do that thing you hear about writers doing about spreading the pages all over the floor, or all over the walls, or something. Because I've already been deciding as I went along by where I place them in this thesis binder."
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,typewriter,346,"You're too young to know about typewriters, but they were enormously irritating because if you made any mistakes, you had to either start over or put whiteout on it, or you know, etcetera. And then, you would make a copy. I mean, you would print it out and if you wanted another copy, you'd have to type it again."
armantrout,Rae Armantrout,usb,664,"I know you can save things on your hard drive and give your hard drive to a library, but God knows what's on my hard drive"
beasley,Bruce Beasley,boxes,106,"I have a lot. I have a box of them this big, in no particular order. The other thing I do—you might be interested in—is once a year I print out all the notes, all the computer writing I've done. I keep them in a bound journal that is by year. So this one, for example, is 1999—and you'll see that a lot of times, when I work on the computer, I'll write a kind of journal, just sort of what's going on and what I'm thinking about, and working with stray pieces of poems that I've written down by hand."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,boxes,501,"I would just keep them in a box, I think, until the end of the year, and then bind them up into a notebook."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,email,46,"Things that I put in my office computer, I have to email to myself if I want to work on them here."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,email,666,[My writing colleagues] email the manuscript and they send me back notes and all.
beasley,Bruce Beasley,filecabinet,674,"I have over here in my file cabinet a file called ""Poems: Feedback from Readers,"" where I keep all the physical copies of all the poems that have come back from the people I've shown them to, which I use a lot in revising."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,groupfeedback,647,"We read all of each other's work. We tend to read each other's work when we reach the point we call, ""exhausting our resources, which means that you've revised enough that there is nothing in the draft that makes you—that you know you could improve. You've reached the point where you've done everything you can to it, and it's time to get somebody else's feedback. Suzanne will read my work, and she's a really great reader, and give me really honest feedback on what's working well and what needs work. And then I have, I don't know, four or five friends that I tend to share my work with. Usually after Suzanne has read it and I've revised it further, I'll send to them."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,groupfeedback,674,"I have over here in my file cabinet a file called ""Poems: Feedback from Readers,"" where I keep all the physical copies of all the poems that have come back from the people I've shown them to, which I use a lot in revising."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,tablet,,
beasley,Bruce Beasley,laptop,22,"I have a laptop, a Toshiba Satellite laptop computer, and that's mainly it."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,libraryresearch,620,"Yeah. I still spend a lot of time in libraries, but yeah. It [the internet] allows me to do things right here that I used to have to go to a library for."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,notebook,80,Yeah. I carry either note cards or a notebook with me and scribble things down as I'm walking.
beasley,Bruce Beasley,notebook,88,"Often I'll start with a title like that and start mulling it—and scribbling down lines for it in a journal like this one, and then when I get enough lines, either put them on note cards or just sit down with a computer and a notebook and start transcribing and moving around things that I've written in the notebook."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,notebook,106,"I have a lot. I have a box of them this big, in no particular order. The other thing I do—you might be interested in—is once a year I print out all the notes, all the computer writing I've done. I keep them in a bound journal that is by year. So this one, for example, is 1999—and you'll see that a lot of times, when I work on the computer, I'll write a kind of journal, just sort of what's going on and what I'm thinking about, and working with stray pieces of poems that I've written down by hand."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,notebook,299,"Just associatively. ""Clean machine,"" for example, sounds good to me. I would write on a note card or notebook ""clean machine,"" even though that doesn't mean anything to me. What's a ""clean machine'? And walking, I'll start thinking about a ""clean machine,"" just as an example. So, yes: how do you get from that prose to lines?"
beasley,Bruce Beasley,notebook,497,"So, on a typewriter I'll just save the pages and bind them into a notebook."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,personalcpu,30,"My office computer … is a desktop. … Windows 7—or that's Windows 8, now. In the summer, like now, I work almost exclusively here on that computer. When I'm at work, when I'm teaching, I am often working a couple of hours a day during the day, and I work mostly on the office computer when I'm doing that. So, I'm always sending files back and forth"
beasley,Bruce Beasley,printer,309,"I really try, especially when I write long poems—which a lot of my poems are—not to impose any order on it until I've got pages and pages of lines. Then I'll print them out"
beasley,Bruce Beasley,printer,106,"The other thing I do—you might be interested in—is once a year I print out all the notes, all the computer writing I've done. … somehow it's important to me to have it all printed out. Because when I'm writing and in between poems, I'll often skim through the printouts of previous years, looking for pieces of poems I've started but never finished, or just stray lines that didn't go anywhere but now they do."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,printer,,"[The poems were] printed out on these long rolls of printer paper, you know? Those old-style printer rolls?"
beasley,Bruce Beasley,readingaloud,437,"I have a very particular way of reading it where I try to space out the sounds of the letters that are on either side of the omega, so that that central absence is there, and it's formed by sounds rather than a visual shape on the page."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,typewriter,90,"I can't remember the last time, and I may never have done it—written an entire poem by hand without a typewriter or a computer. I just don't work that way."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,typewriter,93,"I generate fragments of the poem, but the act of consolidating and moving them, and making a poem out of them—for me it's always been done on a computer, or a typewriter before that."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,typewriter,185,"But I had a lot of spare time, so I would write a lot at work on my typewriter—this was before computers."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,typewriter,408," I'm very interested in some of the visual poets, poets like Ronald Johnson. His early work which is all typewriter-based, but he does some amazing things with the shape of the words and the appearance of the words using the typewriter."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,typewriter,687,"[The internet] hasn't really changed my composition process a whole lot, because I was doing on typewriters what I'm now doing on computers. It's made it easier to cut and paste, and to move things around."
beasley,Bruce Beasley,walking,54,I write a lot when I'm walking. I take long walks and scribble in a notebook like this one. Just usually individual lines … taking long walks and just scribbling down random lines. I can write individual lines by hand.
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,cloud,1586,"The book is the thing, and then in the floating galaxy of Carbonite, there's also a copy of it and that's sort of enough."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,email,1760,"I mean, I had a postal scale. I, you know... Everything was like weighing stuff, going to the post office, and stamps, and, you know, printing—you know, which was fine. But now, I mean, email is a dream."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,email,1776,"Email is, I think, great for writer correspondence, for sending people...I mean, going back and forth with revisions—all that."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,email,1800,"Yeah, email has many of the same characteristics but is different from a written letter and... Letter written on a manual typewriter is different from, you know, Charles Dickens dipping his pen, if that's indeed what he did, you know."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,email,1808,"Some emails I print out, and many I save by leaving them on the computer."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,groupfeedback,1776,"But, no, email's, I think, great for writer correspondence, for sending people.. I mean, going back and forth with revisions—all that."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,tablet,130,"I have an iPad mini--which I don't write on that much, but I write on a little and it's like an iPad but it's a little smaller. It's like kind of purse-size."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,tablet,1848,"I have taken in to bringing an iPad to class because... Like we were looking at a, I think it was a Frank O'hara poem and it brought up Betty Grable. None of the undergraduates in class, understandably, who Betty Grable was."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,tablet,1938,"I bring my iPad to class even partly to be like, ""OK, I'm a bunch older than you but don't write me off. I'm actually..."" Yeah, exactly. So, ""Don't kick me out of the world quite yet."""
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,laptop,122,"This laptop is my home computer.And then I have two sort of travel ones. One is a MacBook Air, which is like this but much lighter and thinner."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,libraryresearch,452,"It just saves time. I don't... You know, I don't have to trudge around to all the local libraries looking to see if they have any books on Marie Curie, or if they have a particular title by so-and-so. I can see... I can see if it's in the library. I can find out what the library hours are. I can talk to a librarian if I need to."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,libraryresearch,452,"Even with libraries now, if I'm looking for something specific, I can look online."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,libraryresearch,458,"This is another thing that relates to sort of digital stuff. At least in my mind, the old... One of the only things I miss about pre-digital is card catalogs because they... Thumbing through a card catalog, I would be taken on many more weird tributaries than I get doing a computer search in a library on whatever."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,libraryresearch,478,"I go to the library less because there's so many things I can access online and I can print them out at home, or parts of them. I can, depending on what their security and parameters are like, I can sometimes lift a phrase I want to use out of a website and put it right in to the poem--"
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,notebook,712,"I started writing poems when I was a kid before I had access to a typewriter or—learn to type. It was, you know, spiral-bound, lined notebooks."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,notebook,738,I think I would write in notebooks and then at a certain point transfer what I had to the typewriter.
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,notebook,180,"I think actual writing is almost all on computers now, but note-taking—is probably 75% notebook and pen, and 25% take notes on the computer."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,personalcpu,684,"I remember when, you know, I first got a computer. It was sort of like, you know, I was ZZ Top. I had a tall music system in here. It was a big, bulky thing and there were things that went under the desk."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,printer,696,The print was really ugly looking… Dot matrix… It had these weird strips with holes that you tore…
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,typewriter,631,"I'm 57, so when I started writing it was typewriters, you know? I took a type a typewriter to college and it moved from... You know, I took typing in high school and it was, it went kind of quickly during the time—my little time capsule of when I was sort of coming up from portable typewriters and little cute cases that were sort of like a big lunch box with the little handle to increasingly kind of complicated electric typewriters to...with all their weird accoutrements like carbon paper and white out or weird... Then they started making typewriters that actually had a correcting tape in them. It was like white and you would type over the letter that you wanted to correct, with this white, chalky strip that was in there as part of the typewriter."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,typewriter,738,"I think I would write in notebooks and then at a certain point transfer what I had to the typewriter. Because the typewriter was something... It isn't actually easy to revise on a manual typewriter. I mean, you have to roll the thing out and mark it up. There really isn't an efficient way of marking things out, or putting, inserting a list of possible words you might want to use instead of the word choice that you had. So, I think I would work on it up to a certain point and typing it was sort of like, ""Oh, this is kind of an official draft."
gerstler,Amy Gerstler,usb,1556,"The way I used to back-up was just on external [hard drive]. ... But I have problems with those and also with the house burning down, that would burn down, too."
gluck,Louise Glück,email,149,I have access to an iPad—but I have never written anything on it except a terse email. 
gluck,Louise Glück,email,193,"And then Robert Pinsky—I told him I had an email and he sent me a photo of one of his grandchildren. I opened this little thing and there was a photo. I thought, ""Wow."" So I learned certain skills. I still can't add an attachment. No, that's not what they are called. An app."
gluck,Louise Glück,tablet,149, have access to an iPad—but I have never written anything on it except a terse email. And I cannot bear reading poems in that form.
gluck,Louise Glück,tablet,157,"But I have this [iPad] that gives me fantastic pleasure in other ways. I love it and it's an endless amusement. I keep it very near my bed, or on my bed. If I wake in the middle of the night, I turn on the light and I see if anybody is writing to me."
gluck,Louise Glück,notebook,518,"It just looks like a lot of typed poems with no author's hand apparent. I started keeping a journal when I had whiplash, because someone said, ""You should start writing about what it feels like, because you'll discover that you're not in as much pain as you think you are."" Ha-ha. I mean, I certainly was. But I started this notebook detailing my whiplash symptoms and the agony that they entailed. I always did it in bed at night, reviewing my day, and it became the most crucial piece of my day. That, and listening to the telephone weather forecast, which became Village Life."
gluck,Louise Glück,notebook,520," I did the poems in the back of the book moving toward the middle, and my pain journal from the front, and then I'd start a new notebook. "
gluck,Louise Glück,personalcpu,738,"I'm epileptic and I learned, but I didn't like looking at the screen. The early computers, it was said, were not good for epileptics"
gluck,Louise Glück,printer,151,"when I was in Stanford and friends would send me drafts of poems as we do—as I do through the mail, or at Stanford, I would give something to a secretary—but I just have to go to someone who can print it out."
gluck,Louise Glück,reading aloud,700,"I keep trying to make this point in poetry readings. I hear with my eyes. I mean, the experience of reading a poem—for me, with my eyes—contains an oral experience. And when I hear it, I feel angry. I feel that there's an obstacle between me and the it of the poem. And the obstacle is the reader, who is determining and deploying emphasis. Also, the form, which is turning a kind of web-like experience into a narrative—everything goes by once. And the argument made is, ""Yes, but then you can't hear it."" But I don't hear it when it's read to me, and I don't moderate to myself. I hear it in my head, though, and I hum it in my head."
gluck,Louise Glück,typewriter,522,"One fact of working on the typewriter that's either—I don't know whether it's an advantage or not, and I imagine for prose it would be. My prose writer friends all love the computer, but when I get to an impasse or an awkward line, I have to start over. So it's a new sheet of paper, and you have to do the whole thing again, and problems emerge in those retypings, like your fingers will hesitate over something you thought was resolved, and you realize it's not resolved. You realize you have to do something different."
gluck,Louise Glück,typewriter,768,"I think, it was a big moment when I switched from longhand to the typewriter. Maybe it would be equally transforming to switch to a computer."
mcmichael,James McMichael,boxes,365,"Yes, all the way back, and I think the reading and the note-taking part of it has gotten to be more dominant over the course of the time. These notebooks...[points to bookshelves full of notebooks] And there are probably about 10 others and the ones that fit in that shelf right there—that's about 4 years of worth. Prior to those, I was working with 5x8 cards, writing in long-hand. That just got too hard to keep track of (I had boxes of them and arranged alphabetically), but this is an improvement on that. It's more... It's something I could find and I'd index these so I could find my way around these books. In a way, the cards—they just got too many of them."
mcmichael,James McMichael,email,523,"Then another aspect of it is letters that I write here. So, I'm doing whatever revision I do of the emails I send right here on this. In that way, this makes it a little more personal."
mcmichael,James McMichael,notebook,37," I'll go in to these notebooks and take stuff from them. And then in that form, develop some of what's there—add to it. So, that's part of the process, too."
mcmichael,James McMichael,notebook,67,"So, the notebooks are numbered. So, it'll be from Notebook 23, or something like that."
mcmichael,James McMichael,notebook,365,"These notebooks...[points to bookshelves full of notebooks] And there are probably about 10 others and the ones that fit in that shelf right there—that's about 4 years of worth. Prior to those, I was working with 5x8 cards, writing in long-hand. That just got too hard to keep track of (I had boxes of them and arranged alphabetically), but this is an improvement on that. It's more... It's something I could find and I'd index these so I could find my way around these books. In a way, the cards—they just got too many of them."
mcmichael,James McMichael,personalcpu,523,"I love how non-invasive this [the computer] is as a medium—not so much in terms of my being protected against being invaded by somebody else, but being able to say something (send somebody something here [on the computer]) and understand that they can open it when they want, and that it's not an imposition on them"
mcmichael,James McMichael,personalcpu,575,I've really liked the way the computer makes it possible to re-lineate poems that I've gotten from students—just to give them a sense of how I hear what they're doing with the lines. It's been a help. It's been a help to me. I haven't seen much evidence that it means anything at all to them.
mcmichael,James McMichael,printer,503,"I'll print out whatever it is of whatever I have working on and I take that printed copy with me. Then, I'll just work long-hand with it, leaving the computer here. Then, I'll be back in 3 weeks, or something like that, and then re-incorporate it into what I've got here in my files"
mcmichael,James McMichael,typewriter,247,"I can't imagine how it was possible to write a book of prose (to write the Ulysses book) long-hand with a typewriter. I mean, I just can't. It would have been so much easier if I'd had some facility with the computer to write that."
mcmichael,James McMichael,usb,87,"On Wednesday, I'm told by our tech, that what's there gets backed up. So, Wednesday about 2:00AM, or something like that, and on Thursday at 2:00AM, some back-up takes place. So, that's all I know about it."
mohammad,K. Silem Mohammad,cloud,92,"I've got a server here on campus. It's a backup server that I save things to. It's very simple. All I'd need to do is drag stuff right now, and I could do it to stop worrying about it. I've also got an external hard drive at home."
mohammad,K. Silem Mohammad,email,168,"At first, I became acquainted with Gary's writing on an email list that we were both on, and just for a joke he wrote some kind of New Year's poem, or something like that, that he called a ""flarf poem."" ""Flarf"" was the invented name for the method. It was basically just writing the stupidest, most shapeless thing you could think of. So it was full of non-sense and obscenities, emphatic noises with no real shape or form other than just, basically, roughly being broken in to lines. He and I and a few other people started doing this just for fun, and we created our own email list..."
mohammad,K. Silem Mohammad,groupfeedback,172,"So, a group of us that were on this list, and so eventually, I think it was Drew Gardner who introduced a method in the middle of this shapeless writing of using Google search results. Just going in to the Google page, doing usually a combination search for like two or three terms that you wouldn't expect to see on the same page together and then using that initial search result page as a base from which to collage excerpts."
mohammad,K. Silem Mohammad,laptop,20,"This laptop, a MacBook. I mean, that's about it, other than whatever scratchpad I might put a note or idea in."
mohammad,K. Silem Mohammad,personalcpu,180,part of the fun of it was using the computer as a kind of canvas
mohammad,K. Silem Mohammad,printer,76,"I mean, I might [print out poems] on occasion with something like an essay because it's easier on the eyes. But the poems are usually shorter, and again because of the specific nature of the composition, in some cases, you'll see I can't revise it really well at all if it's not on a computer"
mohammad,K. Silem Mohammad,reading aloud,272,"[Regarding line breaks] I think sound was probably usually at least tied [with grammar] for the primary motivator, there."
mohammad,K. Silem Mohammad,scrappaper,36,if I'm somewhere and all I have is a piece of scratch paper because I'm in a meeting and I get an idea. But I don't really do that often
mohammad,K. Silem Mohammad,usb,92,"I've got a server here on campus. It's a backup server that I save things to. It's very simple. All I'd need to do is drag stuff right now, and I could do it to stop worrying about it. I've also got an external hard drive at home"
pinsky,Robert Pinsky,cloud,83,"I used to go through the whole rigmarole of syncing between my desktop and my laptop. I went through various generations of the best way to do that and now I'm not quite at the totally-cloud web system, but I realized that with a nice external monitor, external keyboard, external mouse, I can use the MacBook Pro as what we used to call the ICU. Then when I'm tired of using that way, I just have to remember to eject the backup and then unplug all that stuff and then I could get on an airplane with it. I'm not syncing it with anything. It's itself."
pinsky,Robert Pinsky,cloud,93,I have a Dropbox account and I have a 2 TB amazingly small little white brick that backs up automatically.
pinsky,Robert Pinsky,email,325,"My papers are at Stanford. They bought up to a certain year of paper-papers, but a librarian at Stanford said to me, ""I hope you're saving your email. I hope you're saving your electronic emails."" There's a new anxiety there. What in there that I wouldn't want quoted will come out in a journal? "
pinsky,Robert Pinsky,email,413,Different times of my life there have been different friends—always somebody around. Jim Olson. Sometimes I email things to Jim.
pinsky,Robert Pinsky,email,501,"I think email is probably more unconscious. I was joking with you about my friend who says scandalous things in emails, and I repeatedly tell him, ""Look out!"" Things you read in the newspaper where in some business setting or political setting, people get nailed. The email trail. It may be generationally something is changing. I think people say things in email they wouldn't say ""in writing"" because they don't think of it as having as much permanence, and sometimes it surprises them."

pinsky,Robert Pinsky,personalcpu,179,"For a good period, I was one of the few people in the country who was writing everything I was writing to read off a screen on a computer, and everything I was writing to read on paper on paper. The Times asked me to review a book of prose by Philip Larkin. I was having a little trouble getting started with it and I had been writing this very fluid Bubble World of computer. I couldn't get started on the Larkin so I decided I'll experiment. I'll see if I can write the lead on the computer, on the monochrome, because it's so much less real than a pen or the typewriter. ... I wound up writing a draft of the whole fucking review on the Atari."
pinsky,Robert Pinsky,personalcpu,185,"I had a jerky, junkie Dot Matrix printer and what we used to call a PC clone—IBM clone—called a Corona. I think it was made in Italy, oddly enough. That was probably 1981, 1980, or something. It was quite early."

pinsky,Robert Pinsky,printer,247,"Sometimes, but more often I'll get enough lines to want to make a draft. So I'll write them down and I'll look at those and recite to myself the different things I've written down, and then I'll decide to type it into a document that I can print out. And then I'll read that over and maybe get a new idea"

pinsky,Robert Pinsky,typewriter,219,"I remember for awhile I shared an apartment with Alan Cheuse, novelist. He does book reviews for NPR. Alan is a year ahead of me and Alan is a fiction writer. I could remember hearing his typewriter going tick, tick, tick. I was sitting there, maybe with a paper and pen thinking, trying out different phrases in my mind and sort of ending that tick, tick, tick."

pinsky,Robert Pinsky,typewriter,287,"I think poetry took an unproductive turn when people fell in love with the technology of the typewriter. Charles Olsen wrote very solemnly that with the new poet, you can count the spaces. Proportional spacing came along within a decade or two and made nonsense of that. To me, the graphic thing—people talk about lining endings quite a lot. I always feel, ""No, I don't write line endings, I write lines"" and it's the whole line. I guess you could say I'm kind of an extremist and very resistant to the visual idea of the poem. Different technologies give people the illusion that poetry is a form of graphics, and I guess for them it is."

ryan,Michael Ryan,email,432,"We went to France in 1997 and there was no internet. So, that's what-17 years ago? We had no email. I think internet was just kind of beginning, here. I remember a friend of mine, whose wife is a novelist, saying that his wife had sent her novel to her agent over ""the wire."" That was about that time, and I thought, ""My God! That's amazing!"" But, yeah-I don't really remember when it came into such a degree that it became something resembling what it is today. It seems like it was a very gradual process."
ryan,Michael Ryan,email,438,"As I recall, there was email very shortly after we came back from France in 1997. So, those last three years of the century, email kind of just started to become the mode of communication. And yes-I was working with a copy editor who lived in San Diego, and we would send things back and forth and to the publisher, which was in Georgia. Yeah, it was all in place by then."
ryan,Michael Ryan,email,466,"A lot of emails have no addressee, and no ""complimentary close,"" as we called it in 4th grade-""Sincerely, Michael.""

ryan,Michael Ryan,email,470,"When I'm responding to somebody's manuscript, I would say there is no change.

And why get up? So it has that quality of really drawing you into being in a relationship with it."

I think what you want in a reader is somebody who loves your work-and maybe loves you-but will tell you the truth about a piece. Even to the point of saying, ""This really doesn't work at all, and belongs in the bone pile,"" but who will tell you, at every place, what doesn't work for them. And you can get a group of these responses, and you can see which ones are useful. I've changed things because of those responses, but I also have not changed things."

ryan,Michael Ryan,personalcpu,206,"For some reason, I can write prose on the computer-and prefer to write it on the computer-because I will change a lot as I am writing. But why that would be specific and, you know, so distinct from one to the other, is a mystery to me. Maybe just because that I originally wrote prose by hand, too. I only stopped writing it by hand, I think, about 20 years ago"

And then when I have to store them, I will shove them together, you know, in a way that they can be folded-in inside, and the latest one will be on top"

strickland,Stephanie Strickland,notebook,75,"Like the last really big new book I did, Dragon Logic, the way I wrote that was, for probably six months, every morning, I had some paper notebooks and things. I was looking through old notes and things. And I would sit and I would write, every morning, for maybe three or four hours and at the end of the morning, I would go and type it up—I mean input it."
strickland,Stephanie Strickland,notebook,96,"It was a bigger notebook than that, probably, a pen with wet ink—wettish ink, not like ballpoint—that has a flow to it, but again because of my hands, to have the least effort of writing. I like a big, like, engineering notebook with graph paper. Often, I had bigger ones like this. It was like a green graph on it. Yeah, I don't like just lined pages. "
strickland,Stephanie Strickland,notebook,108,And the other thing I do that's crazy is that I have some notebooks and then sometimes I go through the exact same notebook again and write into it so that it's actually a palimpsest of two different things that happen and there's no way that you would know—from the outside.

So, I think from the beginning I printed it out and then from the time I had trouble with my hands—which was in 1995, when I first started using Storyspace in a beta version that erased all your links every eleventh save...that was the flaw.

vanwinckel,Nance Van Winckel,notebook,243,"So yeah, early on - one of the things that's different now- is that early on I would probably just work on ""a"" poem, so I would write. I would have a page in my notebook, and there were lines, and I would move things around on the page, and then I would have another page in the notebook with a different poem. But over the years I've started working on maybe two or three poems almost kind of simultaneously, on the same page, which feels kind of nutty, but what I was experiencing that led me this way was that a lot of times things would be coming to me - images, lines --- that didn't seem to belong to the poem I thought I was working on."

Before these things—this pile of thing—goes in to that box, I go through it poem by poem, or draft by draft. I don't organize them but I look for something—""Oh yeah, I forgot about this.""

wrigley,Robert Wrigley,email,444,"When email came along—there's something about putting a poem as an attachment to send to somebody that seems like more of a violation. If you put it folded in an envelope with a letter, it's a much friendlier, more intimate kind of gesture than email is."

Studies in American and English literature, I think it was. But anyway, 20th Century. And I taught Hart Crane. I taught ""The Bridge"" and they both despised Hart Crane because it's not easy and it's a failed epic, God bless him. But we had a wonderful discussion about what qualifies his failure and ambition and so forth, and I was able to send them the follow up email that tried to bind the class discussion together with all sorts of references and links to other things they could read about Crane.

More often than not, I wasn't capable of finishing it. I'd gotten on to something I didn't quite have the knowhow or the resourcefulness to find a way out of. Now, either I do or I've convinced myself I do. So, I get it back out and go to work on it."
wrigley,Robert Wrigley,personalcpu,146,"the thing I thought was best about that part of the process, when the computer came along, was that it saved time. I could immediately just look at it on the screen, go back to longhand and then add what I had written in longhand onto whatever I had already saved on the computer."
wrigley,Robert Wrigley,personalcpu,162,"It changed everything about the poem, having that poem broken into tercets instead of quatrains. That was so easy to do and so easy to examine, to test, with a computer. Let me just backspace here, space here, return here—I just did that,looked at that: ""Okay. Bingo!"" That sort of thing I think is one of the great things that that part of the technology of the computer helps to facilitate"
wrigley,Robert Wrigley,printer,295,"It maybe that eventually I'll get to a final version of that poem called ""Ant"" and eliminate the others, or I'll print them off, put them in a box, and eliminate them from the hard drive—just get rid of them so they don't clutter up or get in the way"
wrigley,Robert Wrigley,printer,391,I don't consider anything complete until I print it off and then send it off into the world
wrigley,Robert Wrigley,printer,397,"I also print things off relentlessly. Every time I get through a draft, and which is why I fill up so many cartons of paper. North Texas, those people who buy so many piles of writer's papers—especially Western writers—pay by the pound. So, you feel me? You aren't going to pay me anything for my electronic files. No, I'm printing these off. The paper is heavy"
wrigley,Robert Wrigley,printer,412,"[In emails with Billy Collins] they're all these little short snippets, which I find myself compelled to come out and print off—the whole thread of the thing, one email at a time—to snatch a page that long. But I want to save those things. Something about saving them electronically doesn't seem like saving them on paper."
wrigley,Robert Wrigley,thesisbinder,259,"At Montana when I was in graduate school, if you didn't have a spring binder to keep your poems in, you just weren't shit. I mean, it was your spring binder, man. ""I don't have one."" ""Oh..."""
wrigley,Robert Wrigley,thesisbinder,54,"I have this which is sort of the in-process folder—a little ""thesisbinder,"" they're called at Harvard. In the back go all the poems that have been published with the name of the magazine on it and in front are the ones that are still in progress."
wrigley,Robert Wrigley,typewriter,138,"I had an IBM Selectric. I guess even before that, I had some other kind of electric typewriter. I would type it up as far as I could go and then wait and see what would happen. Usually what that meant was that I'd take the poem out of the typewriter, as far as it went, and write it back down long hand in the note book but it would look different. It shaped it differently"
wrigley,Robert Wrigley,typewriter,138,"It would have been dangerous for me in the beginning,I think, to compose on a word processor or a typewriter because it might have given me this inclination toward a particular kind of structure that in fact would not have been as interesting or as evocative to me."
wrigley,Robert Wrigley,typewriter,158,"My first book manuscript that Penguin published, that was all typed on a typewriter without page numbers, which are then penciled in. I thought about winding it all in the typewriter, typing-in page numbers, but I thought, ""This is insane, it'll drive me nuts."
wrigley,Robert Wrigley,usb,401,"I'm less concerned with the Mac. Somehow it seems, you know, I never have any issues with it. Whereas PC sometimes seem to kind of odd or they would be afflicted by some bug. That worried me so I had this 3/4 TB hard drive that, every time I came out here, I just plugged it in and it was on automatic backup"
wrigley,Robert Wrigley,usb,311,"Once I decide that that's done and it goes into computer as a kind of final draft, that's just the final poem as it stands there and I'll eliminate anything else that existed along the way, just to keep the old hard drive from being cluttered up, and just to make it easier to find things when I need them."
wrigley,Robert Wrigley,usb,23,"I no longer have an external hard drive. Back when I had a PC I had an external hard drive where I backed up everything from the hard drive of the computer onto an external drive. Now, I put things into the cloud"
