0:00:40.239,0:00:46.17,digital media so those are meant to be

0:00:49.870,0:00:57.90,we'll kind of talk more about the arc of

0:00:52.359,0:00:59.19,your career and different ways to leave

0:00:57.909,0:01:03.37,your progress has changed or not changed

0:00:59.199,0:01:08.65,in accordance with history yeah

0:01:23.200,0:01:28.63,is kind of how you work currently on

0:01:25.270,0:01:35.01,which honesty working as a writer write

0:01:28.630,0:01:38.20,prose and poetry essays love fiction and

0:01:35.010,0:01:43.96,mostly poems so you find are you guys

0:01:38.200,0:01:46.00,okay yeah and I know the perfect zone

0:01:43.960,0:01:47.59,this will be repetitive and I don't you

0:01:46.000,0:01:49.33,know the if it's like you're like okay I

0:01:47.590,0:01:52.15,did it fine

0:01:49.330,0:01:54.19,okay um what kind of devices do you own

0:01:52.150,0:01:57.18,or have access to free writing in terms

0:01:54.190,0:02:03.85,of computers devices yeah I have a

0:01:57.180,0:02:07.57,desktop computer and iPad I don't use

0:02:03.850,0:02:13.93,the iPad much but sometimes for internet

0:02:07.570,0:02:15.43,stuff so do you have that you have you

0:02:13.930,0:02:16.93,have a desktop computer here you have

0:02:15.430,0:02:18.90,one also at your

0:02:16.930,0:02:20.34,that you work all yours with you don't

0:02:18.909,0:02:23.59,miss something so that's your main

0:02:20.349,0:02:26.87,computer froze its Saturday lunch and

0:02:23.590,0:02:30.40,what operating system are you using a

0:02:26.879,0:02:34.56,Microsoft Word so we need a PC or Mac

0:02:30.400,0:02:35.90,it's pretty shitty and so you answer

0:02:34.569,0:02:38.70,that question

0:02:35.909,0:02:40.65,these computers exclusively for your

0:02:38.709,0:02:43.81,work or do you use both physical and

0:02:40.659,0:02:45.70,digital environments a lot of time and

0:02:43.810,0:02:47.76,do you mean you work on paper in

0:02:45.700,0:02:49.03,digitally you go back and forth or are

0:02:47.769,0:02:51.57,you at the point where you work

0:02:49.030,0:02:55.87,primarily on the computer work I dressed

0:02:51.579,0:02:59.56,a problems my hand and then I'll go back

0:02:55.870,0:03:04.91,to the computer and go sometimes back

0:02:59.560,0:03:04.91,and forth pros I write on the computer

0:03:10.859,0:03:17.34,and then it are their point during well

0:03:15.159,0:03:20.20,a Father's Day

0:03:17.340,0:03:21.97,at which point do you kind of like if

0:03:20.200,0:03:25.70,you're writing by hand like when you

0:03:21.970,0:03:30.19,move to the computer yeah it depends I

0:03:25.709,0:03:35.37,just it seems to be finished enough to

0:03:30.190,0:03:36.87,make a type 2 copy do you save you do

0:03:35.379,0:03:41.13,you have any pre writing your notes to

0:03:36.879,0:03:43.38,be finger it easily yeah again it

0:03:41.139,0:03:46.98,depends on the piece they're all very

0:03:43.389,0:03:49.87,different but sometimes they there's a

0:03:46.989,0:03:53.76,lot of notes sometimes there's not much

0:03:49.870,0:03:57.87,I don't usually take notes on the

0:03:53.769,0:04:03.63,computer I usually will do that by hand

0:03:57.870,0:04:05.62,and do you save those rewriting this is

0:04:03.639,0:04:09.04,the physical copy you keep in somewhere

0:04:05.620,0:04:11.56,I keep everything yeah and my papers are

0:04:09.040,0:04:14.10,at the University of Virginia so

0:04:11.560,0:04:20.31,theoretically someday I should be

0:04:14.109,0:04:20.31,sending what's accumulated yeah to them

0:04:21.000,0:04:25.82,how do you save your digital files like

0:04:24.669,0:04:32.28,you

0:04:25.820,0:04:37.52,pond5 I try to do them in terms of the

0:04:32.280,0:04:40.50,draft numbers like I will save the title

0:04:37.520,0:04:44.52,sometimes I'll put the date if it seems

0:04:40.500,0:04:47.13,germane but I will put numbers so that

0:04:44.520,0:04:51.30,the first draft that goes on the

0:04:47.130,0:04:53.91,computer is one and so forth yeah and

0:04:51.300,0:04:55.77,then you save them all in one well how

0:04:53.910,0:04:57.45,does it what the folder system like are

0:04:55.770,0:05:02.16,you saving them and just like poetry

0:04:57.450,0:05:07.98,folder yeah no this one currently is

0:05:02.160,0:05:11.97,prompt 2012 - because that was when I

0:05:07.980,0:05:16.17,finished my last book of poems so

0:05:11.970,0:05:18.87,they're kind of arranged by a book and

0:05:16.170,0:05:20.64,then so once you have the poem on a

0:05:18.870,0:05:25.05,computer you ever printed out to advise

0:05:20.640,0:05:29.12,it that way yes yes and you save paper

0:05:25.050,0:05:32.61,copies of those - yeah well usually I

0:05:29.120,0:05:35.76,can get a floppy about it but I try to

0:05:32.610,0:05:40.35,say most you have you do that you put

0:05:35.760,0:05:44.52,any viable pity boxes for years I have

0:05:40.350,0:05:47.31,big my office is filled with stacks of

0:05:44.520,0:05:53.10,brown boxes as you might remember and

0:05:47.310,0:05:56.31,it's all a big mess in a big pile it

0:05:53.100,0:06:01.59,could be several months away we are

0:05:56.310,0:06:04.17,lucky or or perhaps not so lucky

0:06:01.590,0:06:06.75,so look we're there also like brown bags

0:06:04.170,0:06:09.51,- it was just boxes I feel like I

0:06:06.750,0:06:12.51,remembers like paper bags no there were

0:06:09.510,0:06:14.82,no problem but they were sisters because

0:06:12.510,0:06:17.93,my memory screen memories of and then I

0:06:14.820,0:06:20.11,think I'd swap here that I already I am

0:06:17.930,0:06:23.69,make sure you like

0:06:20.110,0:06:28.59,playful of your pinky walking back

0:06:23.699,0:06:31.38,pathetic but not quite as pathetic do

0:06:28.599,0:06:33.09,you do you back up your digital copy you

0:06:31.389,0:06:35.31,have some sort of like you put them on a

0:06:33.099,0:06:39.55,hard drive somewhere Elser you know I

0:06:35.319,0:06:43.00,hope it has a backup of our system on it

0:06:39.550,0:06:46.50,I think it I get backs it up or

0:06:43.000,0:06:48.87,automatically okay see you don't are you

0:06:46.509,0:06:51.06,using something with Dropbox or and even

0:06:48.879,0:06:56.59,though I'm not running the bad things

0:06:51.069,0:06:58.44,wall and so once you're finished with

0:06:56.590,0:07:00.75,the phone how do you save that sort of

0:06:58.449,0:07:03.46,finished pizza is that does that go into

0:07:00.759,0:07:06.12,a manuscript file is that I mean what

0:07:03.460,0:07:08.59,happens once you feel like the poem well

0:07:06.129,0:07:11.88,again it's just know when it's done it's

0:07:08.590,0:07:14.65,just number whatever 15 of that

0:07:11.889,0:07:19.56,particular poem and it just stays in

0:07:14.650,0:07:22.81,that folder until it's time for the book

0:07:19.569,0:07:26.25,and then I will transfer the latest the

0:07:22.810,0:07:29.05,final draft of everything into some

0:07:26.259,0:07:32.61,other place so that you know it's just

0:07:29.050,0:07:38.46,the final drafts and then there's always

0:07:32.610,0:07:54.31,galleys and poo fridge stuff and so that

0:07:38.469,0:07:57.46,yeah that becomes a separate folder with

0:07:54.310,0:08:00.75,larger scope so how long have you been

0:07:57.460,0:08:02.46,writing professionally and by

0:08:00.759,0:08:05.02,professionally I mean in a way that you

0:08:02.469,0:08:06.87,are heard supporting yourself or or that

0:08:05.020,0:08:09.41,it lets jobs or something like that

0:08:06.879,0:08:19.96,the first problem I published was in

0:08:09.419,0:08:22.47,1970 so 44 years which was hitting well

0:08:19.960,0:08:25.08,actually the first published problem

0:08:22.479,0:08:28.18,that was in my first book was 1,
0:08:25.080,0:08:31.32,before that there were a couple that the

0:08:28.180,0:08:34.69,first one in the oldest problem in my

0:08:31.320,0:08:40.33,new unselected is a poem called hitting

0:08:34.690,0:08:41.95,fun God would you please describe some

0:08:40.330,0:08:44.41,of the arc of your career like kind of

0:08:41.950,0:08:46.32,education all the way through rate what

0:08:44.410,0:08:50.26,would you know your current and launches

0:08:46.320,0:08:55.06,um I've been teaching all of the time

0:08:55.060,0:09:00.10,honor education meeting I'm connected

0:08:57.540,0:09:04.51,when I went to Notre Dame

0:09:00.100,0:09:07.29,there weren't any writing workshops so I

0:09:04.510,0:09:11.38,was an English major and I was

0:09:07.290,0:09:14.47,interested in being I was the editor of

0:09:11.380,0:09:19.05,the literary magazine at Notre Dame when

0:09:14.470,0:09:24.37,I was a senior there and I wrote

0:09:19.050,0:09:28.92,extremely bad undergraduate palms I then

0:09:24.370,0:09:33.31,went to a Claremont Graduate School and

0:09:28.920,0:09:37.87,Claremont here and was going to get a

0:09:33.310,0:09:43.12,PhD in English and was writing poems all

0:09:37.870,0:09:48.13,of that time and decided to leave after

0:09:43.120,0:09:50.71,three semesters and dropped out went to

0:09:48.130,0:09:55.68,Cambridge was with some friends of I

0:09:50.710,0:09:55.68,work in a bookstore and Harvard Square

0:09:56.250,0:10:02.70,the funny there's a funny story about

0:10:00.760,0:10:06.46,[Music]

0:10:02.700,0:10:09.67,after I quit at Claremont and what's

0:10:06.460,0:10:12.71,arable land duck there it was during the

0:10:09.670,0:10:18.65,time of the Cambodia invasions

0:10:12.710,0:10:25.07,was a very charged political time I had

0:10:18.650,0:10:28.04,gone through Iowa City and expected that

0:10:25.070,0:10:29.90,since I was a poet all the faculty on

0:10:28.040,0:10:35.75,the workshop would want to read my

0:10:29.900,0:10:41.39,column so kindly Jewish Starbuck met

0:10:35.750,0:10:43.40,with me and I handed in the manuscript

0:10:41.390,0:10:46.34,two palms and he put it in his desk

0:10:43.400,0:10:48.82,drawer and he'd be just stopped for a

0:10:46.340,0:10:55.34,few minutes and that was it and I left

0:10:48.820,0:10:59.66,and after I quit the the ph.d program

0:10:55.340,0:11:02.54,like Clermont I got a letter from George

0:10:59.660,0:11:09.35,so but saying you're accepted to the

0:11:02.540,0:11:11.09,workshop why don't you apply wasn't it

0:11:09.350,0:11:14.39,yeah a miracle

0:11:11.090,0:11:17.84,never could happen now or even come

0:11:14.390,0:11:21.17,close to such a thing but he was a very

0:11:17.840,0:11:25.67,sweet man and apparently saw something

0:11:21.170,0:11:31.42,in my poems and so then I went to Iowa

0:11:25.670,0:11:35.27,from 1970 to 74 my god I must say there

0:11:31.420,0:11:40.78,I couldn't get a job after getting an

0:11:35.270,0:11:43.58,MFA so they kindly offered to put me up

0:11:40.780,0:11:50.63,for another year I worked on the Iowa

0:11:43.580,0:11:52.43,review as a poetry editor and they said

0:11:50.630,0:11:55.22,if you're going to stay you have to go

0:11:52.430,0:11:57.56,back in the ph.d program because we have

0:11:55.220,0:12:05.15,several a give you grant you had eight

0:11:57.560,0:12:07.40,and so I did that and work on the Iowa

0:12:05.150,0:12:10.40,review still couldn't get a job after

0:12:07.400,0:12:13.33,the next year and the fourth year

0:12:10.400,0:12:18.38,between the summer the summer of my

0:12:13.330,0:12:21.20,after my third year I got a call from

0:12:18.380,0:12:24.02,Yale University Press saying I won the

0:12:21.200,0:12:27.20,ALCS our younger poets and so I went

0:12:24.020,0:12:30.08,back to Iowa for fourth year finish up

0:12:27.200,0:12:34.88,my PhD they can put me on the faculty

0:12:30.080,0:12:37.97,for my last semester there and then I

0:12:34.880,0:12:44.17,went to sort of leftist University from

0:12:37.970,0:12:46.97,there for four years I then directed the

0:12:44.170,0:12:50.96,MFA program which is now at Warren

0:12:46.970,0:12:55.61,Wilson while it was a Goddard while the

0:12:50.960,0:12:59.81,director Ellen White had her Guggenheim

0:12:55.610,0:13:02.27,here from the I was there two years I

0:12:59.810,0:13:07.45,guess well one year and then I went to

0:13:02.270,0:13:10.25,Princeton for two years and to

0:13:07.450,0:13:14.02,Charlottesville Virginia Virginia taught

0:13:10.250,0:13:19.52,at University of Virginia as a visitor

0:13:14.029,0:13:23.00,and also mostly at one Wilson for rental

0:13:19.520,0:13:27.14,of all those years and then came here

0:13:23.000,0:13:32.77,and I've been here since 1991 it was she

0:13:27.140,0:13:35.99,California tour was that too long I mean

0:13:32.779,0:13:41.17,oh that's exactly home - I mean just

0:13:35.990,0:13:43.88,going to start this is flattens you and

0:13:41.170,0:13:45.92,so I now I'm going to kind of ask you

0:13:43.880,0:13:49.76,about the more specifically about your

0:13:45.920,0:13:52.07,writing practice and what I couldn't

0:13:49.760,0:13:53.60,delineating into like three stages being

0:13:52.070,0:13:57.10,the first being kind of like

0:13:53.600,0:13:59.81,compositional prewriting generative page

0:13:57.100,0:14:01.79,and the second being kind of revision

0:13:59.810,0:14:03.83,stage and then the third being the core

0:14:01.790,0:14:07.31,kind of organizational archival stage

0:14:03.830,0:14:08.69,which by which I mean like when you when

0:14:07.310,0:14:09.10,things are starting to be finished and

0:14:08.690,0:14:10.45,putting

0:14:09.100,0:14:12.64,books and then what you do with those

0:14:10.450,0:14:15.52,publications and my kind of how you how

0:14:12.640,0:14:21.25,you can you know work with that another

0:14:15.520,0:14:22.99,kind of stuff and so does that make

0:14:21.250,0:14:24.34,sense about your shirt if that matches

0:14:22.990,0:14:27.84,up with your writing proper is enough to

0:14:24.340,0:14:31.15,talk then it suggests Orioles usually

0:14:27.840,0:14:32.41,little just gonna go and I'll know it

0:14:31.150,0:14:36.04,you'll probably use your questions that

0:14:32.410,0:14:37.81,I have later okay whatever

0:14:36.040,0:14:40.45,what I'd like to talk about it kind of

0:14:37.810,0:14:41.83,like what how you were writing initially

0:14:40.450,0:14:44.77,and was in the beginning parts of your

0:14:41.830,0:14:47.29,career and then and then kind of think

0:14:44.770,0:14:48.79,about how that changed and if there were

0:14:47.290,0:14:49.90,sort of significant changes where those

0:14:48.790,0:14:53.35,were stuff like that

0:14:49.900,0:14:55.45,so would you please describe kind of

0:14:53.350,0:14:56.92,your typical compositional practices

0:14:55.450,0:14:59.20,when you first started writing

0:14:56.920,0:15:00.88,especially like at Iowa maybe a little

0:14:59.200,0:15:03.43,past that area

0:15:00.880,0:15:05.26,how were you writing we're using were

0:15:03.430,0:15:07.57,you using in your handwriting and using

0:15:05.260,0:15:09.79,typewriter could you keep it notebooks

0:15:07.570,0:15:12.43,or things like that

0:15:09.790,0:15:14.89,I don't think I kept a notebook in those

0:15:12.430,0:15:19.00,days when I went to Iowa is writing five

0:15:14.890,0:15:26.35,poems a week it was fun and easy hey

0:15:19.000,0:15:30.82,this is easy and occasionally changing a

0:15:26.350,0:15:33.64,word or two and all by hand I mean I

0:15:30.820,0:15:36.58,would have to type it up at some point

0:15:33.640,0:15:41.94,and I that was up on a typewriter and

0:15:36.580,0:15:47.89,those days a manual typewriter I think

0:15:41.940,0:15:51.52,and that changed in my second year there

0:15:47.890,0:15:54.97,I guess I just hit a wall and saw that I

0:15:51.520,0:16:02.07,could not write the poem that I wanted

0:15:54.970,0:16:05.50,hope to write in one draft and I began

0:16:02.070,0:16:11.74,multiple drastic much more frequently

0:16:05.500,0:16:15.18,and almost always so and most of the

0:16:11.740,0:16:19.09,poems and my first book were written

0:16:15.180,0:16:19.92,that way that's not the old way and how

0:16:19.090,0:16:22.54,did that work

0:16:19.920,0:16:25.70,I kind of like just nitty-gritty life

0:16:22.549,0:16:29.24,well again it's always been going back

0:16:25.709,0:16:30.92,and I mean it's mostly handwritten over

0:16:29.249,0:16:33.23,and over and over and over and over

0:16:30.929,0:16:36.35,again starting from the beginning I

0:16:33.239,0:16:39.98,never have been able to do it any other

0:16:36.359,0:16:43.36,way the first word first four syllable

0:16:39.989,0:16:47.75,first all the way to the end and

0:16:43.369,0:16:51.61,sometimes I will have a hold in fact the

0:16:47.759,0:16:55.04,happiest times I will have a whole draft

0:16:51.619,0:16:57.50,to work from and but you know there

0:16:55.049,0:17:02.45,really isn't any way to formalize it

0:16:57.509,0:17:05.15,because everyone's different every

0:17:02.459,0:17:09.41,single piece I've ever written comes

0:17:05.159,0:17:12.32,differently has different problems we

0:17:09.419,0:17:16.26,Maxwell City learn nothing about writing

0:17:12.329,0:17:18.65,the next novel from page plus one and it

0:17:16.260,0:17:21.41,does feel to me like it's sort of like

0:17:18.659,0:17:26.22,I'm inventing the wheel every time out

0:17:21.419,0:17:28.59,and and they just don't resemble each

0:17:26.220,0:17:32.97,other I've written palms and single

0:17:28.590,0:17:37.55,drafts you know not very often but I've

0:17:32.970,0:17:40.50,also written 250 drafts of a palm and

0:17:37.559,0:17:43.62,still not finished it and it ends up in

0:17:40.500,0:17:49.40,the brown box and I had finished poems

0:17:43.620,0:17:52.98,that I studied 25 years earlier because

0:17:49.409,0:17:57.48,for whatever reason my life has changed

0:17:52.980,0:18:00.11,I've changed a little I helped and saw

0:17:57.480,0:18:03.77,the solution to the problem that was

0:18:00.110,0:18:07.86,insoluble really is like doing problems

0:18:03.779,0:18:13.47,I think at that stage of the composition

0:18:07.860,0:18:16.35,at least the idea is kind that you get

0:18:13.470,0:18:20.29,something that compels you to know how

0:18:16.350,0:18:26.61,it is it drives you through to its

0:18:20.299,0:18:28.45,finish and that finish may take a while

0:18:26.610,0:18:32.59,or not you know

0:18:28.450,0:18:35.80,I might take forms that can be snags

0:18:32.590,0:18:39.01,along the way there can be endings that

0:18:35.800,0:18:42.70,don't come but it isn't you know linear

0:18:39.010,0:18:46.99,there's problems that occur structural

0:18:42.700,0:18:50.26,problems and so forth and in terms of

0:18:46.990,0:18:52.51,how this is going kind of physically so

0:18:50.260,0:18:54.31,you say you just you write a draft and

0:18:52.510,0:18:56.74,then you never let go back across that

0:18:54.310,0:18:58.57,out or you just you write another draft

0:18:56.740,0:19:00.39,in another draft and another draft all

0:18:58.570,0:19:04.57,and written I'm just trying to clarify

0:19:00.390,0:19:09.43,uh no I will cross things out or write

0:19:04.570,0:19:12.55,in alternatives on the side yeah I mean

0:19:09.430,0:19:14.77,I don't recopy the whole draft every

0:19:12.550,0:19:18.22,single time which I guess is where they

0:19:14.770,0:19:21.31,indicated before but if it's just you

0:19:18.220,0:19:24.93,know messing with tweaks yeah but

0:19:21.310,0:19:29.35,sometimes you know the snag will get hit

0:19:24.930,0:19:33.01,at line whatever five and then I will

0:19:29.350,0:19:35.40,start over again on line 25 and you know

0:19:33.010,0:19:39.10,so I just have to have the whole thing

0:19:35.400,0:19:45.13,in my head and you know at a certain

0:19:39.100,0:19:48.88,point but rarely before a whole draft is

0:19:45.130,0:19:52.41,there yeah I will go to the computer and

0:19:48.880,0:19:56.04,type it up and then it helps to see it

0:19:52.410,0:19:59.77,printed out I don't work on the screen

0:19:56.040,0:20:03.58,print it up and then work on some more

0:19:59.770,0:20:06.18,by hand and the way to use the computer

0:20:03.580,0:20:10.78,now the same way you decipher

0:20:06.180,0:20:13.54,essentially yeah I mean I guess maybe

0:20:10.780,0:20:16.14,sometimes I do make little changes on

0:20:13.540,0:20:20.01,the screen you know if I'm typing it up

0:20:16.140,0:20:25.11,again or something you know that will

0:20:20.010,0:20:30.15,perhaps provoke a bread problem minor

0:20:25.110,0:20:33.52,changes taking changing in article or oh

0:20:30.150,0:20:35.55,yeah nothing never never interesting

0:20:33.520,0:20:40.45,well usually man I know

0:20:35.559,0:20:43.24,is my recollection of and the

0:20:40.450,0:20:45.37,handwriting the composition pieces are

0:20:43.240,0:20:47.40,the were today's physically are they in

0:20:45.370,0:20:48.54,the notebook are they on freighter

0:20:47.409,0:20:52.04,pieces of paper

0:20:48.549,0:20:56.12,they're on yellow well actually I do

0:20:52.049,0:20:58.69,okay now you're making me feel

0:20:56.129,0:21:04.17,idiosyncratic am i guess everybody

0:20:58.690,0:21:10.26,problem is what I do is I take a piece

0:21:04.179,0:21:13.11,of white typing paper usually it has

0:21:10.269,0:21:18.24,something written on the other side I

0:21:13.110,0:21:22.65,will fold it in half and I will start

0:21:18.249,0:21:25.33,writing on one side of it and I you know

0:21:22.659,0:21:28.99,and if that goes on if it's longer than

0:21:25.330,0:21:32.40,that I will go to the other side but and

0:21:28.990,0:21:35.52,then I just store them you know I will

0:21:32.409,0:21:38.55,shove them together you know the way

0:21:35.529,0:21:42.73,that they can be folded in inside and

0:21:38.559,0:21:46.80,the latest one will be on top but also I

0:21:42.730,0:21:49.17,will also write on yellow pants and

0:21:46.809,0:21:51.66,that'll come into the process and then

0:21:49.179,0:21:54.94,there's the typed sheets

0:21:51.669,0:22:00.46,it all sounds pretty chaotic when I said

0:21:54.940,0:22:01.99,but or really compulsively so but it

0:22:00.460,0:22:04.17,easily that direction to start on a

0:22:01.990,0:22:07.02,packing paper move to the other sheets

0:22:04.179,0:22:10.60,and then computer well it's very

0:22:07.029,0:22:14.67,sometimes there are no yellow sheets but

0:22:10.600,0:22:17.61,it will always go from I will never

0:22:14.679,0:22:21.54,start composing a poem on the typewriter

0:22:17.619,0:22:24.24,on the computer ever that doesn't happen

0:22:21.549,0:22:28.11,it's always playing so it always goes

0:22:24.249,0:22:31.01,that way now in terms of your prose work

0:22:28.119,0:22:34.21,is that start on the computer mm-hmm

0:22:31.019,0:22:37.41,yeah for some reason I can write prose

0:22:34.210,0:22:40.80,on the computer and prefer to write it

0:22:37.419,0:22:44.40,yes on a computer for such because I can

0:22:40.809,0:22:45.84,change I'm you know will change a lot as

0:22:44.409,0:22:50.86,I am right

0:22:45.840,0:22:55.87,but why that would be specifically and

0:22:50.860,0:22:59.86,you know so distinct from wonder the

0:22:55.870,0:23:03.69,other is a mystery to me yeah maybe just

0:22:59.860,0:23:08.08,because but I wrote you know I

0:23:03.690,0:23:10.99,originally wrote prose by hand to

0:23:08.080,0:23:16.42,apparently stopped writing it by hand I

0:23:10.990,0:23:19.00,think about 20 years ago well I think I

0:23:16.420,0:23:23.08,wrote secret life on that computer

0:23:19.000,0:23:28.24,maybe when computers came in that was -

0:23:23.080,0:23:32.53,yeah I think it mostly yeah yeah that

0:23:28.240,0:23:36.45,was in the 80s and these yeah I had one

0:23:32.530,0:23:37.84,of those enormous things with a huge

0:23:36.450,0:23:40.66,processor

0:23:37.840,0:23:42.67,yeah did you know a difference once you

0:23:40.660,0:23:44.56,really were eating the type of area

0:23:42.670,0:23:47.95,money and you move to the computer was

0:23:44.560,0:23:49.51,there what that well what the great

0:23:47.950,0:23:52.57,thing about it was that you can make

0:23:49.510,0:23:57.22,changes yeah you know and you didn't

0:23:52.570,0:24:00.10,have to retype the whole thing which is

0:23:57.220,0:24:03.79,what you what I what you had to do great

0:24:00.100,0:24:06.64,before that and how'd you compose prose

0:24:03.790,0:24:10.51,long as we did you ever guess all melt

0:24:06.640,0:24:14.41,yeah any mostly essay in my book of

0:24:10.510,0:24:17.35,essays which was published in 200,
0:24:14.410,0:24:20.29,uh-huh we're composed long yeah I know

0:24:17.350,0:24:22.81,that is over they written initially

0:24:20.290,0:24:25.24,earlier than I mean I'm assuming quite a

0:24:22.810,0:24:29.62,much early required quite a few of them

0:24:25.240,0:24:34.08,were and maybe the latter let the last

0:24:29.620,0:24:43.81,ones in it were composed on computer ok

0:24:34.080,0:24:45.19,track likely yeah so so that so the

0:24:43.810,0:24:46.77,computer came in and kind of late

0:24:45.190,0:24:50.02,eighties

0:24:46.770,0:24:51.07,did you notice as like computing power

0:24:50.020,0:24:52.69,computer

0:24:51.070,0:24:55.48,you know more more powerful than

0:24:52.690,0:24:58.12,anything change then or headed to the

0:24:55.480,0:25:02.91,field basically the same since it's the

0:24:58.120,0:25:04.54,first time well that first time before

0:25:02.919,0:25:06.48,you were born

0:25:04.540,0:25:12.03,[Laughter]

0:25:06.480,0:25:14.79,yeah but they you know they were so slow

0:25:12.039,0:25:20.44,and well you know but at the time it

0:25:14.799,0:25:25.24,seemed like magic and just being able to

0:25:20.440,0:25:29.55,change it so yeah of course it's changed

0:25:25.240,0:25:33.90,everything is accelerated and you can

0:25:29.559,0:25:37.57,look up stuff and look up definitions of

0:25:33.909,0:25:40.60,words I would always often write with a

0:25:37.570,0:25:44.76,dictionary I never have called the poem

0:25:40.600,0:25:47.95,finished before I looked up most of the

0:25:44.769,0:25:52.50,words in the poem yeah I'd like to see

0:25:47.950,0:25:54.99,how the etymology work in relationship

0:25:52.509,0:25:59.62,to one another before I call something

0:25:54.990,0:26:03.00,finished so now you can do a lot of that

0:25:59.620,0:26:08.40,on the computer you know you have Lube

0:26:03.009,0:26:11.86,for meeting a physical I still have them

0:26:08.409,0:26:14.76,there next to my chair upstairs so

0:26:11.860,0:26:19.75,they're you know I feel like to do that

0:26:14.769,0:26:24.96,but yeah I not a systematic about it I

0:26:19.750,0:26:24.96,will look up things on the computer too

0:26:25.440,0:26:30.25,sewing that in so when you first start

0:26:27.820,0:26:32.08,using a computer were you also that all

0:26:30.250,0:26:34.09,the time we were always printing out we

0:26:32.080,0:26:40.48,never really worked on the screen even

0:26:34.090,0:26:42.22,in those early days at the time yeah so

0:26:40.480,0:26:43.99,and now we're going to do kind of

0:26:42.220,0:26:49.21,supervision section and we're talking

0:26:43.990,0:26:51.42,about both in that song okay so you

0:26:49.210,0:26:54.15,spoke some about your vision factors

0:26:51.429,0:26:56.67,when you first started at being fairly

0:26:54.159,0:26:58.75,small what was the profit that sort of

0:26:56.679,0:27:02.20,the change

0:26:58.750,0:27:09.49,you more robust on revision strategies

0:27:02.200,0:27:15.34,well the poem that I wanted needed could

0:27:09.490,0:27:19.45,see to write couldn't be written in a

0:27:15.340,0:27:22.30,single draft so I just had to keep I

0:27:19.450,0:27:25.57,guess I got something that felt rich

0:27:22.300,0:27:32.17,enough and compelling enough to keep

0:27:25.570,0:27:37.18,pounding and and that did seem to create

0:27:32.170,0:27:39.13,a sort of breaker for me and it did you

0:27:37.180,0:27:41.86,learn this revision technique where it

0:27:39.130,0:27:43.54,was what the sort of other people

0:27:41.860,0:27:44.98,include to you and developing this or

0:27:43.540,0:27:46.90,was it something you gotta know well I

0:27:44.980,0:27:50.56,have been taking workshop at the

0:27:46.900,0:27:53.38,University of Iowa for a year but it's

0:27:50.560,0:27:59.13,not my memory that we ever really spoke

0:27:53.380,0:28:02.26,about that and so it was really

0:27:59.130,0:28:07.42,compelled from the inside out it was

0:28:02.260,0:28:10.23,more the piece just wouldn't yield and

0:28:07.420,0:28:14.86,yet it wasn't going to be thrown away

0:28:10.230,0:28:18.33,either there was something in it so I

0:28:14.860,0:28:22.48,don't know my relationship to the whole

0:28:18.330,0:28:26.29,enterprise shifted I just started

0:28:22.480,0:28:30.40,working more slowly in the sense of no

0:28:26.290,0:28:33.70,less probably in fact more and and no

0:28:30.400,0:28:36.25,more slowly it just got finished a lot

0:28:33.700,0:28:40.09,more slowly yeah and there are a lot

0:28:36.250,0:28:43.87,less poems and now I write very few I

0:28:40.090,0:28:48.34,mean I'd write a lot of poems still but

0:28:43.870,0:28:54.94,it seems like a one out of a hundred

0:28:48.340,0:28:58.66,start comes to fruition at most and is

0:28:54.940,0:29:01.21,your you sort of style originated you

0:28:58.660,0:29:02.43,are you adding or subtracting or any

0:29:01.210,0:29:08.40,sort of

0:29:02.430,0:29:13.06,the combinations I am pushing into it

0:29:08.400,0:29:19.57,I'm pushing as far down into it and as

0:29:13.060,0:29:24.84,far out as I can I mean with attention

0:29:19.570,0:29:27.61,to all the aspects of poetry as I

0:29:24.840,0:29:30.64,understand it and hope that the poem

0:29:27.610,0:29:33.01,embodies you know which you Wilbur said

0:29:30.640,0:29:34.75,my intention writing a poem is to

0:29:33.010,0:29:39.46,exhaust the subject

0:29:34.750,0:29:42.07,I don't ignore that I don't ignore in my

0:29:39.460,0:29:45.91,own mind at least anything I want

0:29:42.070,0:29:50.05,everything to be you know working on

0:29:45.910,0:29:52.59,eight cylinders and and of course I

0:29:50.050,0:29:57.85,never achieve that it's an impossible

0:29:52.590,0:30:00.34,ideal but I'm trying to go into the

0:29:57.850,0:30:02.89,language and try to go deeper into the

0:30:00.340,0:30:07.18,subject and trying to make the story if

0:30:02.890,0:30:10.48,there is one or one implicit I'm working

0:30:07.180,0:30:13.84,with every aspect of it but it's

0:30:10.480,0:30:19.51,essentially you know getting a line that

0:30:13.840,0:30:23.17,might be a beginning and it containing

0:30:19.510,0:30:27.31,everything else that's the weird and

0:30:23.170,0:30:32.32,sort of mystical aspect it's all in that

0:30:27.310,0:30:40.02,piece that is driving you to complete it

0:30:32.320,0:30:44.77,yeah it has a line come up randomly

0:30:40.020,0:30:48.01,sometimes when I'm reading I was reading

0:30:44.770,0:30:50.95,this morning and it sparked something

0:30:48.010,0:30:55.35,that probably and I wrote it down but it

0:30:50.950,0:30:59.77,probably will never see the light of day

0:30:55.350,0:31:03.55,middle of the night I have to get up out

0:30:59.770,0:31:07.54,of bed turn on the light right down the

0:31:03.550,0:31:12.40,line almost never cease like this day

0:31:07.549,0:31:15.11,now and I have various repositories for

0:31:12.409,0:31:19.85,these blind but it's gotten pretty

0:31:15.110,0:31:22.30,disorganized - I used to be a lot better

0:31:19.850,0:31:25.36,at keeping them in one place but I do

0:31:22.309,0:31:27.95,try to dig it all out and look at it

0:31:25.369,0:31:31.36,sometimes especially when I'm dry or

0:31:27.950,0:31:34.70,because if teaching hasn't been able to

0:31:31.369,0:31:37.12,work on my writing for a while so to get

0:31:34.700,0:31:41.11,started again I will just look at all

0:31:37.129,0:31:43.73,this what to me is raw material the raw

0:31:41.119,0:31:46.48,material can come from anywhere come

0:31:43.730,0:31:49.27,from somebody else's writing - but it's

0:31:46.489,0:31:51.40,mostly got to come from my own it does

0:31:49.279,0:31:52.48,release like that line that you eat up

0:31:51.409,0:31:56.45,in the middle of the night you write

0:31:52.489,0:31:58.46,down what you write down well I can

0:31:56.450,0:32:02.18,write it in my journal I keep the

0:31:58.460,0:32:03.48,journal in our handwritten journal and

0:32:02.180,0:32:06.48,[Music]

0:32:03.489,0:32:11.92,or I can just write it on a piece of

0:32:06.489,0:32:14.96,folded paper how does how is the journal

0:32:11.929,0:32:17.60,relating to the right color if you give

0:32:14.960,0:32:22.21,you a whole career no that's have been

0:32:17.600,0:32:25.22,doing that for about the last 15 years

0:32:22.210,0:32:27.52,the journal for me is a seperate

0:32:25.220,0:32:29.77,enterprise it's just the kind of

0:32:27.529,0:32:33.28,vomiting but I probably wouldn't want

0:32:29.779,0:32:36.91,anybody else ever read but there's stuff

0:32:33.289,0:32:40.73,in it sometimes you know I have gone

0:32:36.919,0:32:43.87,through the exhausting narcissistic

0:32:40.730,0:32:46.78,process of rereading the journals

0:32:43.879,0:32:49.54,sometimes and right now what I've

0:32:46.789,0:32:52.19,started doing is I write the journal and

0:32:49.549,0:32:55.34,black ink and if there's something that

0:32:52.190,0:32:57.55,I want to remember for writing rose

0:32:55.340,0:33:01.97,poetry

0:32:57.559,0:33:04.42,I will underline it in blue so that I

0:33:01.970,0:33:07.35,can go back through it and see what

0:33:04.429,0:33:07.35,those things are

0:33:08.440,0:33:14.17,that the piece is you still writing a

0:33:12.409,0:33:15.24,lot but they're a lot more a lot fewer

0:33:14.179,0:33:16.47,that are kind of coming

0:33:15.240,0:33:18.90,to that level I mean how has that

0:33:16.470,0:33:20.61,changed over the course of your career

0:33:18.900,0:33:22.11,but they're more kind of bubbling up

0:33:20.610,0:33:27.09,where you have higher standards this

0:33:22.110,0:33:31.35,week it's not really standard yeah I

0:33:27.090,0:33:36.09,mean I wanted to be as good as it can be

0:33:31.350,0:33:38.58,always so the standard is you know

0:33:36.090,0:33:44.27,that's the standard whether or not I

0:33:38.580,0:33:47.46,ever achieve it or how often I do is

0:33:44.270,0:33:51.65,unfortunately not for me to say because

0:33:47.460,0:33:55.40,I would say you know that it pretty much

0:33:51.650,0:34:03.99,either achieves that standard and

0:33:55.400,0:34:09.41,simultaneously doesn't you know so again

0:34:03.990,0:34:14.82,it's just my audience for a poem is the

0:34:09.419,0:34:18.69,poem I don't what anybody else thinks of

0:34:14.820,0:34:22.83,it or even what I think of it it doesn't

0:34:18.690,0:34:26.60,matter at all to me what I want to do is

0:34:22.830,0:34:32.10,get the poem to come off of the page and

0:34:26.609,0:34:34.77,become a thing so you know again whether

0:34:32.100,0:34:40.91,or not I'm doing that that's sort of the

0:34:34.770,0:34:42.14,illusion that I'm under I don't know I

0:34:40.919,0:34:45.33,don't know

0:34:42.149,0:34:52.37,except I do know I mean I'm talking like

0:34:45.330,0:34:55.40,then yeah I mean I don't really know how

0:34:52.379,0:34:58.73,to answer that because again it depends

0:34:55.409,0:35:04.08,upon the piece so it's contingent yeah

0:34:58.730,0:35:08.22,but it feels and seems and it's you know

0:35:04.080,0:35:11.16,I interrogate my work brutally I would

0:35:08.220,0:35:14.85,never want anyone to talk to anyone else

0:35:11.160,0:35:17.43,the way that I talk to my poem I ask

0:35:14.850,0:35:20.07,them at every moment

0:35:17.430,0:35:20.62,are you interesting are you interesting

0:35:20.070,0:35:26.08,are you

0:35:20.620,0:35:30.28,interesting this is this engaging you

0:35:26.080,0:35:34.36,know I've every nanosecond of the piece

0:35:30.280,0:35:37.30,I want it to be keeps said in his

0:35:34.360,0:35:41.59,letters he wanted to load every rift

0:35:37.300,0:35:44.23,with or and he meant he was talking

0:35:41.590,0:35:47.02,about sound mostly and in that

0:35:44.230,0:35:49.81,particular context but that's what I

0:35:47.020,0:35:53.41,want to do every moment provides an

0:35:49.810,0:35:56.17,opportunity and you just don't want to

0:35:53.410,0:35:59.53,lose your attention to that

0:35:56.170,0:36:01.39,so let's and had that I mean haven't

0:35:59.530,0:36:06.19,gotten ahead of your definition of

0:36:01.390,0:36:09.31,interesting become women as you as you

0:36:06.190,0:36:13.47,frock practices has been going forward I

0:36:09.310,0:36:16.72,need to actually become wider I mean I

0:36:13.470,0:36:20.85,think I'm a little bit not much but a

0:36:16.720,0:36:24.76,little less impressive and a little less

0:36:20.850,0:36:28.45,tunnel visioned than I was when I was

0:36:24.760,0:36:34.93,young younger but my taste is not really

0:36:28.450,0:36:39.46,changed in music and painting and poetry

0:36:34.930,0:36:43.15,and I've discovered new things along the

0:36:39.460,0:36:50.97,way but I'm embarrassingly consistent

0:36:43.150,0:36:54.19,and I found a little do other people say

0:36:50.970,0:36:57.79,well I have trusted readers you know

0:36:54.190,0:37:01.51,that some of whom I've had for a very

0:36:57.790,0:37:04.00,very long time I think what you want in

0:37:01.510,0:37:08.17,a reader is somebody who loves your work

0:37:04.000,0:37:12.88,and maybe loves you but will tell you

0:37:08.170,0:37:14.53,the truth about a piece and even to the

0:37:12.880,0:37:16.66,point of saying you know this really

0:37:14.530,0:37:21.43,doesn't work at all and it belongs in

0:37:16.660,0:37:26.29,the bone pile but will tell you at every

0:37:21.430,0:37:28.35,place that doesn't work for them and you

0:37:26.290,0:37:30.41,can almost take you know and then

0:37:28.350,0:37:33.45,if you can get a group of these

0:37:30.410,0:37:37.43,responses man you can see which ones are

0:37:33.450,0:37:40.74,useful I change things because of those

0:37:37.430,0:37:44.10,responses but I also have not changed

0:37:40.740,0:37:46.14,things and how how does that work on on

0:37:44.100,0:37:47.28,the disable way and I think I had that

0:37:46.140,0:37:52.92,changed right

0:37:47.280,0:37:56.01,no it hasn't it's just a question and

0:37:52.920,0:38:00.78,it's like going to a shrink or something

0:37:56.010,0:38:03.84,or talking to a friend or a spouse it

0:38:00.780,0:38:09.27,gives you new eyes yeah you need new

0:38:03.840,0:38:14.61,eyes too you know and then you're able

0:38:09.270,0:38:19.41,to process that response because it's

0:38:14.610,0:38:22.65,concrete not abstract you can't you can

0:38:19.410,0:38:26.40,only interrogate it so far by yourself

0:38:22.650,0:38:30.33,and then you need somebody to tell you

0:38:26.400,0:38:34.53,this is this is working or this isn't

0:38:30.330,0:38:38.60,yeah in terms of lay like are you now

0:38:34.530,0:38:42.30,sending these a read email yeah before

0:38:38.600,0:38:44.31,we wish you well true they're similar

0:38:42.300,0:38:47.88,but it's a similar process same thing

0:38:44.310,0:38:51.65,same thing really do you find the

0:38:47.880,0:38:54.93,immediate evening now has changed it or

0:38:51.650,0:38:58.47,we've become terribly spoiled by the

0:38:54.930,0:39:00.72,immediacy of email I mean you send

0:38:58.470,0:39:03.20,something off and you expect something's

0:39:00.720,0:39:07.74,going to come back in the next three

0:39:03.200,0:39:09.51,three minutes and if it's something

0:39:07.740,0:39:11.94,you're particularly looking for you

0:39:09.510,0:39:15.15,check your email seven hundred twelve

0:39:11.940,0:39:19.11,times a day or you know so it takes a

0:39:15.150,0:39:21.51,real discipline for me not to do that

0:39:19.110,0:39:31.08,because I would spend all my time

0:39:21.510,0:39:34.26,otherwise so so this is the kind of

0:39:31.089,0:39:38.80,organizational archival portion of this

0:39:34.260,0:39:41.05,thing um how do you keep track of all

0:39:38.800,0:39:45.60,the work that you have come from

0:39:41.050,0:39:48.73,beginning to end well like I say can

0:39:45.609,0:39:50.26,save yourself one home for instance do

0:39:48.730,0:39:52.06,you just have here if you have many

0:39:50.260,0:39:54.60,going at the same time or are you always

0:39:52.060,0:39:58.35,working on one and then that compliment

0:39:54.609,0:40:00.33,you go I never have been able to do more

0:39:58.359,0:40:03.97,than one thing at a time

0:40:00.339,0:40:07.21,ever and so from working on yesterday

0:40:03.970,0:40:10.15,that's all I'm working on from working

0:40:07.210,0:40:13.11,on a poem that's all I'm working from

0:40:10.150,0:40:15.91,working on a nonfiction piece that's all

0:40:13.119,0:40:18.73,I'm doing I just don't have the capacity

0:40:15.910,0:40:22.29,I might you know still have lines of

0:40:18.730,0:40:25.45,columns in the middle of the night or

0:40:22.290,0:40:29.85,come to me and I will write them down

0:40:25.450,0:40:33.01,but I don't work on those I never bring

0:40:29.859,0:40:36.01,anything to completion stop this and do

0:40:33.010,0:40:39.00,this and go back to that I just have to

0:40:36.010,0:40:42.49,totally immerse myself in what I'm doing

0:40:39.000,0:40:44.74,and so once that becomes you know

0:40:42.490,0:40:46.59,version 10 or whatever on the computer

0:40:44.740,0:40:49.53,and then you moved in off the net how do

0:40:46.599,0:40:53.41,those then coalesce into the collection

0:40:49.530,0:40:57.33,well I have the final drafts of each of

0:40:53.410,0:41:00.00,the poem at a certain point you know

0:40:57.339,0:41:07.50,most books of poems are about 40 pounds

0:41:00.000,0:41:07.50,about 60 60 pages at least mine are and

0:41:08.609,0:41:15.00,so usually and somewhere in the 30s the

0:41:13.240,0:41:18.52,book will start to take shape

0:41:15.000,0:41:21.28,there might be a great a number of those

0:41:18.520,0:41:24.88,that won't make it into the book yeah

0:41:21.280,0:41:27.40,some will seem too weak I published

0:41:24.880,0:41:28.50,quite a few poems and magazines that

0:41:27.400,0:41:36.72,didn't go

0:41:28.500,0:41:40.14,into any collection ever and so there is

0:41:36.720,0:41:43.25,a process of winnowing at that point and

0:41:40.140,0:41:48.00,even more revision of individual pieces

0:41:43.250,0:41:53.43,but I will take it out of the folder

0:41:48.000,0:41:57.09,that it's in you know it'll be X 10 Y 2,
0:41:53.430,0:42:01.50,or whatever the pieces and then I'll

0:41:57.090,0:42:06.72,take the final version and just save it

0:42:01.500,0:42:09.87,into the book folder and I'll work and

0:42:06.720,0:42:13.95,I'm still working in the compositional

0:42:09.870,0:42:17.67,folder but it will then be these are

0:42:13.950,0:42:21.18,finished and these are going to go into

0:42:17.670,0:42:23.10,a book and then when you are pretty to

0:42:21.180,0:42:26.58,get any order when you have VD all of

0:42:23.100,0:42:28.98,the palms raised well print printing

0:42:26.580,0:42:32.94,will all be printed out and the final

0:42:28.980,0:42:35.79,versions and I will mess with them a

0:42:32.940,0:42:36.72,mess with the paper I could couldn't do

0:42:35.790,0:42:40.71,it any other way

0:42:36.720,0:42:42.63,yeah you have any visuals or thanks for

0:42:40.710,0:42:46.29,doing that and you put them all out on a

0:42:42.630,0:42:48.45,wall or matter I've heard of people who

0:42:46.290,0:42:51.72,do that that spread them out on the

0:42:48.450,0:42:54.96,floor and stuff but I've never done that

0:42:51.720,0:42:59.70,I do make sometimes arbitrary decisions

0:42:54.960,0:43:05.31,I basically don't like though I used it

0:42:59.700,0:43:08.19,early on sections I don't do that

0:43:05.310,0:43:13.91,anymore I don't think it's in my last

0:43:08.190,0:43:17.91,book exit I should probably check I

0:43:13.910,0:43:25.20,wanted I want I mean my preference is

0:43:17.910,0:43:28.59,for it to be one getting yeah it did so

0:43:25.200,0:43:30.93,I were to some of this collection work

0:43:28.590,0:43:32.99,did change over the course in that I

0:43:30.930,0:43:35.05,mean there's just small things but like

0:43:32.990,0:43:36.52,not moving sections

0:43:35.050,0:43:38.44,things like that but you know there's

0:43:36.520,0:43:43.93,any other changes from the earlier

0:43:38.440,0:43:46.06,career tonight in terms of component a

0:43:43.930,0:43:53.95,look at the whole once you have finished

0:43:46.060,0:43:58.21,stage no I can't really say so it's

0:43:53.950,0:44:01.57,again a process of trying to realize it

0:43:58.210,0:44:08.07,as best you can and also not publish it

0:44:01.570,0:44:13.54,until it's ready to be published and I

0:44:08.070,0:44:17.74,certainly didn't choose to be to take it

0:44:13.540,0:44:21.01,was there it's about ten years between

0:44:17.740,0:44:25.87,books of poems on the average but I also

0:44:21.010,0:44:34.18,did write three other books so they took

0:44:25.870,0:44:37.66,some time as well but I had never been

0:44:34.180,0:44:46.42,anxious to put something out before I

0:44:37.660,0:44:51.04,was happy with it okay so that's sort of

0:44:46.420,0:44:52.48,the the basic sort of profits portion is

0:44:51.040,0:44:53.80,there anything else do you think you

0:44:52.480,0:44:56.23,should mention or we should talk about

0:44:53.800,0:44:57.85,before we this is going to get a little

0:44:56.230,0:44:59.05,bit of that it is kind of another sort

0:44:57.850,0:45:02.64,of four answer like a lot of the

0:44:59.050,0:45:02.64,computer question mm-hmm

0:45:02.670,0:45:10.21,well no I mean there's also infinite

0:45:07.320,0:45:13.50,subjects to talk about but you know I

0:45:10.210,0:45:15.88,think the most interesting play this for

0:45:13.500,0:45:17.34,thinking about making it in through a

0:45:15.880,0:45:21.75,magazine

0:45:17.349,0:45:29.22,is the questions about composition yeah

0:45:21.759,0:45:33.46,yeah so I these are kind of the more

0:45:29.220,0:45:36.13,because blunter questions about computer

0:45:33.460,0:45:37.63,use and so and I think we made some of

0:45:36.130,0:45:39.22,it so when when you when did you start

0:45:37.630,0:45:43.39,using computers kind of on a regular

0:45:39.220,0:45:46.96,basis ladies probably committed in

0:45:43.390,0:45:48.48,cities it was pretty early okay and how

0:45:46.960,0:45:53.28,did you how did you have access to

0:45:48.489,0:45:56.04,secure the price I bought it yeah cost a

0:45:53.289,0:46:00.83,lot of money to at least I didn't have

0:45:56.049,0:46:04.59,much at the time yeah what have you any

0:46:00.839,0:46:08.13,friends had told me who were writers

0:46:04.599,0:46:13.74,said that you got to do this this is

0:46:08.130,0:46:16.77,amazing and wonderful and do it and you

0:46:13.749,0:46:20.89,are there be a program assistant at

0:46:16.779,0:46:25.38,Warren Wilson new computers and so I

0:46:20.890,0:46:30.33,could take some tutorials with her and

0:46:25.380,0:46:32.55,she showed me how to do it and a lot of

0:46:30.339,0:46:35.68,the writers that's a low residency

0:46:32.559,0:46:37.59,program you know two weeks every six

0:46:35.680,0:46:42.84,months a lot of the writers were going

0:46:37.599,0:46:44.92,to her at the time and well I mean does

0:46:42.849,0:46:46.50,what it is did you agree with your

0:46:44.920,0:46:51.96,friends that it was this great name they

0:46:46.509,0:46:53.92,had with the Edit uh again it was great

0:46:51.969,0:46:56.25,to be able to change things without

0:46:53.920,0:46:58.21,typing them all out again and that's

0:46:56.259,0:47:02.40,pretty much all you could do with it

0:46:58.210,0:47:07.39,there was no internet there was no email

0:47:02.400,0:47:11.17,all it was was a word processor do you

0:47:07.390,0:47:18.50,think he Saudis did that anything style

0:47:11.170,0:47:24.13,wrong cause not that I could track I

0:47:18.509,0:47:28.10,wrote letters first on the computer it

0:47:24.130,0:47:32.84,was still mail mail snail mail

0:47:28.100,0:47:35.63,and so I was composing letters on the

0:47:32.840,0:47:39.35,computer but I would compose letters on

0:47:35.630,0:47:42.38,the typewriter - I had always done that

0:47:39.350,0:47:46.46,and not written letters by hand I had

0:47:42.380,0:47:50.39,always typed them but I liked being able

0:47:46.460,0:47:54.95,to see me doing this with fingers I like

0:47:50.390,0:47:58.67,being able to do that and I think that's

0:47:54.950,0:48:02.42,what led me to start composing prose on

0:47:58.670,0:48:06.11,the computer because it was easy for me

0:48:02.420,0:48:11.84,- it was easier for me to write yes it's

0:48:06.110,0:48:14.84,physically so I guess I wonder you know

0:48:11.840,0:48:17.06,especially with I mean anything working

0:48:14.840,0:48:19.22,in kind of you know Ryan first and

0:48:17.060,0:48:21.02,formal rhymed verse for since the

0:48:19.220,0:48:25.72,beginning but I feel like it's increased

0:48:21.020,0:48:27.59,more you've gotten your later career I

0:48:25.720,0:48:28.94,wonder that was one thing I was

0:48:27.590,0:48:30.98,wondering on - reading reading your

0:48:28.940,0:48:32.87,stuff again for this question I did that

0:48:30.980,0:48:34.40,it doesn't seem though that the computer

0:48:32.870,0:48:35.48,really has any play in that I mean like

0:48:34.400,0:48:37.40,I thought there might be need you're

0:48:35.480,0:48:40.25,waiting to work with crime or anything

0:48:37.400,0:48:44.27,like that but that's not you're still

0:48:40.250,0:48:49.01,mostly doing that all on paper yes but I

0:48:44.270,0:48:52.76,have looked up I can press rhyming pairs

0:48:49.010,0:48:56.39,there's rhyming dictionaries online so

0:48:52.760,0:49:00.05,sometimes I have used those and just you

0:48:56.390,0:49:02.57,know just to see what the options are

0:49:00.050,0:49:06.26,I don't like I want to write a rhyme

0:49:02.570,0:49:06.89,poem as if it you don't even know it's

0:49:06.260,0:49:11.54,rind

0:49:06.890,0:49:17.78,unless it's purposeful that you do know

0:49:11.540,0:49:21.29,that it's crimes and so that aspect of

0:49:17.780,0:49:26.66,it but in terms of you know composition

0:49:21.290,0:49:30.19,no how is your relationship with the

0:49:26.660,0:49:33.61,computer change and I guess

0:49:30.190,0:49:36.22,very question but also I guess I'm

0:49:33.610,0:49:38.89,wondering how you feel about the files

0:49:36.220,0:49:40.21,themselves like passages were you always

0:49:38.890,0:49:42.64,kind of country interests and trying to

0:49:40.210,0:49:43.29,save them where they work means to an

0:49:42.640,0:49:48.94,end

0:49:43.290,0:49:52.47,um I don't really think about them much

0:49:48.940,0:49:55.14,I think I've had a few computers crash I

0:49:52.470,0:49:57.73,don't remember

0:49:55.140,0:50:01.57,did I ever lose anything

0:49:57.730,0:50:09.66,I don't recall I don't think so

0:50:01.570,0:50:09.66,I'm not not poetry anyway so it's just

0:50:09.930,0:50:15.46,what did I do

0:50:11.560,0:50:18.64,before computers how did I save stuff I

0:50:15.460,0:50:23.04,think just in a folder and I still do

0:50:18.640,0:50:27.31,that I still keep a physical folder of

0:50:23.040,0:50:32.44,finished poems I have the palms I finish

0:50:27.310,0:50:38.58,since this morning the one set up that's

0:50:32.440,0:50:43.60,right yeah that would be a lot for me

0:50:38.580,0:50:46.57,since 2012 there and just the file

0:50:43.600,0:50:51.64,folder upstairs the paper copies

0:50:46.570,0:50:57.91,finished the final draft site of do you

0:50:51.640,0:51:00.70,uh you have any time you lose your dear

0:50:57.910,0:51:01.36,feelings for like say maybe some of the

0:51:00.700,0:51:03.43,paper

0:51:01.360,0:51:05.41,maybe the handwritten work or any that

0:51:03.430,0:51:07.86,you feel like you try to protect it you

0:51:05.410,0:51:11.08,kind of give it extra attention or

0:51:07.869,0:51:14.68,well I do invited to dinner every when

0:51:11.080,0:51:18.34,tomorrow and take it to a movie or what

0:51:14.680,0:51:28.54,she was neglected and I panic sometimes

0:51:18.340,0:51:31.24,and speak very soft kind words um no and

0:51:28.540,0:51:34.24,they're really you know the computer a

0:51:31.240,0:51:36.76,lot more easy to repair graphical for

0:51:34.240,0:51:41.44,issues have you ever use anything or use

0:51:36.760,0:51:48.31,any of those boxes of you know do you

0:51:41.440,0:51:51.31,spell check uh no but it I don't have

0:51:48.310,0:51:54.79,spellcheck I mean the program will

0:51:51.310,0:51:59.77,underline something in red yeah if it's

0:51:54.790,0:52:01.99,misspelled um if it's misspelled I'll

0:51:59.770,0:52:05.74,correct the spelling but I don't think I

0:52:01.990,0:52:07.90,even have an automatic maybe I do I

0:52:05.740,0:52:16.33,don't know I've never used it

0:52:07.900,0:52:17.98,ah I just I want spelling these are are

0:52:16.330,0:52:20.05,you when you're writing where you

0:52:17.980,0:52:22.30,connected well you write any kind of

0:52:20.050,0:52:23.85,proposals on the computer and when

0:52:22.300,0:52:25.06,you're typing it out are you connecting

0:52:23.859,0:52:30.03,to the Internet are you using the

0:52:25.060,0:52:39.88,Internet in any way with the poem a poem

0:52:30.030,0:52:42.82,or any do it well in the act of writing

0:52:39.880,0:52:47.36,again the for the most part when I'm on

0:52:42.820,0:52:52.57,the computer for a poem I'm not I'm not

0:52:47.369,0:52:55.63,composing so I'm just typing and then I

0:52:52.570,0:52:59.14,might use the internet to look up a word

0:52:55.630,0:53:02.25,or I don't really have never really been

0:52:59.140,0:53:05.65,conscious particularly of the process

0:53:02.250,0:53:06.81,when I've written prose that involves

0:53:05.650,0:53:12.09,reference

0:53:06.810,0:53:15.93,something or I'm trying to think of what

0:53:12.090,0:53:20.43,the thing is that I want it to refer to

0:53:15.930,0:53:24.30,I will look up stuff you know that the

0:53:20.430,0:53:28.44,process of composing well I guess I'm

0:53:24.300,0:53:33.51,inside of it in the same way I'm trying

0:53:28.440,0:53:37.62,to make it work it and make it rich in

0:53:33.510,0:53:40.23,all the all the same ways except the

0:53:37.620,0:53:42.69,relationships among really among the

0:53:40.230,0:53:45.00,language and structure and what you can

0:53:42.690,0:53:46.86,do in a poem you can't add a piece of

0:53:45.000,0:53:51.36,prose and vice versa

0:53:46.860,0:53:54.24,but yeah I will however rule about it

0:53:51.360,0:53:57.39,but I will go to something if I need to

0:53:54.240,0:53:59.73,and do you remember Lexi once upon a

0:53:57.390,0:54:03.29,time here and came more of an important

0:53:59.730,0:54:07.29,part of you while working writing my I

0:54:03.290,0:54:12.32,don't even really remember very well we

0:54:07.290,0:54:20.64,went to France in 1997 and there was no

0:54:12.320,0:54:24.48,internet so that's what 17 years ago we

0:54:20.640,0:54:28.05,had no email there was I think Internet

0:54:24.480,0:54:33.62,was just kind beginning here I remember

0:54:28.050,0:54:38.40,friend of mine whose wife is a novelist

0:54:33.620,0:54:45.48,saying that his wife had sent her novel

0:54:38.400,0:54:46.96,to her agent over the wire and that was

0:54:45.480,0:54:54.75,about that time

0:54:46.960,0:54:54.75,and I thought my god that's amazing so

0:54:55.170,0:55:02.68,yeah I don't I don't really remember

0:54:59.290,0:55:06.76,when it came in to such a degree that it

0:55:02.680,0:55:09.16,became something resembling what it is

0:55:06.760,0:55:13.81,today it seems like it was a very

0:55:09.160,0:55:15.85,gradual process do you know like in you

0:55:13.810,0:55:17.59,get your books or your relationship

0:55:15.850,0:55:20.71,publishers as livers was like a

0:55:17.590,0:55:24.03,difference in changing so I was getting

0:55:20.710,0:55:26.53,your book about things beyond 2000 so

0:55:24.030,0:55:28.51,was that did you interact with the

0:55:26.530,0:55:31.36,publisher there online or did for the

0:55:28.510,0:55:35.74,diversity was the videos in selected I

0:55:31.360,0:55:40.63,as I recall there was email very shortly

0:55:35.740,0:55:44.20,after we came back from France in 199,
0:55:40.630,0:55:48.31,yeah like post last three years of the

0:55:44.200,0:55:50.55,century email kind of just became the

0:55:48.310,0:55:53.92,mode of started to become the mode of

0:55:50.550,0:55:57.31,communication and yes I was working with

0:55:53.920,0:56:00.54,a copy editor who lived in San Diego and

0:55:57.310,0:56:04.12,we would send things back and forth and

0:56:00.540,0:56:11.13,to the publisher which was in Georgia

0:56:04.120,0:56:11.13,and yeah it was all in one place by then

0:56:19.950,0:56:26.44,do you ever worry about the security or

0:56:24.220,0:56:28.21,for fixity of the file that you in the

0:56:26.440,0:56:30.04,computer files that you have nowadays of

0:56:28.210,0:56:32.83,Thomas are you is that a conscience

0:56:30.040,0:56:35.83,concern something you just like someone

0:56:32.830,0:56:40.57,would get into or more like these

0:56:35.830,0:56:44.17,computer crap you lose them well you

0:56:40.570,0:56:48.67,know I have paper copies I yeah you know

0:56:44.170,0:56:54.76,and recovery methods are pretty

0:56:48.670,0:57:00.01,sophisticated for our discs I have a old

0:56:54.760,0:57:06.55,laptop in my closet that I thought to

0:57:00.010,0:57:10.03,get the hard disk transcribed to a newer

0:57:06.550,0:57:13.27,computer I just have never done probably

0:57:10.030,0:57:15.43,impossible now I was way out of date but

0:57:13.270,0:57:19.00,outside of that one which I think did

0:57:15.430,0:57:21.61,crash I've just taken whatever is on the

0:57:19.000,0:57:25.60,hard disk of the old one and transferred

0:57:21.610,0:57:29.68,it to the hard disk of the new one and

0:57:25.600,0:57:33.37,as I said I believe this thing has

0:57:29.680,0:57:36.31,automatic backup on it I don't know how

0:57:33.370,0:57:40.30,they do that but I'm pretty ignorant of

0:57:36.310,0:57:43.14,all this stuff in it and wilfully so it

0:57:40.300,0:57:46.24,just would suck up too much of my time

0:57:43.140,0:57:48.13,to learn about it but I do know right it

0:57:46.240,0:57:50.62,should look really pretty expert and

0:57:48.130,0:57:53.91,probably it ends up using less of your

0:57:50.620,0:57:57.58,time once you learn it but I have a

0:57:53.910,0:58:00.40,physical aversion to reading manuals I

0:57:57.580,0:58:04.60,can't do any so I have a computer guy

0:58:00.400,0:58:07.93,very nice guy if any of us my wife my

0:58:04.600,0:58:10.00,daughter I have any problems I call him

0:58:07.930,0:58:19.39,up he's usually here within a couple

0:58:10.000,0:58:23.32,hours you have well only when we have a

0:58:19.390,0:58:26.50,problem but he also has that logged me

0:58:23.320,0:58:27.54,in I think it's called so he has all

0:58:26.500,0:58:30.80,three of

0:58:27.540,0:58:35.61,Judah's access to everything on them

0:58:30.800,0:58:40.97,from his office so I hope you uh

0:58:35.610,0:58:45.72,continues to like me I overpay him and

0:58:40.970,0:58:50.31,yeah I think so he he has access to

0:58:45.720,0:58:53.10,everything on all the computers so I'm

0:58:50.310,0:58:59.49,not sure if that's ridiculous or not but

0:58:53.100,0:59:02.78,he's a good guy lazy he works for the

0:58:59.490,0:59:07.59,school but he does this for us privately

0:59:02.780,0:59:12.39,so I met him through his working for the

0:59:07.590,0:59:16.32,School of Humanities virtually a sweet

0:59:12.390,0:59:19.94,guy and we talked a little bit about a

0:59:16.320,0:59:23.79,correspondence changing from Mountain

0:59:19.940,0:59:25.74,has you feel like there is do you feel

0:59:23.790,0:59:27.87,like you do more correspondence now

0:59:25.740,0:59:31.50,female or with is about the same

0:59:27.870,0:59:33.99,forthright career well as you know it's

0:59:31.500,0:59:42.72,a completely differently in a monkey you

0:59:33.990,0:59:47.04,know I mean it doesn't have a lot of

0:59:42.720,0:59:50.07,emails had no addressee and no

0:59:47.040,0:59:56.18,complimentary close is what we called it

0:59:50.070,1:00:02.55,in fourth grade sincerely Michael so

0:59:56.180,1:00:05.31,people write three words or one sentence

1:00:02.550,1:00:07.65,or for an answer to immediate questions

1:00:05.310,1:00:10.29,nothing like a letter you wouldn't write

1:00:07.650,1:00:12.41,a letter like that in terms of those

1:00:10.290,1:00:15.63,little correspond to you have

1:00:12.410,1:00:18.33,accelerators and things like that what

1:00:15.630,1:00:21.84,is there a market change in that

1:00:18.330,1:00:24.36,correspondence as well what I'm

1:00:21.840,1:00:28.86,responding is somebody's being a script

1:00:24.360,1:00:32.88,I would say there is no change so I will

1:00:28.860,1:00:35.22,write them a letter yeah essentially

1:00:32.880,1:00:36.66,what would the exact same thing that

1:00:35.220,1:00:39.70,would have

1:00:36.660,1:00:43.51,through the mail but other things

1:00:39.700,1:00:47.53,personal correspondence tends to be a

1:00:43.510,1:00:51.84,lot briefer I mean and I will still try

1:00:47.530,1:00:55.03,to be funny in emails I mean that extra

1:00:51.849,1:00:58.69,you thing I do the most and I can also

1:00:55.030,1:01:01.86,send people hilarious stuff from YouTube

1:00:58.690,1:01:06.09,or whatever and I get those back and

1:01:01.869,1:01:07.77,sometimes with some jokes or whatever so

1:01:06.099,1:01:10.59,there's changes there's also

1:01:07.770,1:01:14.58,similarities that's because it's so much

1:01:10.599,1:01:19.81,faster and so much easier and so much

1:01:14.589,1:01:23.08,you can make it short in in terms of

1:01:19.810,1:01:28.93,your your own so reading and thinking

1:01:23.080,1:01:32.10,hit you found you to finding your work

1:01:28.930,1:01:33.91,or defining you writers really I don't

1:01:32.109,1:01:37.54,like to read off the screen

1:01:33.910,1:01:40.44,yeah if I really want to read something

1:01:37.540,1:01:44.64,if it's an article in a newspaper or

1:01:40.440,1:01:48.01,something I will usually print it out

1:01:44.640,1:01:52.08,also I'm having some physical problems

1:01:48.010,1:01:57.58,using computers and probably heading for

1:01:52.089,1:02:00.01,shoulder surgery this summer and so it's

1:01:57.580,1:02:03.33,not physically comfortable to spend too

1:02:00.010,1:02:05.98,much time on it but mostly what you know

1:02:03.339,1:02:09.48,even before that I don't like to read

1:02:05.980,1:02:17.16,off the screen I like to read off a page

1:02:09.480,1:02:22.93,what did you that's a very good question

1:02:17.160,1:02:26.56,it just feels like I can I like having a

1:02:22.930,1:02:29.76,physical thing in my hands to read from

1:02:26.560,1:02:36.36,that's native to me I mean

1:02:29.769,1:02:41.32,this screams did you come in in any

1:02:36.369,1:02:46.19,significant way until about 15 years ago

1:02:41.329,1:02:51.74,you know so I was reading for many years

1:02:46.190,1:02:55.16,probably a 50 or so before that happened

1:02:51.740,1:02:58.15,I would imagine that kids are perfectly

1:02:55.160,1:03:01.36,happy reading off the screen my daughter

1:02:58.150,1:03:03.95,texts or friends all the time and gets

1:03:01.369,1:03:05.45,texts and emails and I never I don't

1:03:03.950,1:03:08.75,text anybody

1:03:05.450,1:03:12.31,I don't do text you know it's just

1:03:08.750,1:03:19.64,different unlike my grandmother with

1:03:12.319,1:03:25.49,your telephone and then I guess sort of

1:03:19.640,1:03:27.89,a little bit of Auntyji and ending but

1:03:25.490,1:03:30.14,so it had have you seen with the

1:03:27.890,1:03:35.61,computer Ozzie with all that has your

1:03:30.140,1:03:35.61,teaching change oh man

1:03:35.799,1:03:45.14,well it's a teacher's nightmare and so

1:03:40.250,1:03:47.42,far as you know you can be contacted at

1:03:45.140,1:03:51.04,any time in the night or day and you

1:03:47.420,1:03:53.96,can't live teaching without email it's

1:03:51.049,1:03:57.23,not possible anymore it's just assumed

1:03:53.960,1:03:59.77,that you're going to get notices from

1:03:57.230,1:04:02.72,school year and get communications you

1:03:59.779,1:04:05.85,just simply would not be able to

1:04:02.720,1:04:08.48,function you would be because when this

1:04:05.859,1:04:13.43,technology and this is a common place

1:04:08.480,1:04:16.91,exist it it does it just makes the other

1:04:13.430,1:04:19.86,technology completely obsolete so the

1:04:16.910,1:04:24.14,way people communicate with you before

1:04:19.869,1:04:28.54,when you were when I was teaching before

1:04:24.140,1:04:31.54,the advent of all of the stuff none of

1:04:28.549,1:04:35.29,those communications would come through

1:04:31.549,1:04:38.28,that means and now all of them do so it

1:04:35.299,1:04:41.21,isn't that you can just stop yeah and

1:04:38.289,1:04:42.21,get them from other sources because they

1:04:41.210,1:04:47.16,don't come

1:04:42.210,1:04:49.14,other sources so you know all the emails

1:04:47.160,1:04:51.66,I get from the chair of the English

1:04:49.140,1:04:53.58,department that go out to every member

1:04:51.660,1:04:58.02,of the English band they don't appear in

1:04:53.580,1:05:00.75,my mailbox which before I would get you

1:04:58.020,1:05:05.07,know every four days that I went into

1:05:00.750,1:05:08.43,school and the assumption of the time

1:05:05.070,1:05:12.75,frame has radically changed and

1:05:08.430,1:05:15.42,compressed so it just it's so much more

1:05:12.750,1:05:19.61,of your attention that it's really

1:05:15.420,1:05:21.78,necessary for me to limit that you know

1:05:19.619,1:05:26.52,I don't have an iPhone I have a dumb

1:05:21.780,1:05:37.50,phone and I don't want emails following

1:05:26.520,1:05:44.28,me around all day yeah did this kind of

1:05:37.500,1:05:46.98,I reach of email and technologies where

1:05:44.280,1:05:48.96,technological phones and custom do have

1:05:46.980,1:05:51.03,that change you write in anyway because

1:05:48.960,1:05:53.67,that impacted your times and impacted

1:05:51.030,1:05:57.06,your attention I would like to think

1:05:53.670,1:06:00.03,that but again there's an addictive

1:05:57.060,1:06:03.99,quality to being sitting on the computer

1:06:00.030,1:06:06.78,that I noticed that I'm you know check

1:06:03.990,1:06:10.05,my email and then I will look at the

1:06:06.780,1:06:12.78,weather and then I want to see what the

1:06:10.050,1:06:18.18,headlines in the New York Times are and

1:06:12.780,1:06:20.52,I'm sitting there and why get up and so

1:06:18.180,1:06:24.66,it has that quality of really drawing

1:06:20.520,1:06:30.06,you into being in relationship with it

1:06:24.660,1:06:33.39,there was a survey in the Guardian which

1:06:30.060,1:06:37.01,is a newspaper I read everyone so well

1:06:33.390,1:06:41.18,almost every day I will look at it

1:06:37.010,1:06:44.18,and the question was would you rather

1:06:41.180,1:06:48.89,give up sex or your computer for the

1:06:44.180,1:06:54.44,rest of your life and guess what 70% of

1:06:48.890,1:06:58.36,the people answered so if that isn't

1:06:54.440,1:07:03.31,insane I don't know what is or something

1:06:58.360,1:07:08.56,maybe the two are coterminous for people

1:07:03.310,1:07:12.19,but it's really become something

1:07:08.560,1:07:14.96,radically different do you feel that

1:07:12.190,1:07:17.26,your students have changed in the

1:07:14.960,1:07:20.93,cultural technological understanding

1:07:17.260,1:07:22.21,relationships with you since the rise of

1:07:20.930,1:07:29.18,the earth

1:07:22.210,1:07:34.31,um no I wouldn't say that they again

1:07:29.180,1:07:37.04,they can contact me at any time and but

1:07:34.310,1:07:40.13,that's fine with me and we may respect

1:07:37.040,1:07:44.27,me I actually contact them more than

1:07:40.130,1:07:47.89,they contact me and they're very very

1:07:44.270,1:07:52.85,considerate of my time and my attention

1:07:47.890,1:07:57.29,you know so it's not really a problem

1:07:52.850,1:07:59.72,it's just I think their relationship to

1:07:57.290,1:08:02.41,technology is very different from mine

1:07:59.720,1:08:05.78,they were talking the other day and it

1:08:02.410,1:08:08.30,had a pause in the workshop about how

1:08:05.780,1:08:10.85,many of they're still doing Facebook

1:08:08.300,1:08:13.16,there and there'll I've never done

1:08:10.850,1:08:16.75,Facebook I never would do Facebook

1:08:13.160,1:08:19.43,Facebook is my worst nightmare the idea

1:08:16.759,1:08:23.12,that anybody and I still get emails from

1:08:19.430,1:08:25.94,strangers and yeah people I used to know

1:08:23.120,1:08:31.33,and all this stuff and I don't want any

1:08:25.940,1:08:33.77,of that yes stuff and but they were

1:08:31.339,1:08:36.79,saying they do per Facebook but the

1:08:33.770,1:08:40.81,undergraduates their students four years

1:08:36.799,1:08:44.62,younger than them Facebook is passe they

1:08:40.819,1:08:50.12,don't do Facebook they do whatever

1:08:44.620,1:08:52.43,so the whole thing just kind of and I am

1:08:50.120,1:08:55.10,very much like my grandmother still

1:08:52.430,1:08:58.94,screaming into the phone because the way

1:08:55.100,1:09:02.93,she had had phones which didn't come in

1:08:58.940,1:09:06.05,till she was in pretty old to start with

1:09:02.930,1:09:11.00,was you had to crank it and you had to

1:09:06.050,1:09:12.77,shout into the thing yeah and so she

1:09:11.000,1:09:15.29,just kept doing that

1:09:12.770,1:09:18.80,leave it alone teach it when she didn't

1:09:15.290,1:09:20.87,have to yeah ah and then fucking just

1:09:18.800,1:09:23.62,finally you know in sort of my blunt any

1:09:20.870,1:09:26.24,person do you I mean you have any time

1:09:23.620,1:09:28.10,softened as to what's really changed

1:09:26.240,1:09:29.75,with the advent of computers and

1:09:28.100,1:09:32.21,relationships to writing because there's

1:09:29.750,1:09:35.14,been change in your opinion or you see

1:09:32.210,1:09:38.15,it as something that has simply

1:09:35.140,1:09:43.07,transferred kind of analog practices

1:09:38.150,1:09:47.21,into a virtual environment well I'm not

1:09:43.070,1:09:52.22,sure that I am enough to answer that

1:09:47.210,1:09:57.26,question but I am the area that it

1:09:52.220,1:10:00.86,affects most that is most important to

1:09:57.260,1:10:02.53,me is poetry and in fact I think there's

1:10:00.860,1:10:05.84,a great opportunity

1:10:02.530,1:10:12.47,palms always you know the convention

1:10:05.840,1:10:19.45,it's an artificial convention but for

1:10:12.470,1:10:23.00,the last how many hundred years at least

1:10:19.450,1:10:25.16,probably two hundred maybe even a little

1:10:23.000,1:10:28.70,more than that I've been published in

1:10:25.160,1:10:31.55,the form of books yeah that's just the

1:10:28.700,1:10:35.24,way columns that primarily appear and

1:10:31.550,1:10:39.21,also individual poems have over the last

1:10:35.240,1:10:42.22,X years been appeared in maggot

1:10:39.219,1:10:44.95,now they could I had a bomb you know

1:10:42.229,1:10:48.40,I've had a number of homes focus only

1:10:44.959,1:10:51.80,online some of those homes have been

1:10:48.409,1:10:55.24,accompanied by audio versions of the

1:10:51.800,1:11:00.49,poems some of the positive they have

1:10:55.249,1:11:04.90,video versions of it seems to me that

1:11:00.499,1:11:09.76,you know where this all could go and I

1:11:04.909,1:11:12.82,have no better idea than anyone else is

1:11:09.760,1:11:15.65,you know I hope books don't stop

1:11:12.829,1:11:18.55,existing it's one of those technologies

1:11:15.650,1:11:23.55,like a bicycle that seems like it will

1:11:18.559,1:11:26.38,never go out it's a good technology but

1:11:23.559,1:11:29.17,clearly they're also being published

1:11:26.389,1:11:34.84,poems also being published in other

1:11:29.179,1:11:43.28,forms and I have published five books

1:11:34.849,1:11:46.57,and yet there's probably 75 80 90 most

1:11:43.280,1:11:49.13,of the contents of my books are on the

1:11:46.579,1:11:52.36,lap right now without my permission I

1:11:49.130,1:11:56.30,mean they're they're just there so

1:11:52.369,1:12:00.17,anybody who wants to read poems by me or

1:11:56.300,1:12:02.57,any other poet you can find them right

1:12:00.170,1:12:07.09,there and they won't be in book form

1:12:02.570,1:12:12.94,they will be individual poems and for me

1:12:07.090,1:12:18.38,poetry is very much an auditory

1:12:12.940,1:12:21.51,experience i when I'm composing I I say

1:12:18.380,1:12:28.28,them out loud and then kind of quiet

1:12:21.519,1:12:32.57,voice I like to read homes out loud I

1:12:28.280,1:12:34.94,like to hear them read out loud I think

1:12:32.570,1:12:38.59,you get a different apprehension of them

1:12:34.940,1:12:41.84,than just reading them silently so all

1:12:38.599,1:12:44.52,that to me is for good for the good I

1:12:41.840,1:12:48.57,like healing poems online

1:12:44.520,1:12:50.81,and I like seeing how its read online

1:12:48.570,1:12:54.33,but that's less important to me then

1:12:50.810,1:13:01.08,being able to hear them so that could

1:12:54.330,1:13:07.46,really serve to make poems perhaps left

1:13:01.080,1:13:13.59,leg cross yeah this technology has to be

1:13:07.460,1:13:15.75,written to the media exactly and you can

1:13:13.590,1:13:21.12,read it and listen to it at the same

1:13:15.750,1:13:22.26,time if you want and then I'm sort of a

1:13:21.120,1:13:24.78,should feel like when you can you're

1:13:22.260,1:13:27.75,composing your you're also reading it

1:13:24.780,1:13:30.45,out loud like mine my lines I do I

1:13:27.750,1:13:39.63,always do that yeah I feel like a little

1:13:30.450,1:13:47.06,whisper all done yes good thank you

1:13:39.630,1:13:47.06,Devin I was funny and fun is important I

1:13:47.690,1:14:01.85,hope I got everything worked
