<h1>Who Done It?</h1>

<strong>Devin Becker</strong> is the Director of the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL) and the Head of Data & Digital Services at the University of Idaho Library, where he directs and maintains the library's digital initiatives program. His library work has been awarded funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the Idaho Humanities Council (IHC), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the US Agricultural Information Network (USAIN). In 2014, he was named a Library Journal Mover & Shaker.

Becker is also a writer. His first collection of poetry, Shame | Shame, was selected by David St. John as the winner of the thirteenth annual A. Poulin, Jr. Poetry Prize and was published by BOA Editions LTD in 2015. Becker has published poetry and research articles in American Archivist, Cutbank, Microform and Digitization Review, Midwestern Gothic, Prairie Schooner, and elsewhere. He is currently serving as a 2017-2019 Idaho Commission for the Arts Literature Fellow.

Becker received a B.A. in English and Religion from Williams College, an MFA in English (Poetry) from the University of California, Irvine, and a Masters of Library Science from Indiana University. He lives in Moscow, Idaho with his wife, daughter, and dog (Rufus).

Becker was born and raised in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and remains to this day much too emotionally invested in the Indiana Hoosier basketball team.

Current projects include co-coordinating the POP-UP PROSE reading series in Moscow, Idaho, and serving as the Nonfiction Editor of Fugue. 

<h1>Methodology and Collaboration</h1>

The 11 interviews themselves are the product of Devin Becker's 2013-2014 road trip to each of the poets' homes, with questions primarily focused on shifts in each poet’s physical (i.e. drafting) and creative (i.e. research and inspiration) processes in relation to the dawn of personal computing. Though roughly the same questions were asked of each poet, the variance of responses is the data Becker was most interested in.

After some time away from the project, Becker dove back in and realized just how much data he'd gathered, and that he'd need some help organizing it into something bigger. In May of 2017, Becker brought on University of Idaho MFA students Lauren Westerfield and Corey Oglesby (who you can learn more about at www.coreyoglesby.com) as research assistants, and the team got right to work scaffolding the project.

Using the GitHub platform as an initial organizational tool, the team broke the project into various tasks, assigned them to each other, and met frequently over the course of the summer of 2017 to check in on general progress. Building the Ctrl+Shift website from scratch, these tasks included everything from advanced HTML and CSS coding to illustrating portraits of the poets interviewed. With the end goal being to thoroughly analyze the data and draw conclusions, the team understood that first getting the data all in one place was key. Thus, the source material—the interviews—were each deconstructed by question-asked, topic, and general theme in multiple, different ways so as to afford new and interesting angles from which to dissect and analyze them.

Once this work was done (and after a much needed break), the team regrouped in May 2018 to begin actual analysis. (MORE....)
