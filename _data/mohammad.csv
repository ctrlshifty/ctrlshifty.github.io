Digital Devices,0:00:00,"The poems are usually shorter, and again because of the specific nature of the composition, in some cases, you'll see I can't revise it really well at all if it's not on a computer.",0
Backing-up and Archiving,0:04:15,"I've got a server here on campus. It's a backup server that I save things to. It's very simple. All I'd need to do is drag stuff right now, and I could do it to stop worrying about it. I've also got an external hard drive at home.",255
Writing Career,0:06:27,"Typically, I'd get no response, or maybe a slip saying, 'Sorry, this journal is no longer in circulation' because the only way I heard about them in the first place was from the library copies. I had no contact with any of the people involved...the internet changed that.",387
Initial Composition Process,0:09:40,I don't think I had much of a method. I think I was really just kind of feeling around in the dark.,580
Evolution of Process: The Beginnings of Flarf,0:11:42,"[The] second stage had kind of like two stages. At first, I became acquainted with Gary [Sullivan]'s writing on an email list that we were both on, and just for a joke he wrote some kind of New Year's poem, or something like that, that he called a flarf poem. 'Flarf' was the invented name for the method. It was basically just writing the stupidest,  most shapeless thing you could think of.",702
Evolution of Process: Fine-tuned Flarf,0:23:45,"Even if the poems themselves have like ridiculous vocabulary and images&#8212;you know, junk food, or porn site terminology, or whatever else comes off the internet&#8212;I would be looking for rhythm.",1425
Revising Flarf,0:26:11,"The one constant was the importance of the idea that was generated by the search. I don't see the need to mask the method. I think one of the pleasures, for me, of reading other work like that by other people is knowing, 'Oh, they did this by using a particular procedure.' And I'm still most interested in how the finished work affects me.",1571
The Sonograms,0:32:11,"It's like: go to the internet and find a sonnet, copy it, and paste it in to a Word doc. Then: 'Okay&#8212;what can I do in the next five or ten minutes using this as my source?' I'd say, 'Here, I wrote a poem for this silly tradition.'",1931
Collaborative Flarfing,0:42:30,"The most stimulating thing about being on the list&#8212;just feeding off everyone else's excitement and creativity, because it was very much a big hug fest. There was almost nothing critical going on in there, ever.",2550
The Death of Flarf and Lessons-Learned,0:47:13,"I think 'Death of Flarf,' most of the time, was a phrase we used ourselves just to kind of, like, kill the beast before it killed us, or something. But I think it just ran its course.",2833
Flarf as a Teaching Tool,0:54:34,"It has to be fun on some level. I mean, I wouldn't necessarily frame it as Flarf in the classroom in this way, but I think one of the first things I try to do in the beginning in the classroom is break down the sense of over-seriousness that sometimes holds people back.",3274
