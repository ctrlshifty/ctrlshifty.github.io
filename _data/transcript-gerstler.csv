0:01:25.710,0:01:33.00,I have it's kind of in three sections

0:01:29.490,0:01:34.77,okay the first section is kind of a more

0:01:33.000,0:01:37.20,quick short answer stuff about what

0:01:34.770,0:01:38.52,you're doing now um and it's based off a

0:01:37.200,0:01:41.36,thing that I don't know if you might

0:01:38.520,0:01:42.99,call your notice it was in my year she

0:01:41.369,0:01:44.70,didn't actually wasn't in no I don't

0:01:42.990,0:01:47.49,think I was this but she has a book from

0:01:44.700,0:01:50.13,four ways she's a nice anyway we did an

0:01:47.490,0:01:52.43,article earlier that interviewed kind of

0:01:50.130,0:01:54.11,emerging so it's about how they did this

0:01:52.439,0:01:55.50,is one more questions are from that okay

0:01:54.119,0:01:57.11,and then we'll talk more about the kind

0:01:55.500,0:02:00.09,of span of your career and how the

0:01:57.119,0:02:02.36,process have changed or not changed with

0:02:00.090,0:02:04.92,the computer okay uh but it's more I

0:02:02.369,0:02:06.06,mean it's that you don't need to feel

0:02:04.920,0:02:07.56,like you need to talk about the speeder

0:02:06.060,0:02:08.70,you don't just talk about how you work

0:02:07.560,0:02:11.11,and about that

0:02:08.700,0:02:14.11,and then the third one will be kind of a

0:02:11.110,0:02:15.84,series of questions more about I guess

0:02:14.110,0:02:17.47,your feelings about the computer and I

0:02:15.849,0:02:21.40,have a couple questions the end and that

0:02:17.470,0:02:23.76,would be it hi okay so this is the

0:02:21.400,0:02:25.65,section where we talk about how you're

0:02:23.769,0:02:29.11,working currently and that looks like

0:02:25.659,0:02:32.14,it's working so if you wouldn't mind

0:02:29.110,0:02:34.09,stating a your name your date of birth

0:02:32.140,0:02:38.68,and where we are right now okay

0:02:34.090,0:02:45.78,so my name is Amy girth blur um I was

0:02:38.680,0:02:49.72,born in October 24th 1956 and we're in

0:02:45.780,0:02:50.85,the area of Los Angeles California USA

0:02:49.720,0:02:52.93,that's called

0:02:50.859,0:02:56.25,Echo Park which is close to downtown

0:02:52.930,0:02:59.79,close to Dodger Stadium okay

0:02:56.250,0:03:02.70,and also joining us also joining us as

0:02:59.799,0:03:05.76,guest stars

0:03:02.700,0:03:11.10,taking all the glory as is appropriate

0:03:05.769,0:03:15.16,is Ted the dog and Gus the dog okay so

0:03:11.109,0:03:19.84,what what a genre is do you working I

0:03:15.160,0:03:23.16,write poetry I write I do different

0:03:19.840,0:03:27.22,kinds of journalism more in the past and

0:03:23.169,0:03:29.20,currently but still some I used to do a

0:03:27.220,0:03:31.95,fair amount of arts journalism write

0:03:29.200,0:03:36.37,reviews and sometimes catalog pieces and

0:03:31.959,0:03:38.98,sometimes essays about visual art and I

0:03:36.370,0:03:40.20,did other kinds of general journal and

0:03:38.980,0:03:45.16,what would you say your primer and I've

0:03:40.209,0:03:45.54,written some nonfiction or um a bit of

0:03:45.160,0:03:51.45,fiction

0:03:45.549,0:03:54.01,sorta all right so also many men hybrid

0:03:51.459,0:03:56.85,stuff do you write but you're from you

0:03:54.010,0:03:59.70,would say your primary genres but poetry

0:03:56.859,0:04:02.98,and some foods and nonfiction some of

0:03:59.709,0:04:05.50,which is journals what kinds of devices

0:04:02.980,0:04:07.93,you have own or have access to for your

0:04:05.500,0:04:14.17,writing computer devices

0:04:07.930,0:04:20.91,um this laptop is my home computer and

0:04:14.170,0:04:25.57,then I have to sort of travel ones one

0:04:20.919,0:04:28.90,is a MacBook Air which is like this but

0:04:25.570,0:04:34.50,much lighter and Center and then one is

0:04:28.900,0:04:36.37,an iPad Mini which I don't write on that

0:04:34.509,0:04:38.44,much but I write on a little and it's

0:04:36.370,0:04:42.52,like an iPad but it's a little smaller

0:04:38.440,0:04:45.13,it's like kind of purse size yeah so you

0:04:42.520,0:04:47.97,have so then you have three devices on

0:04:45.130,0:04:48.34,which you kind of write between that's

0:04:47.979,0:04:51.63,right

0:04:48.340,0:04:53.11,how do you share the document do you

0:04:51.639,0:04:55.90,share the documents between the three is

0:04:53.110,0:04:57.91,are there is there a way that you or two

0:04:55.900,0:04:58.66,used to send them to yourself I mean I'm

0:04:57.910,0:05:02.47,not

0:04:58.660,0:05:07.57,I like tech and I like computers but I'm

0:05:02.470,0:05:12.28,not as savvy as I should be so I send

0:05:07.570,0:05:14.71,things to myself via email that's

0:05:12.280,0:05:16.78,usually the main way I do it sometimes I

0:05:14.710,0:05:23.11,can plug them into each other yeah and

0:05:16.780,0:05:25.90,have them share yeah and so they're all

0:05:23.110,0:05:29.26,Macs yes and and this is your primary

0:05:25.900,0:05:31.41,device though that's it okay there's

0:05:29.260,0:05:33.52,also one at work but I just use that for

0:05:31.419,0:05:37.81,work I don't good Jung is that's

0:05:33.520,0:05:40.41,actually right it's for work yeah do you

0:05:37.810,0:05:42.00,use a in addition to your digital

0:05:40.419,0:05:44.13,environments are you using physical are

0:05:42.009,0:05:44.47,using handwriting or notebooks or

0:05:44.139,0:05:48.31,anything

0:05:44.470,0:05:53.90,sure okay and so how what's what's the

0:05:48.310,0:05:57.66,sort of ratio between the two Rachele I

0:05:53.909,0:05:59.71,mean how much are you working on kind of

0:05:57.669,0:06:01.41,physical formats versus digital formats

0:05:59.710,0:06:03.22,I guess and we'll get back to this so if

0:06:01.419,0:06:04.59,you don't want to this isn't we can get

0:06:03.220,0:06:10.36,we can talk I'm gonna do

0:06:04.599,0:06:13.75,I think actual writing is almost all on

0:06:10.360,0:06:20.41,computers now but note-taking yeah it's

0:06:13.750,0:06:24.97,probably 75%

0:06:20.410,0:06:32.25,notebooks in 10 and 25% take notes on

0:06:24.979,0:06:35.30,the computer at what point would your

0:06:32.259,0:06:36.65,notes kind of read it like say you're

0:06:35.300,0:06:40.66,like a physical notes lead into a

0:06:36.650,0:06:42.59,computer document what do they usually

0:06:40.669,0:06:48.74,lead to a poem like that or is that a

0:06:42.590,0:06:53.51,different might yeah I often my sort of

0:06:48.740,0:06:55.13,poetry practice involves different kinds

0:06:53.510,0:06:56.87,of weird different kinds of research

0:06:55.130,0:07:00.68,yeah

0:06:56.870,0:07:03.32,and so that's digital because a lot of

0:07:00.680,0:07:05.71,the research I do now is online and I

0:07:03.320,0:07:09.16,often print things out and then either

0:07:05.710,0:07:13.16,and highlight parts of them and use them

0:07:09.169,0:07:17.69,or take notes out of books or take notes

0:07:13.160,0:07:20.90,off of websites on a on paper and then

0:07:17.690,0:07:23.12,input it does that answer the question

0:07:20.900,0:07:24.59,yeah yeah and some of this will be a

0:07:23.120,0:07:26.33,little repetitive and I hope it doesn't

0:07:24.590,0:07:29.53,bother you no not at all when you're

0:07:26.330,0:07:30.80,trying to gather data yeah so yeah but

0:07:29.539,0:07:35.75,so we'll talk more about that yeah yeah

0:07:30.800,0:07:38.21,I get that okay cool okay what format do

0:07:35.750,0:07:44.38,you save your files um

0:07:38.210,0:07:45.40,words docx okay and as you're creating

0:07:44.389,0:07:48.59,drafts

0:07:45.409,0:07:50.65,unless someone needs a PDF a PDF or

0:07:48.590,0:07:56.41,unless someone has an old computer and

0:07:50.659,0:07:58.09,have to have dot docx yes okay and then

0:07:56.419,0:08:00.86,as you're working on individual pieces

0:07:58.099,0:08:03.11,on your computer do you save over what

0:08:00.860,0:08:06.53,you've written or do you write do you

0:08:03.110,0:08:12.55,save new drafts for each one or the

0:08:06.530,0:08:12.55,combination it's a combination okay

0:08:12.639,0:08:15.90,what are you naming conventions for your

0:08:14.960,0:08:24.22,files

0:08:15.909,0:08:26.53,I try to and the names change because I

0:08:24.220,0:08:28.82,was so happy when I realized that you

0:08:26.539,0:08:31.43,could change the names because I start

0:08:28.820,0:08:32.61,out this is more two poems than anything

0:08:31.430,0:08:33.83,else but

0:08:32.610,0:08:38.78,sometimes I'll start out calling

0:08:33.839,0:08:40.44,something you know ostrich parade or

0:08:38.789,0:08:42.14,something and then by the time I get to

0:08:40.440,0:08:43.46,the fifth draft there's no ostriches in

0:08:42.149,0:08:45.99,it anymore and what I'm going to

0:08:43.469,0:08:48.26,remember is something else okay in order

0:08:45.990,0:08:51.54,to be able to find it quickly so I will

0:08:48.260,0:08:55.01,change the name so the title is like a

0:08:51.540,0:08:58.32,prompt for your own memory so the title

0:08:55.019,0:09:00.48,is a prompt for findability okay so

0:08:58.320,0:09:02.22,click find a bit is really going to be

0:09:00.480,0:09:04.26,the title it's just maybe something that

0:09:02.220,0:09:05.70,that's right that's right sometimes it

0:09:04.260,0:09:07.47,is and sometimes it isn't and sometimes

0:09:05.700,0:09:09.89,later on down the line one and I

0:09:07.470,0:09:13.41,actually finally do title the thing yeah

0:09:09.899,0:09:14.88,I will change the name again yeah and as

0:09:13.410,0:09:17.61,you're going through drafts you add

0:09:14.880,0:09:22.50,numbers I do if I'm saying if I'm saving

0:09:17.610,0:09:24.44,draft and if I think if and what

0:09:22.500,0:09:27.08,determines whether I say addresses if I

0:09:24.440,0:09:28.44,if I want to trash old drafts because I

0:09:27.089,0:09:30.60,know I don't want to go back to them if

0:09:28.440,0:09:34.70,I think I might want to go back to them

0:09:30.600,0:09:41.39,for some reason do you print out your

0:09:34.709,0:09:44.82,writing to revise it sometimes yeah I'll

0:09:41.399,0:09:48.36,do like a bunch of drafts just revising

0:09:44.820,0:09:51.99,on the computer and then at certain

0:09:48.360,0:09:55.68,points I'll print it out and mark it up

0:09:51.990,0:09:58.11,by hand and then then input the changes

0:09:55.680,0:10:00.39,do you save any car like you save those

0:09:58.110,0:10:03.64,copies no no if they're just kind of

0:10:00.390,0:10:08.33,means to the to the final part yes

0:10:03.649,0:10:11.31,do you often back up your work your Word

0:10:08.339,0:10:12.87,document files um I have Carbonite okay

0:10:11.310,0:10:15.20,you do yeah so it's backed up in the

0:10:12.870,0:10:17.04,cloud and and that's cute optics I went

0:10:15.209,0:10:18.48,through all different kinds of backup

0:10:17.040,0:10:22.29,things I've had all different kinds of

0:10:18.480,0:10:23.91,viruses and crashes and you know yeah

0:10:22.290,0:10:25.98,and so do you find this

0:10:23.910,0:10:27.77,I've got religion about backing of it

0:10:25.980,0:10:30.69,you know you have you've had experiences

0:10:27.779,0:10:34.31,where you've lost I've had viruses and

0:10:30.690,0:10:38.99,I've had bad computer crashes okay

0:10:34.310,0:10:38.99,anything where you lost significant work

0:10:41.200,0:10:54.45,um not not so much but the virus stuff

0:10:50.700,0:10:57.57,destroyed a computer and was expensive

0:10:54.459,0:11:01.32,and really time-consuming and really

0:10:57.579,0:11:10.00,nerve-racking so yeah so it was like

0:11:01.320,0:11:11.86,never again as possible so so you have

0:11:10.000,0:11:13.57,you have a carbonite and they're all

0:11:11.860,0:11:16.20,save you you connect to that Carbonite

0:11:13.570,0:11:18.94,folder two different devices or you just

0:11:16.209,0:11:21.76,have that folder on this device I just

0:11:18.940,0:11:24.69,have it on this device because every

0:11:21.760,0:11:27.31,this is the central one there's nothing

0:11:24.690,0:11:29.88,when I do things on other devices I make

0:11:27.310,0:11:35.50,sure they come here if I care about them

0:11:29.889,0:11:37.57,yeah okay do you when you're when you

0:11:35.500,0:11:39.33,say you're finished with the poem how do

0:11:37.570,0:11:41.41,you what's your is there protocol for

0:11:39.339,0:11:43.81,saving that in a certain place you do

0:11:41.410,0:11:47.52,you move it to a different place or it

0:11:43.810,0:11:52.08,goes into a different folder okay and I

0:11:47.529,0:11:54.39,usually print out a hard copy and I have

0:11:52.089,0:11:57.27,a sort of one of these kind of notebook

0:11:54.399,0:12:01.58,okay that I yeah put it into yeah see

0:11:57.279,0:12:01.58,several think about briefly husband hmm

0:12:01.740,0:12:06.91,then so you do keep print you do keep

0:12:05.019,0:12:08.89,print copies of your final drafts and

0:12:06.910,0:12:10.72,are they organized are the others like

0:12:08.890,0:12:12.64,leading to the next manuscript yeah and

0:12:10.720,0:12:15.27,that's why because that's the form that

0:12:12.640,0:12:16.57,it's going to be and delivered in if I'm

0:12:15.279,0:12:20.01,lucky enough to get something published

0:12:16.570,0:12:22.93,right now it's not I'm not doing digital

0:12:20.019,0:12:24.22,book so I write I also want to be able

0:12:22.930,0:12:26.47,to look at it yeah

0:12:24.220,0:12:29.17,form that it's going to exist in and

0:12:26.470,0:12:31.24,play with it do you once they're in that

0:12:29.170,0:12:34.48,folder do you still end up going back

0:12:31.240,0:12:36.69,and revising sure okay sure you know

0:12:34.480,0:12:38.26,those usually smaller do you ever go

0:12:36.699,0:12:39.91,back and do larger visions in there or

0:12:38.260,0:12:44.29,is it usually kind of like moving lines

0:12:39.910,0:12:47.19,or changing words or depends I would say

0:12:44.290,0:12:50.17,moderate revisions and also if you

0:12:47.199,0:12:52.10,consider getting you know tossing poems

0:12:50.170,0:12:54.70,off the team yeah

0:12:52.100,0:12:57.82,a revision then yeah I do a lot of that

0:12:54.709,0:12:59.87,yeah do you have any sort of standard

0:12:57.829,0:13:01.19,ways that you once everything is done

0:12:59.870,0:13:02.81,and finished you have like a standard

0:13:01.190,0:13:05.18,archiving process like where you have

0:13:02.810,0:13:06.88,like a folder you never touch or a place

0:13:05.180,0:13:12.44,you keep all the all that like those

0:13:06.889,0:13:17.54,from before well um yeah I have those

0:13:12.440,0:13:21.76,from before but also if I'm lucky enough

0:13:17.540,0:13:24.56,to publish a book then there's a file

0:13:21.769,0:13:26.48,here that's what I sent to the publisher

0:13:24.560,0:13:28.27,okay and you keep that with all your

0:13:26.480,0:13:31.31,other in that carbon i folder with

0:13:28.279,0:13:34.81,everything else well Carmen I just backs

0:13:31.310,0:13:37.67,out there right right yeah and then also

0:13:34.810,0:13:41.06,allegedly eventually there's an actual

0:13:37.670,0:13:43.63,book yeah so then it exists in at least

0:13:41.060,0:13:45.44,three forms okay and you consider you

0:13:43.639,0:13:47.26,can sit which one would you consider the

0:13:45.440,0:13:52.19,kind of final product would it be the

0:13:47.269,0:13:54.38,book um yeah yeah that's what I'm

0:13:52.190,0:13:57.76,working towards yeah you know the book

0:14:08.269,0:14:20.77,archiving no I've been meaning it you

0:14:18.949,0:14:23.60,know I've talked to friends about what

0:14:20.779,0:14:26.18,the best backup systems okay are and

0:14:23.600,0:14:28.60,I've talked to people in the computer

0:14:26.180,0:14:31.33,store about this because of

0:14:28.600,0:14:34.16,aforementioned bad experiences I wanted

0:14:31.339,0:14:37.88,to have like five different systems and

0:14:34.160,0:14:41.01,yeah really be safe okay

0:14:37.880,0:14:43.18,great okay well that's the sort of uh

0:14:52.250,0:14:56.06,long ship well he just needs to know

0:14:54.380,0:15:03.94,what's going on don't you Ted oh yeah

0:14:56.060,0:15:05.25,you too oh great guy all right so this

0:15:03.949,0:15:11.62,is more

0:15:05.250,0:15:12.76,sort of broadly speaking and I have to

0:15:11.620,0:15:14.82,to start and I'll explain a few things

0:15:12.760,0:15:18.55,within vocal cord so how long have you

0:15:14.829,0:15:21.37,been writing professionally and that's I

0:15:18.550,0:15:24.26,know that's a wishy-washy term but no I

0:15:21.370,0:15:24.26,mean ah

0:15:28.649,0:15:39.79,I'm 57 and I've been writing you know

0:15:36.000,0:15:44.07,started publishing you know small poems

0:15:39.790,0:15:48.01,in school magazines you know back when I

0:15:44.079,0:15:52.08,was in college when I was you know 18 1,
0:15:48.010,0:15:54.51,20 so if you start it there then that

0:15:52.089,0:15:57.51,amount of years if you started when I

0:15:54.519,0:16:00.91,hadn't you know my first chapbook and it

0:15:57.519,0:16:03.25,would have been like after I finished

0:16:00.910,0:16:04.63,college well and this is kind of I mean

0:16:03.250,0:16:07.38,leading up to the next question which is

0:16:04.630,0:16:09.25,kind of a broad question but could you

0:16:07.389,0:16:10.81,describe kind of the arc of your career

0:16:09.250,0:16:13.02,like where's you know where it started

0:16:10.810,0:16:14.74,when you started to write the poems as

0:16:13.029,0:16:22.26,you consider your poems and then kind of

0:16:14.740,0:16:22.26,how it moves through time up to now I

0:16:23.279,0:16:40.69,well I published a small chat book up

0:16:35.560,0:16:44.44,maybe a year or two after I finished

0:16:40.690,0:16:47.14,college when I was 21 so where were you

0:16:44.440,0:16:49.39,guys I went to Pitzer College which is

0:16:47.140,0:16:53.17,one of the claremont colleges there in

0:16:49.390,0:16:54.69,California uh-huh and then and did you I

0:16:53.170,0:16:56.26,mean so you can talk about like who you

0:16:54.699,0:16:57.55,studied with or anything like that but I

0:16:56.260,0:17:00.45,mean so you went from we published a

0:16:57.550,0:17:04.05,chat book and then this windy and the

0:17:00.459,0:17:07.24,new first book was like 1981 or I had

0:17:04.059,0:17:09.93,that I was lucky enough to have this guy

0:17:07.240,0:17:13.29,Dennis Cooper who was kind of my mentor

0:17:09.939,0:17:15.33,and friend had this wonderful press

0:17:13.299,0:17:18.56,called Little Caesar press and he did a

0:17:15.339,0:17:21.77,small chat book of mine and then

0:17:18.569,0:17:24.44,David Trinidad is a terrific poet who

0:17:21.779,0:17:27.71,teaches at Columbia College in Chicago

0:17:24.449,0:17:30.75,but used to live here for a long time

0:17:27.710,0:17:33.87,had a small press called Sherwood press

0:17:30.750,0:17:38.34,and he did another chat book of mine and

0:17:33.870,0:17:40.67,then after that actually someone who

0:17:38.340,0:17:44.27,wasn't my friend who was actually almost

0:17:40.679,0:17:45.80,a stranger published an actual non chat

0:17:44.279,0:17:49.08,book which is you know a book with

0:17:45.809,0:17:53.03,itself a thin spine but an actual spine

0:17:49.080,0:17:56.00,rather than staple this bitching um what

0:17:53.039,0:18:01.04,book was that that book was called early

0:17:56.009,0:18:09.37,heaven okay so that was the first one

0:18:01.049,0:18:14.19,that was um a little bigger and then I

0:18:09.379,0:18:16.83,went on to publish around thirteen book

0:18:14.190,0:18:19.83,about some of them chat books some of

0:18:16.830,0:18:24.41,them actual single volumes of poetry

0:18:19.830,0:18:26.07,yeah and some of them odd little

0:18:24.419,0:18:27.89,projects like collaborative books with

0:18:26.070,0:18:32.46,artists or collaborative book with a

0:18:27.899,0:18:35.42,fiction writer and during this time were

0:18:32.460,0:18:37.62,you teaching were you working at other I

0:18:35.429,0:18:41.75,mean pockets how were you supporting

0:18:37.620,0:18:44.73,your writing well I was going to be a

0:18:41.759,0:18:47.66,speech pathologist or and or work with

0:18:44.730,0:18:50.75,autistic kids yeah I was a child

0:18:47.669,0:18:53.61,psychology major and in college I was

0:18:50.759,0:18:56.37,always interested in poetry and loved it

0:18:53.610,0:19:01.11,and got to take a couple classes at

0:18:56.370,0:19:02.85,Pitzer from this amazing poet who's not

0:19:01.110,0:19:08.90,as well-known as he should be in isn't

0:19:02.850,0:19:14.10,alive anymore named Burt Myers but I was

0:19:08.909,0:19:20.90,kind of on the path to work with kids

0:19:14.100,0:19:23.48,who had speech problems yeah but I when

0:19:20.909,0:19:25.76,I graduated from college I wanted to

0:19:23.480,0:19:28.40,have some time to work on my poetry

0:19:25.769,0:19:30.84,because I'd just been yeah in school

0:19:28.409,0:19:31.13,wall-to-wall like many of us straight

0:19:30.840,0:19:34.52,from

0:19:31.130,0:19:37.76,school to college so I took some time

0:19:34.520,0:19:39.53,off and I'm moved to LA I was accepted

0:19:37.760,0:19:43.73,to a speech pathology program at Boston

0:19:39.530,0:19:45.83,University and but I wanted to meet

0:19:43.730,0:19:49.22,other writers and I wanted to try to

0:19:45.830,0:19:52.52,make my writing better and I started

0:19:49.220,0:19:54.65,taking odd jobs I worked for different

0:19:52.520,0:19:56.60,doctors in the front office and in the

0:19:54.650,0:20:02.12,back office washing off instruments and

0:19:56.600,0:20:04.37,answering phones and I worked helping

0:20:02.120,0:20:10.90,take care of a schizophrenic woman and I

0:20:04.370,0:20:16.34,I worked all kinds of funny odd jobs and

0:20:10.900,0:20:19.58,that wanting to improve my writing and

0:20:16.340,0:20:22.76,read more and write more and learn more

0:20:19.580,0:20:25.16,about poetry and come into contact with

0:20:22.760,0:20:26.87,other writers kind of turned into my

0:20:25.160,0:20:28.67,life so I'm still trying to make my

0:20:26.870,0:20:32.18,poetry better and learn more and read

0:20:28.670,0:20:36.11,more and somewhere along the way I got

0:20:32.180,0:20:37.55,some jobs at a non-profit literary arts

0:20:36.110,0:20:39.47,center that's called beyond baroque

0:20:37.550,0:20:40.85,which still exists in Venice

0:20:39.470,0:20:44.03,I worked there in a bunch of different

0:20:40.850,0:20:47.48,capacities in the library a little tiny

0:20:44.030,0:20:49.70,not official library yeah sincere yes

0:20:47.480,0:20:54.59,and one of those exalted breed a

0:20:49.700,0:20:57.38,librarian and I helped with the reading

0:20:54.590,0:21:02.51,series and events and publicity and did

0:20:57.380,0:21:05.32,different jobs there and then because I

0:21:02.510,0:21:09.17,my friend Dennis Cooper helped me get a

0:21:05.320,0:21:14.66,little job writing art reviews for this

0:21:09.170,0:21:16.49,magazine art forum yeah that suddenly I

0:21:14.660,0:21:18.41,was very lucky and I was writing these

0:21:16.490,0:21:20.81,monthly art reviews for art form which

0:21:18.410,0:21:22.88,didn't pay very much but it made people

0:21:20.810,0:21:26.36,think that I was an art critic

0:21:22.880,0:21:29.21,right so I couldn't get any teaching

0:21:26.360,0:21:32.06,jobs teaching writing initially but I

0:21:29.210,0:21:35.03,did get hired as a kind of art critic so

0:21:32.060,0:21:40.31,I started teaching in art schools and

0:21:35.030,0:21:42.11,then as I and wrote more and did more

0:21:40.310,0:21:44.73,different kinds of journalism I was able

0:21:42.110,0:21:46.95,to get teaching jobs teaching

0:21:44.730,0:21:49.47,writing so I worked at a bunch of

0:21:46.950,0:21:52.79,different colleges and I had a job at a

0:21:49.470,0:21:55.65,low residency program and wonderful

0:21:52.799,0:21:57.39,program the writing seminars at

0:21:55.650,0:22:00.24,Bennington College so I'd go to Vermont

0:21:57.390,0:22:03.48,twice a year and I taught at USC and a

0:22:00.240,0:22:04.62,Caltech and at my alma mater I taught at

0:22:03.480,0:22:07.02,the University of Utah

0:22:04.620,0:22:09.75,CalArts bunch of different places great

0:22:07.020,0:22:11.85,and then now and now you're at

0:22:09.750,0:22:15.36,University of California at Irvine well

0:22:11.850,0:22:20.66,I've had this job just for a year and I

0:22:15.360,0:22:25.35,was super lucky can I believe it to get

0:22:20.669,0:22:27.79,that job okay so that's so that kind of

0:22:25.350,0:22:31.65,gives us a framework to work in and then

0:22:27.799,0:22:33.63,what I sort of divided the sections into

0:22:31.650,0:22:35.85,kind of three decrement top of the

0:22:33.630,0:22:37.26,process and like the first part of the

0:22:35.850,0:22:38.79,sort of three three part process the

0:22:37.260,0:22:41.10,first part being a kind of compositional

0:22:38.790,0:22:43.14,prewriting generative process the second

0:22:41.100,0:22:45.24,being a revision sort of process and the

0:22:43.140,0:22:46.95,third being an organizational or

0:22:45.240,0:22:48.48,archival where the part where you're

0:22:46.950,0:22:50.49,kind of finishing putting these in books

0:22:48.480,0:22:52.29,etc and we can talk about it in

0:22:50.490,0:22:54.36,different ways but if that makes that

0:22:52.290,0:22:56.34,works with your material then yeah we'll

0:22:54.360,0:22:57.87,just okay so I don't have a rubric I

0:22:56.340,0:23:00.09,need to impose on this that's good

0:22:57.870,0:23:02.96,that's good I read one up yeah well a

0:23:00.090,0:23:06.03,bad structure is a good thing okay yeah

0:23:02.960,0:23:07.97,so and so what I'm going to ask you sort

0:23:06.030,0:23:10.74,of like how you worked in those

0:23:07.970,0:23:13.77,structures at beginning of your career

0:23:10.740,0:23:15.87,and maybe how those have changed so when

0:23:13.770,0:23:19.35,you first started writing you're sort of

0:23:15.870,0:23:21.60,more professional work what were your

0:23:19.350,0:23:24.15,kind of compositional prewriting

0:23:21.600,0:23:33.29,note-taking generative practices at that

0:23:24.150,0:23:38.42,point well this now gets to era and what

0:23:33.299,0:23:41.94,generation I am because I'm 57 so when I

0:23:38.429,0:23:44.66,started writing it was typewriters okay

0:23:41.940,0:23:49.95,you know it was I took a typewriter to

0:23:44.669,0:23:54.24,college yeah and it moved from you know

0:23:49.950,0:23:58.47,and I took typing in high school yes and

0:23:54.240,0:24:02.40,it was it went kind of quickly there

0:23:58.470,0:24:06.57,in the my little time capsule of when I

0:24:02.400,0:24:08.70,was sort of coming up from portable

0:24:06.570,0:24:11.94,typewriters and little cute cases that

0:24:08.700,0:24:17.53,were sort of like a big lunch box with a

0:24:11.940,0:24:23.57,little handle yeah - um increasingly

0:24:17.539,0:24:23.57,kind of complicated electric typewriters

0:24:24.049,0:24:33.45,- with all their weird accouterments

0:24:28.500,0:24:36.71,like carbon paper and whiteout or weird

0:24:33.450,0:24:38.25,then they would they started making

0:24:36.710,0:24:41.85,typewriters they actually had a

0:24:38.250,0:24:44.76,correcting tape in them with this was

0:24:41.850,0:24:46.53,like white and you would type over the

0:24:44.760,0:24:51.65,letter that you wanted to correct with

0:24:46.530,0:24:53.82,this white white chalky strip that was

0:24:51.659,0:24:55.86,in there in as part of the type right

0:24:53.820,0:25:00.59,before you had to like shove a weird

0:24:55.860,0:25:04.11,little piece yeah so all these kind of

0:25:00.590,0:25:08.65,very low-tech yeah

0:25:04.110,0:25:12.72,viewed in hindsight ways of dealing with

0:25:08.659,0:25:20.28,making text correcting text revising

0:25:12.720,0:25:23.22,text and also copying yeah text so and

0:25:20.280,0:25:25.74,then - the first sort of big I remember

0:25:23.220,0:25:29.25,when you know I first got a computer it

0:25:25.740,0:25:32.19,was sort of like you know I was ZZ Top

0:25:29.250,0:25:34.77,and I had a whole music system here oh

0:25:32.190,0:25:38.15,yeah big bulky thing and there were

0:25:34.770,0:25:42.92,things that went under the desk

0:25:38.150,0:25:46.55,so Bennett and and the printer had like

0:25:42.929,0:25:50.34,thee the print was really ugly looking

0:25:46.559,0:25:54.92,and dot dot matrix and it had these

0:25:50.340,0:26:00.29,weird strips with holes in it that you

0:25:54.929,0:26:04.78,tore yeah and it - you know this sleek

0:26:00.299,0:26:10.14,little through several iterations of

0:26:04.789,0:26:12.39,smaller better computers and printers

0:26:10.140,0:26:13.95,yeah and so I guess when

0:26:12.390,0:26:15.39,when it's when you were still working

0:26:13.950,0:26:18.63,with typewriters in the early computers

0:26:15.390,0:26:20.82,how how were you creating let's say the

0:26:18.630,0:26:22.65,poems I mean like were you starting in a

0:26:20.820,0:26:24.03,notebook and then moving and then typing

0:26:22.650,0:26:26.13,them out were you handwriting them and

0:26:24.030,0:26:28.29,then moving to the typewriter or back

0:26:26.130,0:26:30.96,when I first started writing poems when

0:26:28.290,0:26:35.19,I was a kid before I had access to a

0:26:30.960,0:26:36.92,typewriter or learned to type it was you

0:26:35.190,0:26:41.46,know spiral-bound

0:26:36.920,0:26:47.07,blind yeah notebooks uh-huh

0:26:41.460,0:26:51.06,and then it kind of moved to typing

0:26:47.070,0:26:53.94,things which you'd think would have made

0:26:51.060,0:26:58.95,me revise a lot and I did revise but I

0:26:53.940,0:27:02.73,love computers the the every time you

0:26:58.950,0:27:06.63,wanted to change a period yeah or move

0:27:02.730,0:27:08.52,text around you had to retype everything

0:27:06.630,0:27:11.58,and you were sometimes dealing with

0:27:08.520,0:27:14.58,these crappy kinds of paper like that

0:27:11.580,0:27:19.04,onion skins if it was erasable but it

0:27:14.580,0:27:24.36,was so like in and fragile and

0:27:19.040,0:27:27.27,weird-looking and tactically bizarre and

0:27:24.360,0:27:29.40,kind of see-through we made the poem

0:27:27.270,0:27:35.55,seem like they were really not

0:27:29.400,0:27:39.72,substantial oh um so do you near Deeley

0:27:35.550,0:27:41.94,and then so when you had it like an idea

0:27:39.720,0:27:44.96,for a poem you would go directly to your

0:27:41.940,0:27:54.15,typewriter and start typing usually I

0:27:44.960,0:27:57.26,think that I I think I would write in

0:27:54.150,0:28:00.41,notebooks and then at a certain point

0:27:57.260,0:28:07.49,transfer what I had to the typewriter

0:28:00.410,0:28:07.49,because the typewriter was something

0:28:07.550,0:28:12.84,what it isn't actually easy to revise on

0:28:11.190,0:28:15.30,a manual type I mean you have to roll

0:28:12.840,0:28:18.35,the thing out yeah and Mark it up you

0:28:15.300,0:28:21.90,there isn't really an efficient way of

0:28:18.350,0:28:23.67,marking things out or putting inserting

0:28:21.900,0:28:25.20,a list of possible words you might when

0:28:23.670,0:28:26.58,it is instead of the word choice that

0:28:25.200,0:28:28.65,you had

0:28:26.580,0:28:30.51,so I think I would work on it up to a

0:28:28.650,0:28:32.37,certain point and typing it was sort of

0:28:30.510,0:28:34.77,like oh this is kind of an official

0:28:32.370,0:28:36.09,draft I really want to okay so once you

0:28:34.770,0:28:37.86,hit that point and you were yeah

0:28:36.090,0:28:41.70,starting to write because it really I

0:28:37.860,0:28:45.57,think something now putting something on

0:28:41.700,0:28:47.73,a computer makes it ultimately flexible

0:28:45.570,0:28:50.52,yeah it was sort of the opposite with a

0:28:47.730,0:28:53.73,manual typewriter it wasn't set in stone

0:28:50.520,0:28:55.92,but it was sort of like typing it up and

0:28:53.730,0:28:58.32,you and your stand you're saying to that

0:28:55.920,0:29:00.39,once it was once you got to that sort of

0:28:58.320,0:29:02.30,typewriter state it didn't really

0:29:00.390,0:29:06.03,encourage that much revision because I

0:29:02.309,0:29:08.25,did and I have old things that are you

0:29:06.030,0:29:12.74,know type scripts with lots of markings

0:29:08.250,0:29:17.70,on them blah blah blah but it's just a

0:29:12.740,0:29:20.07,revision on a computer is kind of a one

0:29:17.700,0:29:22.62,step process in the sense that it stays

0:29:20.070,0:29:25.79,within that medium but in order to

0:29:22.620,0:29:27.78,revise on a typewriter you had to roll

0:29:25.799,0:29:29.70,it out yet to get a pen yet to get

0:29:27.780,0:29:34.29,whiteout maybe you have to get an eraser

0:29:29.700,0:29:39.24,and then you had input the changes on a

0:29:34.290,0:29:41.76,new clean so so you would try to make me

0:29:39.240,0:29:44.91,once you got to where you're doing that

0:29:41.760,0:29:48.00,how far along I think something up would

0:29:44.910,0:29:50.25,be like a milestone every so often when

0:29:48.000,0:29:52.79,you'd been through okay a few drafts to

0:29:50.250,0:29:55.55,see it typed up and to mark that up and

0:29:52.799,0:29:57.84,then to when did it start - when did you

0:29:55.559,0:30:00.57,start to work on computers and those

0:29:57.840,0:30:05.54,early computers today was it did you

0:30:00.570,0:30:08.91,feel like a drastic change Oh having

0:30:05.549,0:30:09.90,this big machine and figuring out how to

0:30:08.910,0:30:12.29,use it

0:30:09.900,0:30:17.05,figuring out what it all meant figuring

0:30:12.299,0:30:21.41,out what a word processor was on real

0:30:17.059,0:30:24.00,and it would have problems and getting

0:30:21.419,0:30:27.12,some dim concept of what an operating

0:30:24.000,0:30:30.48,system was it does different things

0:30:27.120,0:30:31.89,right some people and it really divided

0:30:30.480,0:30:35.16,the sheep from the goats because there

0:30:31.890,0:30:36.66,were writers I knew that they had the

0:30:35.160,0:30:40.60,kinds of minds

0:30:36.669,0:30:42.39,or still do that really worked well with

0:30:40.600,0:30:44.27,computer interface if that's even the

0:30:42.399,0:30:48.78,right yeah

0:30:44.279,0:30:50.40,vocabulary they just took to it and they

0:30:48.789,0:30:54.24,and that there were other people who

0:30:50.409,0:30:59.95,were always it was always mysterious to

0:30:54.249,0:31:03.66,them it always felt foreign and robotic

0:30:59.950,0:31:05.04,and bizarre and they preferred other

0:31:03.669,0:31:06.90,things they were just always awkward

0:31:05.049,0:31:10.26,with it are always needed a lot of help

0:31:06.909,0:31:12.10,when like an intern needed an

0:31:10.269,0:31:16.21,intermediary between them and their

0:31:12.100,0:31:18.19,computer no no eh these computers are a

0:31:16.210,0:31:21.85,particular thing and if you have the

0:31:18.190,0:31:25.02,kind of mind right that works well with

0:31:21.850,0:31:27.94,them you can just zoom and you can

0:31:25.029,0:31:30.82,device up and kids now younger people

0:31:27.940,0:31:32.25,now who are born into various stages of

0:31:30.820,0:31:36.24,well it's the most natural thing in the

0:31:32.259,0:31:39.66,world yeah you you know you get your

0:31:36.249,0:31:43.38,first iPhone when you're four months old

0:31:39.669,0:31:46.50,um it's you know it's a language that

0:31:43.389,0:31:48.87,they learn there it's a native language

0:31:46.509,0:31:52.23,for them but for some of us older people

0:31:48.879,0:31:58.38,it was you're lucky if you were the kind

0:31:52.239,0:32:00.03,of writer who and I know people who the

0:31:58.389,0:32:08.15,wonderful poetry teacher that I had at

0:32:00.039,0:32:12.48,Pitzer Burt Myers said that he liked the

0:32:08.159,0:32:22.74,the computer dub typewriter yeah the

0:32:12.489,0:32:24.24,feel the pace the sound of the keys it's

0:32:22.749,0:32:26.35,almost like a musical instrument for

0:32:24.249,0:32:30.94,some writers yeah thank you they kind of

0:32:26.350,0:32:36.29,play it but for you that was never what

0:32:30.940,0:32:39.30,I like is I can take a chunk of text and

0:32:36.299,0:32:42.97,move it up here and it doesn't take me

0:32:39.309,0:32:45.22,40 minutes to retype the whole damn

0:32:42.970,0:32:47.52,thing and if I don't like it I can try

0:32:45.220,0:32:50.02,it down here and if I want to print out

0:32:47.529,0:32:52.45,a copy of something as a

0:32:50.020,0:32:55.72,Rose poem and a copy of it with some

0:32:52.450,0:33:00.28,line breaks and look at them next to

0:32:55.720,0:33:06.01,each other I can do that in a flash all

0:33:00.280,0:33:08.86,that I couldn't be happier so then I'm

0:33:06.010,0:33:13.72,spending my time reading and writing and

0:33:08.860,0:33:14.97,revising and not spending my time oh now

0:33:13.720,0:33:18.34,I have to do the whole thing over again

0:33:14.970,0:33:20.14,yeah so I guess then when they did come

0:33:18.340,0:33:22.21,along you were on that spectrum of

0:33:20.140,0:33:25.87,people who took to it fairly you I can't

0:33:22.210,0:33:29.59,say that I'm techno great but but I like

0:33:25.870,0:33:31.69,I like computers I don't you don't you

0:33:29.590,0:33:33.28,didn't input or you didn't like I guess

0:33:31.690,0:33:35.38,employees were employed intermediary

0:33:33.280,0:33:37.90,between you and your computer you I have

0:33:35.380,0:33:41.68,friends who are like tech wizards who I

0:33:37.900,0:33:45.55,definitely know when I'm like how come

0:33:41.680,0:33:47.50,all my email is now being spit back into

0:33:45.550,0:33:50.08,my box that I already downloaded and I

0:33:47.500,0:33:52.45,have 695 pieces of email they just don't

0:33:50.080,0:33:55.45,you know I'm like help I do that all the

0:33:52.450,0:33:59.26,time right how do you make words you

0:33:55.450,0:34:01.48,know not turn everything purple or but

0:33:59.260,0:34:04.84,I'm probably in the middle I think of

0:34:01.480,0:34:07.09,the spectrum of I wish I was one of

0:34:04.840,0:34:10.39,those people who just understands

0:34:07.090,0:34:12.31,everything at all levels about and could

0:34:10.390,0:34:15.01,set up a website and knows about

0:34:12.310,0:34:19.45,programming and can fix my own computer

0:34:15.010,0:34:21.28,and speak the lingo but I'm attracted to

0:34:19.450,0:34:23.71,that and I'm interested in it and I like

0:34:21.280,0:34:27.19,to be more conversant but I can't say

0:34:23.710,0:34:31.50,that I'm great but I'm not the super

0:34:27.190,0:34:33.94,scared so like yeah I hate this thing

0:34:31.500,0:34:36.15,it's only going to do my I have four

0:34:33.940,0:34:38.77,manual things in the closet because

0:34:36.159,0:34:43.33,that's what I really prefer it I guess

0:34:38.770,0:34:45.25,so we and you could you pinpoint a time

0:34:43.330,0:34:49.06,frame when you started working with

0:34:45.250,0:34:51.94,computers I mean well I remember when I

0:34:49.060,0:34:53.95,was in college a guy who I'm still

0:34:51.940,0:34:57.16,friends with this wonderful guy named

0:34:53.950,0:35:01.69,Brian Tucker who's a visual artist and

0:34:57.160,0:35:03.94,also a very good art writer he was one

0:35:01.690,0:35:06.94,of those people who was like

0:35:03.940,0:35:10.11,the computer thing he was like it was

0:35:06.940,0:35:12.49,like made in the shade for him and he

0:35:10.119,0:35:14.34,would like go when we were in college

0:35:12.490,0:35:16.42,there was a computer there but it took

0:35:14.349,0:35:18.91,up a whole room right and he would like

0:35:16.420,0:35:24.70,go in there and make things and print

0:35:18.910,0:35:29.60,things out and so he but there was a

0:35:24.700,0:35:33.75,while between when I graduated from

0:35:29.609,0:35:36.94,college in the 70s and when computers

0:35:33.759,0:35:39.88,were sort of starting to make their way

0:35:36.940,0:35:46.75,into writers yeah lives like into their

0:35:39.880,0:35:50.82,home yeah right so I started probably it

0:35:46.750,0:35:53.10,would probably be the very beginning

0:35:50.829,0:35:56.61,user beginning of dating books maybe

0:35:53.109,0:36:00.57,would be my best guess yeah and I guess

0:35:56.619,0:36:02.44,when did you how long did it take you to

0:36:00.579,0:36:05.01,realize that you had the sort of

0:36:02.440,0:36:07.42,capabilities that you've been wanting

0:36:05.019,0:36:08.95,you didn't even know like the ability to

0:36:07.420,0:36:10.48,move things around I mean it was that

0:36:08.950,0:36:12.75,initial or did that take a couple

0:36:10.480,0:36:16.56,generations to where it felt really easy

0:36:12.759,0:36:22.55,to do all that sort of thing well some

0:36:16.569,0:36:27.51,things there were certain perks that

0:36:22.559,0:36:29.47,manifested pretty immediately like just

0:36:27.519,0:36:33.33,having a copy of a thing and being able

0:36:29.470,0:36:35.85,to print it out yeah that was that was

0:36:33.339,0:36:40.29,pretty easy right away that was like

0:36:35.859,0:36:43.72,this is way better and being able to

0:36:40.299,0:36:46.02,correct things and move them and change

0:36:43.720,0:36:49.32,them and that was immediate like that

0:36:46.029,0:36:51.91,was I mean those are things that

0:36:49.329,0:36:55.21,rudimentary computers if memory serves

0:36:51.910,0:36:58.63,were able to do yeah yeah copying

0:36:55.210,0:37:00.40,pasting yes you didn't have to like you

0:36:58.630,0:37:02.71,know be the best friend of the Xerox

0:37:00.400,0:37:04.96,machine always anymore right right away

0:37:02.710,0:37:06.64,that's a life improvement so what were

0:37:04.960,0:37:09.33,you using the Xerox machine if you

0:37:06.640,0:37:11.17,wanted to send work out this is pre

0:37:09.339,0:37:14.89,email right I mean actually this is

0:37:11.170,0:37:16.83,making you feel like no dinosaur antique

0:37:14.890,0:37:21.67,but that was inevitable

0:37:16.839,0:37:23.25,and you know so if you wanted to if you

0:37:21.670,0:37:24.84,wanted to apply for a grant if you

0:37:23.259,0:37:26.38,wanted to show somebody a copy of

0:37:24.849,0:37:28.26,something if you wanted to send somebody

0:37:26.380,0:37:30.51,a copy of something if you wanted to

0:37:28.269,0:37:32.92,send out a manuscript if you wanted to

0:37:30.519,0:37:36.72,send work to a magazine all of that

0:37:32.920,0:37:40.45,involved either carbon paper yuck

0:37:36.729,0:37:42.83,yeah or Xerox sitting right so then that

0:37:40.450,0:37:46.39,was that was kind of an early

0:37:42.839,0:37:53.92,organizational some sort of work there

0:37:46.390,0:37:55.59,and then so so I guess is there are

0:37:53.920,0:37:57.00,there any other so you have that sort of

0:37:55.599,0:37:58.98,beginning stage where you know in

0:37:57.009,0:38:01.83,computers this kind of Revelation are

0:37:58.989,0:38:04.02,there kind of stages between then and

0:38:01.839,0:38:09.35,now that you could delineate or is it

0:38:04.029,0:38:13.23,sort of a gradual every I mean it's

0:38:09.359,0:38:16.23,there are so many wonders as far as I'm

0:38:13.239,0:38:20.31,concerned and if I if I was more tech

0:38:16.239,0:38:23.07,savvy than I am I would be conversant

0:38:20.319,0:38:25.31,with even more wonders and it's not just

0:38:23.079,0:38:27.54,for writing although that may be your

0:38:25.319,0:38:30.13,topic of interest in data collection

0:38:27.549,0:38:32.28,here for teaching right it's

0:38:30.130,0:38:35.25,unbelievably helpful I'm going to just

0:38:32.289,0:38:39.24,make this so this doesn't we don't hear

0:38:35.259,0:38:42.13,a loud message from a telemarketer which

0:38:39.249,0:38:50.78,I'm so anxious to speak to valor just

0:38:42.130,0:38:55.65,have to wait so Stan I mean it's changed

0:38:50.789,0:38:58.65,teaching completely yeah with you know

0:38:55.650,0:39:02.03,PowerPoint email as a way of

0:38:58.650,0:39:05.04,distributing class materials or

0:39:02.039,0:39:07.63,communicating with students blah blah

0:39:05.049,0:39:11.31,blah blah and in terms of writing every

0:39:07.630,0:39:13.42,time there would be the smallness of

0:39:11.319,0:39:18.21,this the portability of this it's

0:39:13.420,0:39:21.51,different capabilities visual stuff

0:39:18.219,0:39:24.36,being able to put visual being able to

0:39:21.519,0:39:27.16,have access to all these typefaces

0:39:24.369,0:39:29.31,I mean it just looks better and better

0:39:27.160,0:39:31.65,right now it's wireless

0:39:29.319,0:39:38.19,if I don't have to plug everything into

0:39:31.650,0:39:42.43,yeah I mean to me be the blessings and

0:39:38.199,0:39:46.93,the bounty are just because it and I

0:39:42.430,0:39:51.67,feel I'm not for me I'm not something

0:39:46.930,0:39:53.68,that there's a loss yeah it's like that

0:39:51.670,0:39:56.14,there might be a downside in terms of

0:39:53.680,0:39:57.84,polluting the world with what you know

0:39:56.140,0:40:00.51,these things are made out of our own

0:39:57.849,0:40:03.26,Otto cycle and things like that and that

0:40:00.519,0:40:07.22,is a bad thing

0:40:03.269,0:40:13.25,capital B capital T but in terms of

0:40:07.229,0:40:20.21,making it easier to store send revise

0:40:13.259,0:40:23.44,read research communicate you know

0:40:20.219,0:40:25.56,what's not to like right in my view

0:40:23.440,0:40:28.23,right I mean and your poems have such a

0:40:25.569,0:40:30.57,large imaginative scope I'm wondering

0:40:28.239,0:40:31.74,was there time I mean like strolling

0:40:30.579,0:40:32.97,that in like when you're first using

0:40:31.749,0:40:34.23,computers and you know there's not so

0:40:32.979,0:40:36.64,much the Internet

0:40:34.239,0:40:39.84,how are you generating all those ideas

0:40:36.640,0:40:43.23,and material at that point dude

0:40:39.849,0:40:49.14,libraries libraries all right libraries

0:40:43.239,0:40:54.78,libraries libraries and you know old

0:40:49.140,0:40:58.90,used stores weird old books that I would

0:40:54.789,0:41:01.53,work out of or of magazines or um stuff

0:40:58.900,0:41:04.08,like that and as as the internet became

0:41:01.539,0:41:08.14,more of a sort of part of one's daily

0:41:04.089,0:41:10.71,life did that change I mean did I many

0:41:08.140,0:41:11.82,I'm yeah I still I still use libraries

0:41:10.719,0:41:18.69,you still you okay

0:41:11.829,0:41:21.67,and I still haunt the remaining dusty

0:41:18.699,0:41:26.34,old funky use yes

0:41:21.670,0:41:27.91,stores yeah but um even with libraries

0:41:26.349,0:41:32.01,now if I'm looking for something

0:41:27.910,0:41:35.04,specific I can look online right it just

0:41:32.019,0:41:37.93,saves time I don't you know I don't have

0:41:35.049,0:41:40.08,to trudge around to all the local

0:41:37.930,0:41:42.73,libraries looking to see if they have

0:41:40.089,0:41:45.34,any books on Marie Curie or

0:41:42.730,0:41:47.80,they have a particular title by

0:41:45.340,0:41:50.26,so-and-so I can see I can see if it's in

0:41:47.800,0:41:52.86,the library yeah I can find out what the

0:41:50.260,0:41:56.29,library how horses are I can talk to a

0:41:52.869,0:41:57.76,librarian if I need to so I guess well

0:41:56.290,0:41:58.96,how does that I just have the part of

0:41:57.760,0:42:01.39,the process how do you how do you go

0:41:58.960,0:42:05.10,from you know sort of browsing

0:42:01.390,0:42:06.76,serendipitously to like having a draft

0:42:05.109,0:42:12.01,of a poem and what's what's the process

0:42:06.760,0:42:17.85,there well I get ideas for poems and

0:42:12.010,0:42:23.32,sometimes they're phrases or sort of

0:42:17.850,0:42:27.81,topics or weird feelings or vocabularies

0:42:23.320,0:42:31.84,where I want to write a poem based on

0:42:27.810,0:42:35.73,the initial sort of generative impulses

0:42:31.840,0:42:39.28,oh this you know has to do with

0:42:35.730,0:42:41.41,hurricanes and my mother-in-law so I you

0:42:39.280,0:42:47.23,know what I mean or something like that

0:42:41.410,0:42:54.00,so and and I love research researches to

0:42:47.230,0:42:56.83,me such a rich poetic amazing

0:42:54.000,0:43:00.04,exploration and is full of the

0:42:56.830,0:43:01.57,unexpected yeah like in the this is

0:43:00.040,0:43:05.02,another thing that relates to sort of

0:43:01.570,0:43:07.99,digital stuff at least in my mind the

0:43:05.020,0:43:11.29,old what the old one of the only things

0:43:07.990,0:43:16.24,I miss about pre digital is card

0:43:11.290,0:43:19.90,catalogs because they coming through a

0:43:16.240,0:43:24.25,card catalog I would be taken on many

0:43:19.900,0:43:26.47,more weird tributaries then I get doing

0:43:24.250,0:43:32.29,a computer search in the library right

0:43:26.470,0:43:34.48,on whatever yeah um you know I'd be

0:43:32.290,0:43:35.71,looking up to the history of ferns or

0:43:34.480,0:43:37.75,something and I'd come across the

0:43:35.710,0:43:39.16,history of shock treatments and I'd be

0:43:37.750,0:43:42.19,like oh that's way more interesting

0:43:39.160,0:43:46.23,source but what do we got here and go

0:43:42.190,0:43:51.67,find that book or something um so that's

0:43:46.230,0:43:55.66,that I kind of regret the way computer

0:43:51.670,0:43:55.97,indexes are set up yeah it's actually a

0:43:55.660,0:43:59.15,little

0:43:55.970,0:44:05.57,harder to find things I think on the

0:43:59.150,0:44:07.25,topic but anyway um that yeah so I'm

0:44:05.570,0:44:08.72,talking about going off on tangents and

0:44:07.250,0:44:12.53,research and I just went off on it

0:44:08.720,0:44:14.81,handle but I guess one question I have

0:44:12.530,0:44:16.43,then is you know I mean research for

0:44:14.810,0:44:18.85,poems seems I could be different than

0:44:16.430,0:44:23.15,research for journalism piece it is it's

0:44:18.859,0:44:27.89,much more it smoothly its imaginative

0:44:23.150,0:44:33.47,research yeah in a way and I think the

0:44:27.890,0:44:36.83,research is done differently and also

0:44:33.470,0:44:40.28,Pacific has different objectives so you

0:44:36.830,0:44:43.97,kind of pursue it differently and you

0:44:40.280,0:44:47.15,can you sort of glean different things

0:44:43.970,0:44:49.16,from it in researching like for

0:44:47.150,0:44:53.48,journalism you're usually looking for

0:44:49.160,0:44:55.73,facts and sources and um different kinds

0:44:53.480,0:44:59.11,of information and where different kinds

0:44:55.730,0:45:01.67,of information are or what the scope of

0:44:59.119,0:45:05.00,an issue or subject is and with poems

0:45:01.670,0:45:10.49,it's sometimes it's really vocabulary

0:45:05.000,0:45:15.85,like a certain diction yeah or um bits

0:45:10.490,0:45:18.32,of color in a kind of structure of it so

0:45:15.859,0:45:22.64,and sometimes it's facts that are going

0:45:18.320,0:45:28.75,to get bent or distorted more rubbed up

0:45:22.640,0:45:32.15,against another set of facts or data or

0:45:28.750,0:45:33.47,vocabularies or made-up stuff if that

0:45:32.150,0:45:35.69,makes it no it does it makes a lot of

0:45:33.470,0:45:37.70,sense but and so I guess in comparison

0:45:35.690,0:45:39.68,then would you say that like for your

0:45:37.700,0:45:41.42,research through journalism research to

0:45:39.680,0:45:43.33,the computers really did that sort of

0:45:41.420,0:45:45.47,aids that I mean that sort of means

0:45:43.339,0:45:47.63,because it has a more specificity I

0:45:45.470,0:45:51.25,guess than it does but you're saying you

0:45:47.630,0:45:54.32,missed the sort of broad for poetic and

0:45:51.250,0:45:57.50,literary kind of research I definitely

0:45:54.320,0:46:01.42,missed the kind of strolling through the

0:45:57.500,0:46:04.76,card catalog in all the different little

0:46:01.420,0:46:06.53,blooming subjects that you would come

0:46:04.760,0:46:09.08,across although occasionally in doing

0:46:06.530,0:46:14.78,any kind of research even a very sort of

0:46:09.080,0:46:18.47,scholarly or fact-based project you

0:46:14.780,0:46:20.09,would come across something useful but

0:46:18.470,0:46:22.16,that wasn't something you were looking

0:46:20.090,0:46:23.60,for specifically that's something that

0:46:22.160,0:46:27.86,you didn't know was going to be there

0:46:23.600,0:46:30.77,okay so so so there's that whereas a

0:46:27.860,0:46:33.80,that would be serendipitous in kind of

0:46:30.770,0:46:37.10,journalistic or factual type research

0:46:33.800,0:46:39.56,and it would be totally the point yes it

0:46:37.100,0:46:45.95,is in more poetic or literary research

0:46:39.560,0:46:48.38,maybe when they both hey they both

0:46:45.950,0:46:51.23,partake I think of each other like

0:46:48.380,0:46:53.66,sometimes in doing sort of quote-unquote

0:46:51.230,0:46:56.48,poetic research if you're really just

0:46:53.660,0:46:59.33,like yeah but I need to know like five

0:46:56.480,0:47:01.70,things that bears actually eat for this

0:46:59.330,0:47:06.02,poem so I can pick one yeah that sounds

0:47:01.700,0:47:08.27,good you can find that yeah I guess so

0:47:06.020,0:47:10.58,in a sort of final question about the

0:47:08.270,0:47:12.50,sort of early stages generative stages

0:47:10.580,0:47:14.84,is there way is there any way that

0:47:12.500,0:47:16.43,you're working now that you that is new

0:47:14.840,0:47:17.75,that is like not different than the way

0:47:16.430,0:47:20.21,that you worked in the past I don't know

0:47:17.750,0:47:22.58,if the ease all this sort of ease of

0:47:20.210,0:47:24.26,printing and revising and or just sort

0:47:22.580,0:47:25.52,of like generating and the internet and

0:47:24.260,0:47:29.39,everything kind of being with you at all

0:47:25.520,0:47:31.73,times has that changed your ways of

0:47:29.390,0:47:35.78,making poems absolutely it absolutely

0:47:31.730,0:47:38.75,has I mean I definitely use I direct I

0:47:35.780,0:47:40.40,go to the library less yeah because

0:47:38.750,0:47:42.41,there's so many things I can access

0:47:40.400,0:47:46.19,online and I can print them out at home

0:47:42.410,0:47:51.26,right or parts of them I can depending

0:47:46.190,0:47:53.96,on what their security and parameters

0:47:51.260,0:47:56.96,are like I can sometimes lift a phrase I

0:47:53.960,0:47:59.99,want to use out of a website and put it

0:47:56.960,0:48:01.67,right into a poem right which is very

0:47:59.990,0:48:05.57,convenient and then tinker with it or

0:48:01.670,0:48:08.36,whatever yeah yeah there are so many

0:48:05.570,0:48:11.27,things I can grab images I can look at

0:48:08.360,0:48:14.30,images if I'm like I want to describe a

0:48:11.270,0:48:19.16,crows foot but what is a crow foot look

0:48:14.300,0:48:21.75,like yeah I can look at an image of a

0:48:19.160,0:48:24.59,yeah yeah

0:48:21.750,0:48:27.86,and then if I do that if I'm googling

0:48:24.599,0:48:30.09,that or looking at that it'll also come

0:48:27.869,0:48:31.77,up with like oh yeah crows foot also

0:48:30.090,0:48:33.48,means you know the lines around your

0:48:31.770,0:48:35.52,eyes and they'll show me images of that

0:48:33.480,0:48:38.46,maybe that'll send me somewhere in the

0:48:35.520,0:48:42.03,poem so there's a type of serendipity in

0:48:38.460,0:48:48.11,that I guess absolute sure yeah sure

0:48:42.030,0:48:52.50,yeah um yeah but I mean in poems as you

0:48:48.119,0:48:54.21,well know yeah they the pun is is often

0:48:52.500,0:48:58.77,a welcome fellow with me through my

0:48:54.210,0:49:00.99,world yeah I'm sort of interested

0:48:58.770,0:49:03.21,personally like in that middle period

0:49:00.990,0:49:05.88,like the period let's say before Google

0:49:03.210,0:49:08.55,let's say like late 90s yes I mean like

0:49:05.880,0:49:10.41,do you remember like what the computer

0:49:08.550,0:49:13.61,use was like then I mean do you feel it

0:49:10.410,0:49:16.26,was like a limited kind of expression of

0:49:13.619,0:49:17.82,itself for you or we I mean it was that

0:49:16.260,0:49:19.71,still like kind of you were still using

0:49:17.820,0:49:22.02,the library primarily anything you know

0:49:19.710,0:49:24.86,and what it wasn't it it was kept out

0:49:22.020,0:49:29.08,like a kind of transitional time like

0:49:24.869,0:49:38.70,using both getting comfortable with

0:49:29.089,0:49:44.28,email because also doing journalism that

0:49:38.700,0:49:48.08,was a big thing like you know turning in

0:49:44.280,0:49:50.16,things that way yeah so that was the

0:49:48.089,0:49:53.94,cheese yeah that's good big big big

0:49:50.160,0:49:58.08,difference yeah and doing edits that way

0:49:53.940,0:50:00.63,oh yeah and going back and forth so you

0:49:58.080,0:50:03.03,didn't have to much quicker yeah like

0:50:00.630,0:50:08.09,like almost the whole time that I worked

0:50:03.030,0:50:10.83,at art form it was like well at the

0:50:08.099,0:50:13.77,beginning it was like over the phone you

0:50:10.830,0:50:15.83,know blah blah blah and then it would be

0:50:13.770,0:50:17.84,like somebody would mark something up

0:50:15.839,0:50:23.19,and send it to you over email and then

0:50:17.849,0:50:25.10,you'd go argue what is over but you

0:50:23.190,0:50:29.09,wouldn't be sitting there over the phone

0:50:25.109,0:50:31.98,going okay in paragraph three about the

0:50:29.099,0:50:35.59,middle yeah well this sentence this

0:50:31.980,0:50:37.55,worried you know that means yes it again

0:50:35.599,0:50:40.04,making things much more efficient

0:50:37.559,0:50:43.89,speeding things up making it so that you

0:50:40.049,0:50:46.98,could and also it was a lot about for me

0:50:43.890,0:50:52.34,yeah and I don't think I was alone in

0:50:46.980,0:50:59.46,this a lot about learning curve figuring

0:50:52.349,0:51:01.31,out how to use the computer what you

0:50:59.460,0:51:04.38,could do with it graphically also with

0:51:01.319,0:51:06.00,poems because suddenly you know on the

0:51:04.380,0:51:07.07,typewriter and on the early computers

0:51:06.000,0:51:08.78,you can put you couldn't play with

0:51:07.079,0:51:11.69,typeface you couldn't play with type

0:51:08.789,0:51:16.07,size you couldn't really people who

0:51:11.690,0:51:20.60,wanted to make concrete poetry or poetry

0:51:16.079,0:51:22.20,that you know yeah yeah they really

0:51:20.609,0:51:25.92,worked hard to do you know all those

0:51:22.200,0:51:30.72,guys back in the day they really worked

0:51:25.920,0:51:34.23,hard to get that written and then make

0:51:30.720,0:51:37.68,sure that it went into print yeah as the

0:51:34.230,0:51:39.42,artistic graphic on the page creation

0:51:37.680,0:51:40.98,that they wanted to make I know they

0:51:39.420,0:51:42.48,would have loved the universe they

0:51:40.980,0:51:44.19,would've loved like having I like to

0:51:42.480,0:51:47.36,think that those guys like Apollinaire

0:51:44.190,0:51:49.85,yeah would have been like oh I was at I

0:51:47.369,0:51:51.21,bored no I think I think Marjorie

0:51:49.859,0:51:53.46,Karloff is something about that he'd be

0:51:51.210,0:51:56.01,like why were my dad you know everybody

0:51:53.460,0:51:58.23,was there and then I mean has it come

0:51:56.010,0:52:00.21,back as that way I feel like I had an

0:51:58.230,0:52:02.54,express sort of like ability has in some

0:52:00.210,0:52:04.31,ways I mean this is a site uh but just

0:52:02.549,0:52:05.73,hasn't expressed itself in ways that I

0:52:04.319,0:52:07.17,mean there's definitely big toe and like

0:52:05.730,0:52:09.42,a lot of interesting stuff but it hasn't

0:52:07.170,0:52:12.27,gone to where maybe if there's no

0:52:09.420,0:52:13.03,movements or anything I think do you

0:52:12.270,0:52:18.08,want

0:52:13.039,0:52:20.02,there is some sort of graphically and

0:52:18.089,0:52:22.77,there's all that you know the words

0:52:20.029,0:52:25.74,cloud or Wordle where you could have

0:52:22.770,0:52:29.93,interesting just and and then there's

0:52:25.740,0:52:35.06,also people who are a lot using

0:52:29.930,0:52:40.65,different internet or research functions

0:52:35.069,0:52:44.03,as as kind of theme or structure or kind

0:52:40.650,0:52:47.22,of concept like kind of conceptual

0:52:44.039,0:52:49.23,poetry that's work yes right in all it

0:52:47.220,0:52:51.33,sort of grandchildren right

0:52:49.230,0:52:54.39,yeah absolutely no I know those are

0:52:51.330,0:52:57.36,definitely fascinating would you you

0:52:54.390,0:52:59.28,said you mentioned the tech faces and

0:52:57.360,0:53:04.56,using battery did that influence your

0:52:59.280,0:53:09.15,work well a little because I like to do

0:53:04.560,0:53:12.87,you know what sometimes gets called you

0:53:09.150,0:53:15.39,know multifocal mmm-hmm stuff so and I

0:53:12.870,0:53:18.36,have a weird fondness for italics I

0:53:15.390,0:53:20.76,always have had so what I you can

0:53:18.360,0:53:24.42,indicate different speakers different

0:53:20.760,0:53:26.19,voices different you know just with you

0:53:24.420,0:53:30.71,know I didn't used to be able to use

0:53:26.190,0:53:30.71,italics mixing bold make things bigger

0:53:31.070,0:53:42.08,you know make different columns yeah

0:53:35.970,0:53:45.99,suddenly you're like a you know you have

0:53:42.080,0:53:47.52,yeah exec did you ever have those sort

0:53:45.990,0:53:49.32,of inclinations when when you were

0:53:47.520,0:53:50.55,working with typewriters or in the early

0:53:49.320,0:53:52.11,days of the days of computers would you

0:53:50.550,0:53:54.75,were you like kind of oh I really like

0:53:52.110,0:53:57.75,this to look like that a little bit yeah

0:53:54.750,0:53:59.16,mostly because I wanted to use italics I

0:53:57.750,0:54:01.32,mean I'm not one of those people who was

0:53:59.160,0:54:03.33,I guess I wanted all over the page and I

0:54:01.320,0:54:05.40,want you know it coming down like rain

0:54:03.330,0:54:08.52,and I want to little exploding letters

0:54:05.400,0:54:10.83,here and not know yeah super into that

0:54:08.520,0:54:13.74,but there were small things I yeah

0:54:10.830,0:54:16.98,wanted to do and now you know not only

0:54:13.740,0:54:20.52,can you do them yeah but you can try 1,
0:54:16.980,0:54:22.95,different typefaces errs sizes all right

0:54:20.520,0:54:25.38,you can make it a color or you can write

0:54:22.950,0:54:29.22,and you find what part of that process

0:54:25.380,0:54:30.81,for you it mean like in what sort of the

0:54:29.220,0:54:32.88,progression where it is the sort of

0:54:30.810,0:54:34.56,using the different typefaces or playing

0:54:32.880,0:54:37.08,around happen does it happen more in the

0:54:34.560,0:54:38.43,early stages or like are you like maybe

0:54:37.080,0:54:45.30,in a more later revision stage you're

0:54:38.430,0:54:50.04,like movie but mostly later cuz I don't

0:54:45.300,0:54:52.86,usually stuff the need for that the

0:54:50.040,0:54:55.29,poems alleged need for that kind of

0:54:52.860,0:54:57.33,evolved as the poem evolves I don't

0:54:55.290,0:54:59.43,often start out saying oh this is going

0:54:57.330,0:55:01.70,to be about someone who has Alzheimer's

0:54:59.430,0:55:03.35,so there's her voice and then

0:55:01.700,0:55:05.33,there's the voice of the doctors and

0:55:03.350,0:55:07.04,then here's the voice of ya the

0:55:05.330,0:55:08.96,daughters like it so I'm going to need

0:55:07.040,0:55:10.28,at least three different typefaces or

0:55:08.960,0:55:11.66,they're going to need to be spatially

0:55:10.280,0:55:13.88,differentiated or blah blah blah but

0:55:11.660,0:55:19.82,that might evolve as I'm writing the

0:55:13.880,0:55:21.47,poem okay so I guess so now we'll move

0:55:19.820,0:55:25.40,kind of more specifically to revision

0:55:21.470,0:55:27.80,but when you were first starting to

0:55:25.400,0:55:29.30,write what were your sort of typical

0:55:27.800,0:55:31.97,revision practices just like

0:55:29.300,0:55:34.01,nitty-gritty how did it work you did you

0:55:31.970,0:55:36.47,sounds like you move from notebook

0:55:34.010,0:55:38.36,usually to a typewritten thing make some

0:55:36.470,0:55:43.94,changes in every sort of stage was

0:55:38.360,0:55:47.84,another type typed out piece kind of and

0:55:43.940,0:55:50.66,I actually especially after a while I

0:55:47.840,0:55:54.98,did now it does make me remember things

0:55:50.660,0:55:59.84,um I did a lot of cutting with scissors

0:55:54.980,0:56:02.75,and taping together with scotch tape I

0:55:59.840,0:56:06.23,did more and more and more of that so

0:56:02.750,0:56:08.12,you can't believe how happy I was you

0:56:06.230,0:56:09.80,know you lose pieces or the wind would

0:56:08.120,0:56:12.50,blow the way or the dog would eat the

0:56:09.800,0:56:14.63,nurse you know what I mean yeah and it

0:56:12.500,0:56:16.43,was just like and then if you tried to

0:56:14.630,0:56:19.19,Xerox something that was all like that

0:56:16.430,0:56:21.32,that would be these big gross lines on

0:56:19.190,0:56:24.32,it and it would just look like yeah

0:56:21.320,0:56:26.87,we're given the original cut and paste

0:56:24.320,0:56:31.64,really well no cut and paste is called

0:56:26.870,0:56:35.36,that for a reason so I I just couldn't

0:56:31.640,0:56:37.40,have been and I'm pretty clumsy in any

0:56:35.360,0:56:40.85,way I'm not a good like visual artist

0:56:37.400,0:56:42.89,that way so yeah to not have to spend

0:56:40.850,0:56:46.07,the time to not have to look for the

0:56:42.890,0:56:50.51,scissors to not be screwing around with

0:56:46.070,0:56:53.48,tape and glue and to be able to flip it

0:56:50.510,0:56:56.15,back if it didn't look good that way try

0:56:53.480,0:57:03.80,it another way make three versions and

0:56:56.150,0:57:06.05,look into it deeply so then in terms of

0:57:03.800,0:57:07.73,your revision sort of the cut and pasted

0:57:06.050,0:57:09.53,the copy and patience of rearranging has

0:57:07.730,0:57:14.09,always been a pretty fundamental to your

0:57:09.530,0:57:15.23,practice once I started to realize that

0:57:14.090,0:57:17.48,as

0:57:15.230,0:57:19.36,the late grade David Foster Wallace and

0:57:17.480,0:57:24.94,many other people have said that writing

0:57:19.369,0:57:29.66,is revision all the way through yeah

0:57:24.940,0:57:34.64,yeah but you know it for me it is I

0:57:29.660,0:57:37.28,don't things change a lot and when you I

0:57:34.640,0:57:39.44,often you know first start working on

0:57:37.280,0:57:42.61,something not that I ever know what I'm

0:57:39.440,0:57:48.43,doing but it's really groping and trying

0:57:42.619,0:57:50.48,things and additive and then you get to

0:57:48.430,0:57:54.79,parts of revision that are more

0:57:50.480,0:57:56.96,subtractive and then you kind of go back

0:57:54.799,0:57:59.32,and forth and then you get to a certain

0:57:56.960,0:58:01.06,point where oh now it actually seems

0:57:59.329,0:58:05.50,like it's turning into something so what

0:58:01.069,0:58:11.39,are the what are the new sort of

0:58:05.500,0:58:14.27,requirements or needs for this new path

0:58:11.390,0:58:17.08,that it's taking so would you say

0:58:14.270,0:58:18.17,between those sort of types of revisions

0:58:17.089,0:58:20.90,if you would say like additive

0:58:18.170,0:58:23.99,subtractive and may be substituted and

0:58:20.900,0:58:26.99,and yeah you have a prior and research

0:58:23.990,0:58:29.72,is definitely pulling things other

0:58:26.990,0:58:32.15,elements once it starts to take shape

0:58:29.720,0:58:36.64,you're like oh okay this isn't isn't

0:58:32.150,0:58:42.55,about autopsies it's about you know yeah

0:58:36.640,0:58:45.55,my feet my feet get her alive so

0:58:42.559,0:58:49.00,suddenly you know then it's like oh okay

0:58:45.559,0:58:52.36,then yeah then I'm suddenly looking at

0:58:49.000,0:58:55.46,podiatrist magazine okay

0:58:52.369,0:58:57.23,but in terms of is there as sort of is

0:58:55.460,0:58:59.39,their primary mode that you go to or you

0:58:57.230,0:59:02.66,see that you use each sort of all over

0:58:59.390,0:59:07.25,all over the place is my problem in life

0:59:02.660,0:59:09.31,and yes I would say and then I guess

0:59:07.250,0:59:11.39,when did this kind of writing his

0:59:09.319,0:59:13.46,revision realization start to really

0:59:11.390,0:59:15.79,influence your own practice with it from

0:59:13.460,0:59:20.59,the beginning or natee certainly at some

0:59:15.799,0:59:23.63,point when I was you know a kid and when

0:59:20.599,0:59:25.70,I was in junior high and high school I

0:59:23.630,0:59:28.04,was you know laboring under the

0:59:25.700,0:59:33.59,misapprehension which is a common one

0:59:28.040,0:59:40.43,that you know ah how six opened yourself

0:59:33.590,0:59:41.93,you know huh um mustn't touch it it just

0:59:40.430,0:59:45.20,kind of like a try

0:59:41.930,0:59:48.59,yes but this is not the case that we not

0:59:45.200,0:59:52.55,with me right um so once I got into

0:59:48.590,0:59:54.23,college I realized oh you know you work

0:59:52.550,0:59:55.52,on this stuff and you think about it and

0:59:54.230,0:59:57.59,maybe you show it to people who you

0:59:55.520,0:59:58.97,think are smart or interested in the

0:59:57.590,1:00:01.70,topic and they might have a suggestion

0:59:58.970,1:00:03.14,or you work on it and then you read some

1:00:01.700,1:00:05.60,more and you see oh look what that

1:00:03.140,1:00:08.09,person did this could solve my problem

1:00:05.600,1:00:11.12,here yeah and that it's just layers and

1:00:08.090,1:00:13.10,layers and layers and layers getting to

1:00:11.120,1:00:17.20,what this thing might be and then trying

1:00:13.100,1:00:22.13,to work on the thing and make it into

1:00:17.200,1:00:28.79,something that can work right um that

1:00:22.130,1:00:31.49,it's all just writing is revision you're

1:00:28.790,1:00:34.19,constantly making yeah this is you know

1:00:31.490,1:00:36.68,sort of like perception of revision and

1:00:34.190,1:00:41.99,filtering and choices and yeah otherwise

1:00:36.680,1:00:43.64,it's ya know and you're nuts and you

1:00:41.990,1:00:46.52,can't attend to anything and it's all

1:00:43.640,1:00:48.77,and also you as you get older I think

1:00:46.520,1:00:52.10,you realize that every poem doesn't have

1:00:48.770,1:00:54.08,to contain every single thought feeling

1:00:52.100,1:00:57.64,and reaction you've ever had in your

1:00:54.080,1:01:00.80,life that actually you can get to the

1:00:57.640,1:01:02.14,universal which can be specific right

1:01:00.800,1:01:06.29,great

1:01:02.140,1:01:09.14,maybe you're lucky do you mean like so

1:01:06.290,1:01:12.74,when you go to a piece to revise it do

1:01:09.140,1:01:14.99,you have any intentions in mind I mean

1:01:12.740,1:01:18.20,there's I sure and sometimes sometimes

1:01:14.990,1:01:21.50,some of them survive yeah the process

1:01:18.200,1:01:24.59,and sometimes some of them were you know

1:01:21.500,1:01:27.23,things that end up leading to other

1:01:24.590,1:01:29.60,things that end up getting discarded and

1:01:27.230,1:01:31.46,sometimes some of them are red herrings

1:01:29.600,1:01:33.68,and the thing doesn't end up going

1:01:31.460,1:01:36.08,anywhere so it either goes in the trash

1:01:33.680,1:01:37.85,or one line from it gets cannibalized

1:01:36.080,1:01:39.98,out and goes to something else and the

1:01:37.850,1:01:40.34,rest of it goes in the trash so and then

1:01:39.980,1:01:43.67,like

1:01:40.340,1:01:45.56,in terms of kind of what drives your

1:01:43.670,1:01:47.60,revisions are they usually is it sort of

1:01:45.560,1:01:49.19,like do you have a phrase like sound or

1:01:47.600,1:01:52.55,structure or meaning or is it sort of a

1:01:49.190,1:01:55.87,combination hopefully I hope and pray

1:01:52.550,1:01:58.94,that it's all those things and sometimes

1:01:55.870,1:02:02.48,you're working on some people have a

1:01:58.940,1:02:04.19,good head you talked to Michael Ryan he

1:02:02.480,1:02:08.20,had such a good head for all those

1:02:04.190,1:02:14.42,things right for the kind of emotional

1:02:08.200,1:02:25.22,content for form yeah for sound and

1:02:14.420,1:02:29.39,music and beat all of that I'm not so

1:02:25.220,1:02:31.64,wonderful I sometimes a set of a period

1:02:29.390,1:02:34.10,of revisions will be like this is just

1:02:31.640,1:02:36.80,about trying to dig out the idea and

1:02:34.100,1:02:39.65,then after it feels like some of that is

1:02:36.800,1:02:43.04,maybe coming out that sometimes I will

1:02:39.650,1:02:47.42,have to be like okay you really have to

1:02:43.040,1:02:51.56,be hearing this now and work on the

1:02:47.420,1:02:52.88,sound because yeah yeah so it kind of

1:02:51.560,1:02:54.80,goes is you sort of like

1:02:52.880,1:02:56.72,compartmentalize sometimes yeah and then

1:02:54.800,1:03:02.84,hopefully once it really gets going

1:02:56.720,1:03:08.09,you're able to kind of see smell hear

1:03:02.840,1:03:09.98,feel taste what's what's going on or or

1:03:08.090,1:03:11.21,sometimes it'll be like work on

1:03:09.980,1:03:13.58,something for quite a while and then be

1:03:11.210,1:03:18.02,like you know it might help shape this

1:03:13.580,1:03:21.59,for it to being quatrains or is this

1:03:18.020,1:03:23.39,really a prose poem yeah yeah that's

1:03:21.590,1:03:25.19,always an interesting question right or

1:03:23.390,1:03:28.60,since this is about a couple who hates

1:03:25.190,1:03:28.60,each other how about couplets

1:03:29.260,1:03:38.12,so is there did you learn how to revise

1:03:34.700,1:03:40.94,any we teach you Dennis Cooper taught me

1:03:38.120,1:03:42.08,a lot and being in some workshops I mean

1:03:40.940,1:03:44.63,what that's one of the things that

1:03:42.080,1:03:46.34,workshops is supposed to teach you I

1:03:44.630,1:03:48.14,mean one of the things that workshops

1:03:46.340,1:03:50.55,usually teaches you is how to survive

1:03:48.140,1:03:55.98,workshop right right and how to

1:03:50.550,1:03:58.85,in them yeah but I think things that

1:03:55.980,1:04:01.83,have taught me about revision are

1:03:58.850,1:04:06.75,showing work to other people being in

1:04:01.830,1:04:08.91,workshops reading and reading literature

1:04:06.750,1:04:14.13,and also sometimes reading craft stuff

1:04:08.910,1:04:17.04,yeah and going to lectures talking to

1:04:14.130,1:04:21.86,people and I feel like I learn a lot

1:04:17.040,1:04:26.91,from teaching okay that's one of the

1:04:21.860,1:04:29.19,real unbelievable benefits of teaching I

1:04:26.910,1:04:31.38,learn a lot from reading students work I

1:04:29.190,1:04:33.75,learn a lot from being in workshop with

1:04:31.380,1:04:37.80,them yeah seeing how they do it yeah

1:04:33.750,1:04:41.25,just being part of it yeah seeing what

1:04:37.800,1:04:43.98,they're reading incredibly helpful and

1:04:41.250,1:04:47.27,then I've had a few you know Dennis

1:04:43.980,1:04:50.10,Cooper was an unbelievable mentor and

1:04:47.270,1:04:51.84,and some other teachers I've had for you

1:04:50.100,1:04:54.87,know that when you have a writing

1:04:51.840,1:04:57.48,teacher usually that's when you get down

1:04:54.870,1:05:01.38,to it yeah they can help you learn about

1:04:57.480,1:05:04.08,your strengths right they can help you

1:05:01.380,1:05:10.71,work on your process and maybe be less

1:05:04.080,1:05:12.66,scared yeah and they can maybe help you

1:05:10.710,1:05:16.23,figure out how to navigate the literary

1:05:12.660,1:05:18.87,world and what kinds of writers and

1:05:16.230,1:05:20.55,stuff you might like yeah open up stuff

1:05:18.870,1:05:23.97,like that for you but I think they end

1:05:20.550,1:05:27.66,up what maybe they most help you with

1:05:23.970,1:05:29.73,often is revision like a really good

1:05:27.660,1:05:32.13,like Dennis Cooper was such a great

1:05:29.730,1:05:35.37,mentor to me that I can still sometimes

1:05:32.130,1:05:41.52,hear him in my head do you I mean like

1:05:35.370,1:05:44.28,what are you here you know why are you

1:05:41.520,1:05:47.94,using this word that's not tight enough

1:05:44.280,1:05:50.19,or or just things that he would I mean

1:05:47.940,1:05:52.22,he wants one time he just said to me and

1:05:50.190,1:05:54.63,we'll ask people have said this in other

1:05:52.220,1:05:57.45,ways I'm sure but he was like you have

1:05:54.630,1:06:00.57,to cultivate your obsessions and I was

1:05:57.450,1:06:03.21,always a little ashamed of my obsession

1:06:00.570,1:06:05.40,but he was the opposite yeah

1:06:03.210,1:06:07.50,his obsessions were like he was like art

1:06:05.400,1:06:09.21,is our religion you have to cult it you

1:06:07.500,1:06:12.15,know and he wasn't like preaching it was

1:06:09.210,1:06:14.52,just kind of calmly quietly said it was

1:06:12.150,1:06:19.58,what he taught yeah but these were new

1:06:14.520,1:06:24.45,ideas to me right and rocked my world

1:06:19.580,1:06:26.33,yeah in a big way I was like oh I'm

1:06:24.450,1:06:28.05,obsessed with drowning I can instead of

1:06:26.339,1:06:30.59,thinking that I just should go to the

1:06:28.050,1:06:32.73,doctor I can actually read things about

1:06:30.599,1:06:34.26,it and write things that that didn't

1:06:32.730,1:06:36.90,pursue it or I'm obsessed with like

1:06:34.260,1:06:38.67,ancient Egyptian Toulouse and some you

1:06:36.900,1:06:42.11,know name you know it's just kind of a

1:06:38.670,1:06:45.05,freedom right yeah freedom Anna I hate

1:06:42.119,1:06:49.32,this word but you know a permission yeah

1:06:45.050,1:06:51.59,like no that's what Arendt's do right we

1:06:49.320,1:06:53.67,don't know no no well some people seem

1:06:51.599,1:06:55.80,to know what instinct Chui yes that some

1:06:53.670,1:06:57.93,people really do and there are other

1:06:55.800,1:07:00.27,more timid ones of us that need somebody

1:06:57.930,1:07:03.42,to kind of light a fire under them and

1:07:00.270,1:07:06.66,he he kind of did that and a few other

1:07:03.420,1:07:09.99,people did that for me and so I guess

1:07:06.660,1:07:11.70,one who did throughout this kind of

1:07:09.990,1:07:13.68,through throughout your writing has have

1:07:11.700,1:07:15.27,other people played roles like I mean he

1:07:13.680,1:07:16.89,seems to play a role in teaching you how

1:07:15.270,1:07:19.92,to revise of other people play kind of

1:07:16.890,1:07:29.28,more specific roles in the revision

1:07:19.920,1:07:32.22,process for you um well I mean I didn't

1:07:29.280,1:07:34.83,study writing I unfortunately you know I

1:07:32.220,1:07:36.90,was a psych major undergrad and then

1:07:34.830,1:07:40.16,when I was much older I went to a low

1:07:36.900,1:07:44.58,residency writing program in nonfiction

1:07:40.160,1:07:50.36,and all the teachers I had there were

1:07:44.580,1:07:53.19,really great at you know taking your

1:07:50.369,1:07:54.50,copy and going over it and yeah showing

1:07:53.190,1:07:58.14,you you know uh-huh

1:07:54.500,1:08:00.20,you know this is you know you're

1:07:58.140,1:08:02.60,avoiding something here or this is

1:08:00.200,1:08:04.77,because it wasn't we just like out out

1:08:02.609,1:08:08.09,out out it would be like I want to know

1:08:04.770,1:08:13.32,more about this yeah or I'm so curious

1:08:08.099,1:08:15.20,about this or you know the things that

1:08:13.320,1:08:17.45,that undercurrents they

1:08:15.200,1:08:21.71,that haven't been mined out of it yet or

1:08:17.450,1:08:24.44,that because it's you your and and your

1:08:21.710,1:08:26.90,kind of you know deep-sea fishing in

1:08:24.440,1:08:30.41,your unconscious or subconscious in a

1:08:26.900,1:08:32.48,way that you might need another person

1:08:30.410,1:08:34.10,to eat just say this is excessive or

1:08:32.480,1:08:36.71,this isn't the most interesting thing or

1:08:34.100,1:08:38.23,you think this is about you know Abraham

1:08:36.710,1:08:40.96,Lincoln but it's really about you

1:08:38.239,1:08:43.00,wanting to have a baby so get real to

1:08:40.969,1:08:45.08,yourself if you know what I mean yeah

1:08:43.009,1:08:47.48,and sometimes people are wrong but

1:08:45.080,1:08:51.71,sometimes you're like oh god right

1:08:47.480,1:08:54.52,that's that oh yeah you're right

1:08:51.710,1:08:55.96,yeah and you still I mean you have that

1:08:54.529,1:09:00.52,do you have those relationships now with

1:08:55.969,1:09:01.21,your poetry or um I try to do it for

1:09:00.529,1:09:06.41,myself

1:09:01.219,1:09:10.73,mm-hmm and there are people I show

1:09:06.410,1:09:12.17,things to now and again but you know I

1:09:10.730,1:09:14.54,don't sound like Grandma Moses or

1:09:12.170,1:09:16.25,anything but I sit for me it seems like

1:09:14.540,1:09:19.56,it gets a little harder when you get

1:09:16.250,1:09:24.68,older because everyone is so busy yeah

1:09:19.569,1:09:26.48,and you know I can't ask my students to

1:09:24.680,1:09:27.68,look at my work because it's supposed to

1:09:26.480,1:09:29.66,be going the other way around although

1:09:27.680,1:09:33.31,I'd like to I mean a lot of them are

1:09:29.660,1:09:36.62,most all of them are really kind of

1:09:33.319,1:09:39.04,smart and brilliant engine you know it

1:09:36.620,1:09:41.48,would be great but that is not specific

1:09:39.049,1:09:43.75,is not fair and that's so awesome

1:09:41.480,1:09:48.79,different worship yes it's all about

1:09:43.759,1:09:52.81,being today you know so I have a few

1:09:48.799,1:09:57.38,people who I try not to tap very often

1:09:52.819,1:10:00.56,right and much later in the process and

1:09:57.380,1:10:03.11,I I try really hard to do it for myself

1:10:00.560,1:10:10.52,and to come back to things multiple

1:10:03.110,1:10:12.38,times from multiple angles yeah you know

1:10:10.520,1:10:15.89,when you're younger and you have a lot

1:10:12.380,1:10:17.33,usually more friends and you're all

1:10:15.890,1:10:18.95,young and you have a little bit more

1:10:17.330,1:10:22.55,time and maybe if people aren't locked

1:10:18.950,1:10:24.59,into jobs their families and you're all

1:10:22.550,1:10:27.02,artists and writers together coming up

1:10:24.590,1:10:27.60,and then there's some winnowing yeah at

1:10:27.020,1:10:29.37,least

1:10:27.600,1:10:33.72,my spirits probably other people have a

1:10:29.370,1:10:35.73,different experience and so some people

1:10:33.720,1:10:38.64,stop doing in and do something else

1:10:35.730,1:10:40.71,which is cool some people get very

1:10:38.640,1:10:44.87,busier you lose touch with them and then

1:10:40.710,1:10:47.16,a lot of people have jobs and lives that

1:10:44.870,1:10:49.14,you know they're already reading their

1:10:47.160,1:10:52.35,students work and trying to make a

1:10:49.140,1:10:54.44,living and trying to write keep their

1:10:52.350,1:10:57.45,life together and do their own work so

1:10:54.440,1:10:59.96,you know you're like hey here's 60 pages

1:10:57.450,1:11:03.54,of my poems on top of your busy

1:10:59.960,1:11:05.27,multitasking lives have fun and try to

1:11:03.540,1:11:09.21,get back to me within the next two days

1:11:05.270,1:11:13.61,it's very hard or do it great ya know

1:11:09.210,1:11:16.20,that is a definitely one of the things

1:11:13.610,1:11:18.57,and then I guess in terms of when they

1:11:16.200,1:11:20.10,get when you use it to this process

1:11:18.570,1:11:22.44,where you're putting together a book and

1:11:20.100,1:11:24.72,when I'm kind of a third-stage I guess I

1:11:22.440,1:11:26.40,mean how do you go about I mean I guess

1:11:24.720,1:11:28.32,it's a revision process there to putting

1:11:26.400,1:11:29.94,the collections together what it order

1:11:28.320,1:11:33.03,or what are your sort of drives

1:11:29.940,1:11:35.91,intentions and has that changed over the

1:11:33.030,1:11:37.77,course of your career - well it's

1:11:35.910,1:11:39.33,different with different book okay

1:11:37.770,1:11:47.27,because they're different animals right

1:11:39.330,1:11:51.54,right yeah more or less yeah for me if

1:11:47.270,1:11:56.40,it's a book of poems some books of poems

1:11:51.540,1:12:00.54,are sort of like a scrapbook or a

1:11:56.400,1:12:02.94,portfolio or something and some of them

1:12:00.540,1:12:09.27,are more thematic or

1:12:02.940,1:12:12.57,the book itself has some kind of loose

1:12:09.270,1:12:16.14,or tight stigma in my case it's usually

1:12:12.570,1:12:20.04,loose yeah structure um or trajectory

1:12:16.140,1:12:26.15,yeah and even the ones that are kind of

1:12:20.040,1:12:29.82,a sampler I spend a fair amount of time

1:12:26.150,1:12:32.48,trying to figure out what's the first

1:12:29.820,1:12:34.80,poem what's the last poem how what's the

1:12:32.480,1:12:37.11,movement how do they work together

1:12:34.800,1:12:39.63,how does some of the last lines of one's

1:12:37.110,1:12:42.03,feed into the title or the first line

1:12:39.630,1:12:43.92,the next one what looks good next in a

1:12:42.030,1:12:48.15,way it's like it's not like exactly I

1:12:43.920,1:12:52.05,can terrier decoration but you want it

1:12:48.150,1:12:54.42,to flow have ups and downs that with me

1:12:52.050,1:12:56.85,it's like I

1:12:54.420,1:12:58.74,what's the mixture of dark and funny

1:12:56.850,1:13:00.45,ones I mean you do a mini version of

1:12:58.740,1:13:05.19,that when you're doing a reading even

1:13:00.450,1:13:08.13,yeah and then sometimes it's like oh

1:13:05.190,1:13:09.60,this is going to be in sections and are

1:13:08.130,1:13:12.33,the sections going to be numbered or

1:13:09.600,1:13:15.60,basically manuscript construction right

1:13:12.330,1:13:19.17,yeah and if you're dealing with I mean

1:13:15.600,1:13:23.79,I've been really lucky and been able to

1:13:19.170,1:13:25.77,pick covers oh because you know it's a

1:13:23.790,1:13:27.63,funny thing you know the poems it's like

1:13:25.770,1:13:29.76,hardly anybody publishes poems anymore

1:13:27.630,1:13:31.53,and if you're lucky enough to get a book

1:13:29.760,1:13:34.71,of poems published it's usually they're

1:13:31.530,1:13:37.38,not treating it like it's you know yes

1:13:34.710,1:13:39.83,the next big bestseller they don't have

1:13:37.380,1:13:45.12,a big investment in it and but so that

1:13:39.830,1:13:48.81,the fact that it's much less a big deal

1:13:45.120,1:13:51.69,to them has its pros and it's cons but

1:13:48.810,1:13:53.55,one of the pros is I've usually they're

1:13:51.690,1:13:56.49,not going to impose a cover on me

1:13:53.550,1:13:58.02,because it's not like well this is going

1:13:56.490,1:14:01.32,to be a blockbuster and therefore we

1:13:58.020,1:14:03.33,need to have this kind of cover right so

1:14:01.320,1:14:06.18,I get to pick covers by artists that I

1:14:03.330,1:14:08.85,like usually so thinking about that and

1:14:06.180,1:14:10.77,how the title the overall title of the

1:14:08.850,1:14:15.86,book and where that's going to come from

1:14:10.770,1:14:17.79,and yeah how getting back to kind of the

1:14:15.860,1:14:19.74,computer not a good thing how does that

1:14:17.790,1:14:21.66,I mean how did you learn like without

1:14:19.740,1:14:24.87,the computer and then did it change what

1:14:21.660,1:14:26.94,you got well this is where I need to be

1:14:24.870,1:14:28.89,more this is one of many places where I

1:14:26.940,1:14:31.41,would love to be more tech savvy because

1:14:28.890,1:14:34.14,I keep asking friends of mine who are

1:14:31.410,1:14:37.08,graphic artists like isn't there a

1:14:34.140,1:14:41.39,program or a piece of software where you

1:14:37.080,1:14:45.66,can lay out a book like in a grid and

1:14:41.390,1:14:49.80,because I end up spreading the book out

1:14:45.660,1:14:52.52,like the floor okay and then putting it

1:14:49.800,1:14:54.35,together and paging through it you know

1:14:52.520,1:14:59.00,like we were talking about at the

1:14:54.350,1:15:01.33,beginning I want to be looking at it in

1:14:59.000,1:15:04.25,something in a way that's analogous to

1:15:01.330,1:15:06.89,yeah the final product but it would be

1:15:04.250,1:15:08.90,very convenient if I could look at

1:15:06.890,1:15:10.79,something that showed where each page

1:15:08.900,1:15:13.40,was and what all the double-page spreads

1:15:10.790,1:15:15.71,yeah or etcetera and I haven't found

1:15:13.400,1:15:17.41,something that works like that so I'm

1:15:15.710,1:15:20.60,sitting here getting dog hair all over

1:15:17.410,1:15:22.82,the pages and either putting it on the

1:15:20.600,1:15:26.18,floor trying to do it on a long table or

1:15:22.820,1:15:27.92,I think that I've been doing it for the

1:15:26.180,1:15:29.24,whole time and so so this is made it

1:15:27.920,1:15:30.53,easier to move things around and stuff

1:15:29.240,1:15:32.20,within the document but in terms of

1:15:30.530,1:15:35.57,constructing the document you're still

1:15:32.200,1:15:40.31,in the dark ages with you know lint and

1:15:35.570,1:15:43.01,dog hair and crumbs but that's I'm sure

1:15:40.310,1:15:46.37,there is I'm sure at this point there

1:15:43.010,1:15:49.25,are multiple programs that there must be

1:15:46.370,1:15:51.47,if I knew how to use them I could pull

1:15:49.250,1:15:53.66,the thing together and look at it on a

1:15:51.470,1:15:56.36,grid or two grids or something like that

1:15:53.660,1:16:01.13,or you began things Anna do that it's

1:15:56.360,1:16:06.34,not that difficult but yeah I've not

1:16:01.130,1:16:08.66,found something that's easy to you then

1:16:06.340,1:16:12.14,available to me that I know it where I

1:16:08.660,1:16:13.85,can just do that right I think yeah the

1:16:12.140,1:16:16.19,thing that most people use InDesign and

1:16:13.850,1:16:17.90,they're next but that's a $200 $3.0,
1:16:16.190,1:16:19.61,program and it takes to learning so

1:16:17.900,1:16:23.21,learning curve so yeah and I'm always

1:16:19.610,1:16:25.28,like oh I could be I could be writing

1:16:23.210,1:16:26.96,instead of you know this piece of

1:16:25.280,1:16:29.18,software that I'm only going to use once

1:16:26.960,1:16:31.88,every three years when I'm like enough

1:16:29.180,1:16:34.76,have a book come out if reason but that

1:16:31.880,1:16:38.47,I should still do it I don't know

1:16:34.760,1:16:38.47,I mean it's used to work for you

1:16:40.240,1:16:45.32,goodness what was that so how do you I

1:16:43.790,1:16:47.21,guess so in the process of making this

1:16:45.320,1:16:49.22,how do you track the pieces and just you

1:16:47.210,1:16:51.41,keep them in this book you pick them out

1:16:49.220,1:16:52.70,and put them in the sort of folders is

1:16:51.410,1:16:55.94,that is that how it's been consistently

1:16:52.700,1:16:58.94,done I do that and I have a folder of

1:16:55.940,1:17:00.98,things that I'm currently working on and

1:16:58.940,1:17:03.62,I keep sort of looking at that and

1:17:00.980,1:17:04.94,seeing if I'm reaching critical mass and

1:17:03.620,1:17:06.02,then there's ones that sort of sink to

1:17:04.940,1:17:09.32,the bottom that I know

1:17:06.020,1:17:10.88,kind of yeah use unless I get some

1:17:09.320,1:17:12.65,revelation and can really clean them up

1:17:10.880,1:17:18.26,and there are others that are contenders

1:17:12.650,1:17:19.76,and okay and then in terms of when so

1:17:18.260,1:17:20.78,when you're all done with it's like when

1:17:19.760,1:17:22.55,you're done with the manuscript and

1:17:20.780,1:17:25.13,stuff what are you sort of archival the

1:17:22.550,1:17:26.66,physical and digital practices there I

1:17:25.130,1:17:28.40,mean are you do you put that in a

1:17:26.660,1:17:35.21,certain box and put that somewhere well

1:17:28.400,1:17:38.57,I make I make the the folder that is the

1:17:35.210,1:17:43.00,book yeah that I'm going to submit to

1:17:38.570,1:17:47.87,see if I can get it published yeah and I

1:17:43.000,1:17:51.20,in order to have arrived at that I've

1:17:47.870,1:17:56.33,printed things out and done my gun G

1:17:51.200,1:17:58.97,little note X okay on the floor dogs

1:17:56.330,1:18:03.10,walking over it yeah leaves falling on

1:17:58.970,1:18:06.67,it kind of procedure that I was yeah

1:18:03.100,1:18:12.53,shamefacedly describing few moments ago

1:18:06.670,1:18:14.78,and so I end up with a paper copy in the

1:18:12.530,1:18:17.78,file at least one and also if I'm sure

1:18:14.780,1:18:20.06,at that point I'm usually trying to

1:18:17.780,1:18:22.79,bribe a couple friends into reading it

1:18:20.060,1:18:26.45,before I send it off so I'm either

1:18:22.790,1:18:30.89,emailing them or handing them a copy

1:18:26.450,1:18:36.16,I've got a copy there's a copy on the

1:18:30.890,1:18:39.23,computer there's a copy in whatever

1:18:36.160,1:18:41.81,virtual world my backup system backs it

1:18:39.230,1:18:43.64,up into and eventually gives a copy

1:18:41.810,1:18:47.03,that's submitted to the publisher and

1:18:43.640,1:18:49.10,then so say like a few years on you

1:18:47.030,1:18:50.78,still have to those archival copies

1:18:49.100,1:19:00.44,somewhere on your computer of those

1:18:50.780,1:19:04.91,manuscripts you know I I I mean now I

1:19:00.440,1:19:07.67,will because of the way I used to backup

1:19:04.910,1:19:09.32,wasn't just on an external but a certain

1:19:07.670,1:19:11.99,harddrive yeah that just plugged in

1:19:09.320,1:19:13.73,right but I had problems with those and

1:19:11.990,1:19:16.97,also with the house burned down that

1:19:13.730,1:19:18.86,would burn down too yeah but now

1:19:16.970,1:19:20.98,whisking things back up into

1:19:18.860,1:19:23.92,cloud or other people systems or stuff

1:19:20.989,1:19:26.00,like that it's just going to exist there

1:19:23.929,1:19:28.21,but when I have a book come out I don't

1:19:26.000,1:19:31.42,I think okay that's it the book came out

1:19:28.219,1:19:34.21,and the book is the thing and then in

1:19:31.429,1:19:35.81,the floating galaxy of Carbonite there's

1:19:34.219,1:19:38.17,already a copy of it and that's sort of

1:19:35.810,1:19:39.92,enough so I mean do you have a you have

1:19:38.179,1:19:41.60,like a different ceiling say about that

1:19:39.920,1:19:45.13,I printed out manuscript that you've

1:19:41.600,1:19:46.79,worked on in like the document file on

1:19:45.139,1:19:47.88,the thing I mean just one feel more fear

1:19:46.790,1:19:50.81,to you

1:19:47.889,1:19:54.92,I'm not Precious about that sort of

1:19:50.810,1:19:56.33,stuff okay people have yelled at me once

1:19:54.920,1:19:58.40,and we're like what you don't keep your

1:19:56.330,1:20:01.25,draft you don't keep copies or you don't

1:19:58.400,1:20:05.54,get it and I'm like my office is this

1:20:01.250,1:20:08.54,big right I don't have I get rid of

1:20:05.540,1:20:10.28,things so that I have you know and two

1:20:08.540,1:20:15.35,writers live in this house and books are

1:20:10.280,1:20:20.63,coming in like every moment a it's just

1:20:15.350,1:20:25.96,a constant battle with the rising swell

1:20:20.630,1:20:26.63,of paper avalanche so you know I know I

1:20:25.969,1:20:28.79,don't

1:20:26.630,1:20:32.94,okay keep a lot of stuff like that

1:20:28.790,1:20:36.01,because I want to have room for producer

1:20:32.949,1:20:40.00,okay so I have I have some sort of

1:20:36.010,1:20:41.96,general questions about computers and

1:20:40.000,1:20:45.83,I'd like to talk a little bit about

1:20:41.960,1:20:47.48,correspondence to teaching images and

1:20:45.830,1:20:48.77,these may be a little repetitive but I

1:20:47.480,1:20:51.94,think we could get at them really

1:20:48.770,1:20:53.69,quickly um so do you think then the kind

1:20:51.949,1:20:56.84,of advent of personal computing it

1:20:53.690,1:21:02.00,affect greatly your writing practices or

1:20:56.840,1:21:05.00,your writing style um writing practices

1:21:02.000,1:21:08.75,for sure and I think productivity and

1:21:05.000,1:21:11.21,productivity in terms of style though do

1:21:08.750,1:21:13.85,you think that they were definite

1:21:11.210,1:21:19.21,changes or but well it certainly aided

1:21:13.850,1:21:25.28,and abetted my tendencies towards

1:21:19.219,1:21:29.06,research yeah and it's it quickened and

1:21:25.280,1:21:31.36,made more efficient and broadened the

1:21:29.060,1:21:35.44,range of my research

1:21:31.369,1:21:38.54,does that make sense yeah no it does

1:21:35.440,1:21:40.79,are there any sort of style techniques

1:21:38.540,1:21:45.73,or formats that you think you lost from

1:21:40.790,1:21:50.98,moving into the computers not for me man

1:21:45.730,1:21:57.11,just game time because you just had to

1:21:50.989,1:21:58.61,retype yeah everything I think you've

1:21:57.110,1:21:59.81,covered a lot of these I mean one of the

1:21:58.610,1:22:01.79,questions is does the internet play a

1:21:59.810,1:22:05.21,role in your practices yeah pretty sure

1:22:01.790,1:22:06.80,it does yes and your connect like do you

1:22:05.210,1:22:09.34,ever disconnect when you're when you're

1:22:06.800,1:22:11.75,working I mean is it ever too much of a

1:22:09.349,1:22:15.09,distraction for you or is it you know

1:22:11.750,1:22:17.19,that's not the thing I do is I just

1:22:15.099,1:22:20.36,close email

1:22:17.199,1:22:22.13,okay so email is the kind of play you

1:22:20.360,1:22:23.71,know the way this computer you know the

1:22:22.130,1:22:27.46,way things are set up it's like if

1:22:23.719,1:22:31.61,you're doing any tasks on the computer

1:22:27.469,1:22:33.05,whether it's for school or if you're

1:22:31.610,1:22:35.63,working on a poem or if you're doing

1:22:33.050,1:22:37.63,research or whatever you know the email

1:22:35.630,1:22:39.88,thing is like I always have the sound

1:22:37.639,1:22:42.34,turned off my job my tech friend makes

1:22:39.889,1:22:45.17,fun of me but I I don't

1:22:42.349,1:22:47.33,I'm very weird and I don't like the

1:22:45.170,1:22:49.67,noises the computer makes I find them

1:22:47.330,1:22:54.08,distracting but even if you turn off the

1:22:49.670,1:22:57.50,sound yeah there's a little box that

1:22:54.080,1:23:01.76,comes up that slake that not only tells

1:22:57.500,1:23:07.25,you you have email but is like you know

1:23:01.760,1:23:09.19,the medical quadrant at University of

1:23:07.250,1:23:10.96,California Irvine wants to know if you

1:23:09.199,1:23:12.98,want to participate in the study of

1:23:10.969,1:23:15.11,people who have bad skin diseases

1:23:12.980,1:23:18.26,you know I this is like flashing in the

1:23:15.110,1:23:20.17,corner right of the thing every not like

1:23:18.260,1:23:23.94,I'm so popular or anything half of it

1:23:20.179,1:23:26.23,spam but still so I come in that is

1:23:23.949,1:23:30.61,interruptive and distracting and so I

1:23:26.239,1:23:33.46,just turn email off but I do for me I

1:23:30.619,1:23:39.77,like to do even my use of a dictionary

1:23:33.469,1:23:40.96,for use of a Saurus or use of a synonym

1:23:39.770,1:23:44.64,yeah

1:23:40.969,1:23:46.59,dictionary all those things

1:23:44.640,1:23:48.69,are on the internet so I don't have to

1:23:46.590,1:23:51.63,like go in the other room this is where

1:23:48.690,1:23:55.58,it is come back I can just with the

1:23:51.630,1:23:55.58,internet on in the email off right

1:23:58.580,1:24:02.34,usually this is what happens we cover

1:24:00.450,1:24:06.12,mostly and then I just want to catch a

1:24:02.340,1:24:07.47,few more things do you okay well did we

1:24:06.120,1:24:09.69,sort of talk about this real briefly but

1:24:07.470,1:24:11.46,you are you able to find the files that

1:24:09.690,1:24:14.54,you're looking for on your computer like

1:24:11.460,1:24:22.38,if you're thinking about something yeah

1:24:14.540,1:24:26.70,usually because not only because the

1:24:22.380,1:24:29.67,naming and the capacity to easily update

1:24:26.700,1:24:33.15,or change names as much as you want but

1:24:29.670,1:24:35.91,also sometimes I can't find a file but I

1:24:33.150,1:24:38.13,remember I used the word artichoke in

1:24:35.910,1:24:41.00,that poem you can search for that yeah

1:24:38.130,1:24:43.11,like I try to think okay well if I can't

1:24:41.000,1:24:44.70,god damn it I can't remember what I

1:24:43.110,1:24:46.83,named the thing I've changed the name

1:24:44.700,1:24:48.93,five times but then I'll think we'll do

1:24:46.830,1:24:51.18,you know I used the word to take in

1:24:48.930,1:24:54.15,there so I can search for that you think

1:24:51.180,1:24:56.82,how did like before those capabilities

1:24:54.150,1:25:00.51,were available like in the 90s etc what

1:24:56.820,1:25:01.74,did did your we're more specific about

1:25:00.510,1:25:03.60,your titling I mean where there are

1:25:01.740,1:25:05.46,other things that you did then I still

1:25:03.600,1:25:08.76,occasionally it takes me a while I was

1:25:05.460,1:25:14.58,living but mostly between those two

1:25:08.760,1:25:17.28,things I can and before I have more

1:25:14.580,1:25:20.85,stuff on my computer now I think yeah

1:25:17.280,1:25:23.70,back when um it was just titling and I

1:25:20.850,1:25:27.48,couldn't search for specific terms or

1:25:23.700,1:25:29.67,names that would there were less things

1:25:27.480,1:25:33.48,on the computer mostly for writing yeah

1:25:29.670,1:25:35.40,okay and do you feel how do you kind of

1:25:33.480,1:25:38.28,feel about the security and fixity of

1:25:35.400,1:25:39.87,your files do you worry about them or do

1:25:38.280,1:25:41.46,you feel pretty confident in your

1:25:39.870,1:25:43.68,situation you said you had some issues

1:25:41.460,1:25:45.78,before so I'm assuming that's really

1:25:43.680,1:25:48.24,kind of well it was do you mean the

1:25:45.780,1:25:51.33,security of the computer in general I

1:25:48.240,1:25:55.44,think everyone is is pretty freaked out

1:25:51.330,1:25:57.96,about yeah that yeah um I don't get

1:25:55.440,1:26:01.08,scared about people stealing my little

1:25:57.960,1:26:05.40,homes right guys I don't think anyone

1:26:01.080,1:26:08.91,cares clinically but in terms of

1:26:05.400,1:26:11.19,invading like my bank account or my

1:26:08.910,1:26:13.53,personal information or my passwords or

1:26:11.190,1:26:15.60,other computer things you know

1:26:13.530,1:26:18.48,contemporary life is a nightmare of

1:26:15.600,1:26:20.82,losing privacy and being surveilled and

1:26:18.480,1:26:23.94,the computer is a major source of that

1:26:20.820,1:26:26.18,so I'm as scared as everyone else yeah I

1:26:23.940,1:26:28.53,guess I'm I'm sort of thinking more

1:26:26.180,1:26:30.42,mundane me about just like are you

1:26:28.530,1:26:32.82,worried that your documents will all

1:26:30.420,1:26:34.71,sort of you know Carbonite drops and we

1:26:32.820,1:26:35.76,lose them I mean like is that is that

1:26:34.710,1:26:38.07,something or do you feel pretty secure

1:26:35.760,1:26:39.98,as well and were there different stages

1:26:38.070,1:26:42.78,in the writing that you are like much

1:26:39.989,1:26:44.55,more careful about them now then you

1:26:42.780,1:26:47.40,said Oh Carbonite jobs maybe I'll get

1:26:44.550,1:26:50.94,another one - and I mean I figure

1:26:47.400,1:26:54.15,between my printing stuff out my

1:26:50.940,1:26:57.03,computer my multiple devices yeah and

1:26:54.150,1:26:59.13,Carbonite you're really well set up as a

1:26:57.030,1:27:01.89,digital archivist everybody I'm okay

1:26:59.130,1:27:04.96,we're happy to hear it I'm probably more

1:27:01.890,1:27:08.37,or less okay and if I'm not okay because

1:27:04.969,1:27:11.31,yeah the meteor comes and we're a fiery

1:27:08.370,1:27:12.98,inferno of a planet oh well I don't know

1:27:11.310,1:27:15.18,what I can do about it

1:27:12.989,1:27:18.33,but you came to these you came to this

1:27:15.180,1:27:20.61,practice because of bad experiences yeah

1:27:18.330,1:27:26.10,both my own and hearing about other

1:27:20.610,1:27:28.38,people's yeah so I guess in terms of

1:27:26.100,1:27:29.96,like then sort of corresponding with

1:27:28.380,1:27:32.67,other writers about your writing if you

1:27:29.969,1:27:34.77,do a lot of that by like type writing

1:27:32.670,1:27:36.59,and paper in the beginning and then how

1:27:34.770,1:27:40.35,has that sort of changed over the course

1:27:36.590,1:27:42.41,what it's utterly different - I mean I

1:27:40.350,1:27:46.38,had a postal scale

1:27:42.410,1:27:48.71,uh-huh I you know everything was like

1:27:46.380,1:27:54.60,weighing stuff and going to the post

1:27:48.719,1:27:57.75,office and stamped and you know printing

1:27:54.600,1:28:00.90,and you know which was falling but right

1:27:57.750,1:28:03.12,now I mean email is a dream the only

1:28:00.900,1:28:05.82,thing that bugs me about well there's

1:28:03.120,1:28:08.79,two things that one is security and yeah

1:28:05.820,1:28:10.27,lack of privacy and the other is that

1:28:08.790,1:28:15.46,it's kind of

1:28:10.270,1:28:18.07,liable as I you know Aquino uses it I

1:28:15.460,1:28:18.82,always think that the next technology is

1:28:18.070,1:28:20.77,flawless

1:28:18.820,1:28:25.36,you know it's God it's perfect but

1:28:20.770,1:28:27.16,yesterday I said it turns out that I my

1:28:25.360,1:28:31.24,server has seems to have a problem with

1:28:27.160,1:28:33.37,Gmail and not and you know in two-thirds

1:28:31.240,1:28:36.61,of people I know or do business with FG

1:28:33.370,1:28:38.14,mail and so now it's like oh ten percent

1:28:36.610,1:28:40.54,of the things I send to Gmail are not

1:28:38.140,1:28:44.95,getting there how fantastic that oh yeah

1:28:40.540,1:28:48.57,really great yeah what's that so but no

1:28:44.950,1:28:53.10,email emails I think great for writers

1:28:48.570,1:28:57.94,correspondents for sending people I mean

1:28:53.100,1:29:01.57,going back and forth with revisions all

1:28:57.940,1:29:04.51,that and you feel like there's a

1:29:01.570,1:29:06.13,difference and feel between the ways of

1:29:04.510,1:29:07.96,communicating I mean the sort of regular

1:29:06.130,1:29:11.55,mail versus you know these are all

1:29:07.960,1:29:14.50,mediums yeah right and yeah they all

1:29:11.550,1:29:16.84,their mediums or technologies are both

1:29:14.500,1:29:20.55,and they have their own characteristics

1:29:16.840,1:29:25.35,right they're like almost it's not as

1:29:20.550,1:29:30.46,it's not the same as a genre but no they

1:29:25.350,1:29:33.10,they require different things of us as

1:29:30.460,1:29:38.26,producers and consumers and they have

1:29:33.100,1:29:39.76,different effects yes I don't I find it

1:29:38.260,1:29:44.07,difficult to believe that anyone would

1:29:39.760,1:29:48.72,argue with that you know Sophia yeah

1:29:44.070,1:29:52.89,email is has many of the same

1:29:48.720,1:29:57.94,characteristics but is different from a

1:29:52.890,1:30:00.04,written letter and a letter written on a

1:29:57.940,1:30:02.89,manual typewriter is different from you

1:30:00.040,1:30:06.67,know Charles Dickens dipping his pen if

1:30:02.890,1:30:11.05,that's indeed what he did you know yeah

1:30:06.670,1:30:13.00,yeah no okay so then how do you are

1:30:11.050,1:30:19.20,there ways in which you save your

1:30:13.000,1:30:23.51,certain digital correspondence oh yeah I

1:30:19.200,1:30:27.95,some emails I print out

1:30:23.519,1:30:31.19,and many I save by leaving them on the

1:30:27.959,1:30:33.83,commuter and is that and then I've

1:30:31.199,1:30:35.51,embassy and again since the gods of

1:30:33.839,1:30:35.84,Carbonite are supposedly looking out for

1:30:35.519,1:30:37.91,me

1:30:35.849,1:30:41.48,yeah saved their to save their to and

1:30:37.919,1:30:43.67,then but you do do specific things save

1:30:41.489,1:30:46.39,specific correspondent side sometimes

1:30:43.679,1:30:50.01,yes yes and then with the physical

1:30:46.399,1:30:52.60,correspondence is that do you do you say

1:30:50.010,1:30:57.19,specific things there too sure once once

1:30:52.609,1:31:00.71,not bragging but once I got a little

1:30:57.199,1:31:03.23,letter from John Ashbery a tiny one

1:31:00.719,1:31:06.53,about something and bet your bottom

1:31:03.239,1:31:10.85,dollar I saved that yeah it that I was

1:31:06.539,1:31:13.64,like my good where once I wrote a review

1:31:10.859,1:31:15.71,of a biography of frank O'Hara and his

1:31:13.649,1:31:18.23,like brother wrote me oh really

1:31:15.719,1:31:20.74,something to get a little card thing I

1:31:18.239,1:31:23.09,like totally save things like that yeah

1:31:20.749,1:31:24.23,because they're meaningful not because I

1:31:23.099,1:31:26.96,think I'm going to like sell them on

1:31:24.239,1:31:27.83,eBay or sometimes great no yeah

1:31:26.969,1:31:32.72,absolutely

1:31:27.839,1:31:34.79,um and then I guess so as computers came

1:31:32.729,1:31:38.36,into your work life and jasmine to do

1:31:34.799,1:31:39.92,your teaching did this I mean I know

1:31:38.369,1:31:41.03,that's that changed dramatically I mean

1:31:39.929,1:31:43.46,what do you feel like are the

1:31:41.039,1:31:44.66,differences between you know having this

1:31:43.469,1:31:47.36,sort of immediate access that we have

1:31:44.669,1:31:48.80,now versus where before you were I mean

1:31:47.369,1:31:51.65,I guess corresponding more when

1:31:48.809,1:31:55.55,mailboxes and in person first for

1:31:51.659,1:31:57.98,teaching teaching yeah gosh I'm not I

1:31:55.559,1:32:00.23,mean I want to take classes and be able

1:31:57.989,1:32:04.31,to take better advantage of this but I

1:32:00.239,1:32:07.61,mean I have taken to bringing an iPad to

1:32:04.319,1:32:10.67,class because like we were looking at a

1:32:07.619,1:32:14.51,I think it was a frank O'Hara poem and

1:32:10.679,1:32:17.18,it brought a bitty Grabel none of the

1:32:14.519,1:32:19.88,undergraduates in class understandably

1:32:17.189,1:32:22.04,had any idea who Betty Grable was right

1:32:19.889,1:32:23.24,size able to dip dip dip here's a pic

1:32:22.049,1:32:25.82,here's Betty Grable

1:32:23.249,1:32:27.35,you know pin-up girl and here's who she

1:32:25.829,1:32:30.32,was and here's some Biograph going from

1:32:27.359,1:32:33.56,it or we can look up a word or because

1:32:30.329,1:32:36.46,they are not books in the classroom yeah

1:32:33.569,1:32:39.19,I in the old days I used to sometimes

1:32:36.469,1:32:43.21,bring a dictionary to class yeah and I

1:32:39.199,1:32:44.36,was like I can carry o it up so though

1:32:43.219,1:32:46.61,it's always been important to you though

1:32:44.360,1:32:50.30,it gives kind of outside context in your

1:32:46.610,1:32:53.23,teaching I'm teaching writing and books

1:32:50.300,1:32:57.86,and literature in English we need to be

1:32:53.239,1:32:59.44,able to look stuff up I mean you know

1:32:57.860,1:33:03.13,that's kind of a given so the fact that

1:32:59.440,1:33:07.47,we can have a dictionary or people can

1:33:03.139,1:33:09.88,be arguing about whether you know

1:33:07.479,1:33:14.11,negative capability with something that

1:33:09.889,1:33:19.67,keeps thought of or yeah Britney Spears

1:33:14.119,1:33:22.15,I can go look it up and say hey um do

1:33:19.670,1:33:23.63,you think then that so is this the first

1:33:22.159,1:33:26.80,year you've brought the iPad into the

1:33:23.630,1:33:32.42,class no I started doing that a few few

1:33:26.809,1:33:36.03,years ago years ago um it or somebody's

1:33:32.420,1:33:38.65,written a poem based on a painting yeah

1:33:36.039,1:33:40.96,you can look at it things like this are

1:33:38.659,1:33:43.99,really good and if I was more tech savvy

1:33:40.960,1:33:47.21,when I am lucky enough to be booked into

1:33:43.999,1:33:50.05,like a smart classroom right you could

1:33:47.210,1:33:52.63,actually project yeah that stuff or

1:33:50.059,1:33:54.73,material I want to get to that point

1:33:52.639,1:33:58.28,where I can do PowerPoint things or I

1:33:54.739,1:33:59.71,can project a poem and you know I mean

1:33:58.280,1:34:03.80,you're different colors like that yeah

1:33:59.719,1:34:05.98,yeah so every aspect of teaching the

1:34:03.800,1:34:06.86,kinds of things that I teach you know

1:34:05.989,1:34:11.11,yeah

1:34:06.860,1:34:13.82,and I guess you know this entrance of

1:34:11.110,1:34:16.82,you know workshops every you know

1:34:13.820,1:34:19.13,everyone sends their poem yeah by email

1:34:16.820,1:34:20.38,I think when I was there was still you

1:34:19.130,1:34:24.34,still had to go drop them in the mailbox

1:34:20.389,1:34:29.03,right so did this I mean has this sort

1:34:24.349,1:34:30.38,of and 12 has the entrance of this into

1:34:29.030,1:34:34.84,the classroom had effect on your own

1:34:30.380,1:34:36.82,writing at all in terms of something in

1:34:34.849,1:34:38.17,the classroom like entrances of techno I

1:34:36.829,1:34:39.26,mean like the kind of like you know I

1:34:38.179,1:34:41.53,mean like all of a sudden you have a

1:34:39.260,1:34:43.55,device small enough that you can bring

1:34:41.539,1:34:45.26,in and use in a very powerful way

1:34:43.550,1:34:47.42,whereas before we would have been you

1:34:45.260,1:34:49.72,huffing in that I mean because that

1:34:47.420,1:34:50.84,affected you I mean in your relate

1:34:49.729,1:34:58.19,with your students and then you're

1:34:50.840,1:35:04.78,writing bad questions well I think he'd

1:34:58.190,1:35:10.28,just you know you want the classroom to

1:35:04.789,1:35:13.88,be a vivid lively energetic productive

1:35:10.280,1:35:17.11,place and when I was a little kid there

1:35:13.880,1:35:20.53,was a lot of stuff in the classroom yeah

1:35:17.119,1:35:24.07,and now there isn't the classroom is

1:35:20.539,1:35:29.46,sort of like a white cube in a way yeah

1:35:24.079,1:35:33.01,so actually digital stuff to me

1:35:29.469,1:35:35.44,substitutes for or contains the idea of

1:35:33.019,1:35:44.74,having a lot of books right or a lot of

1:35:35.449,1:35:49.95,pictures a lot of reference things yeah

1:35:44.749,1:35:55.19,in the classroom again which is really

1:35:49.959,1:35:59.95,actually important yeah to make

1:35:55.190,1:36:02.63,something it's not exactly hands-on in

1:35:59.959,1:36:05.84,the way that a chemistry class would be

1:36:02.630,1:36:09.92,if you're working with beakers and petri

1:36:05.840,1:36:13.42,dishes and stuff like that but it it

1:36:09.920,1:36:16.84,helps connect the things that you're

1:36:13.429,1:36:21.11,talking about in classrooms to the

1:36:16.840,1:36:23.69,concrete right via the digital I think

1:36:21.110,1:36:30.22,yeah and make it real and make it vivid

1:36:23.690,1:36:33.32,and make it connected and for you to be

1:36:30.229,1:36:35.90,able to follow ideas and reach out to

1:36:33.320,1:36:39.86,the connected ideas and see where things

1:36:35.900,1:36:41.42,are coming from and then I guess in -

1:36:39.860,1:36:43.63,that end do you feel like the students

1:36:41.420,1:36:45.55,you have now have a different really

1:36:43.639,1:36:48.80,cultural completely second full

1:36:45.559,1:36:52.15,understanding and oh no no no the every

1:36:48.800,1:36:54.11,generation of them does and then I do I

1:36:52.159,1:36:55.94,mean I try to fake it and act like I'm

1:36:54.110,1:36:59.17,all and I bring my iPad this class we

1:36:55.940,1:37:01.67,even partly to be like okay you know I'm

1:36:59.179,1:37:03.05,a bunch older than you but don't write

1:37:01.670,1:37:06.17,me off I'm actually

1:37:03.050,1:37:08.33,yeah exactly so I don't kick me out of

1:37:06.170,1:37:10.43,the world quite yet yeah yeah

1:37:08.330,1:37:12.23,is there anything I mean I mean I guess

1:37:10.430,1:37:14.81,the students are teaching in this at

1:37:12.230,1:37:16.64,this time and this year are probably

1:37:14.810,1:37:18.95,more connected than any students ever

1:37:16.640,1:37:22.70,right I mean but is there are you seeing

1:37:18.950,1:37:25.72,a difference in their proclivities or

1:37:22.700,1:37:28.91,anything like oh it's no I mean this is

1:37:25.720,1:37:31.67,they have grown up come you know

1:37:28.910,1:37:33.53,completely completely differently I mean

1:37:31.670,1:37:36.73,when I talk to other teachers you know

1:37:33.530,1:37:40.52,this is duh everyone knows this but the

1:37:36.730,1:37:44.48,one of the only downsides is everybody

1:37:40.520,1:37:46.40,has a computer or a device and I'm very

1:37:44.480,1:37:47.99,lucky with where I get to teach and what

1:37:46.400,1:37:50.06,I get to teach I'm not usually having

1:37:47.990,1:37:51.53,this problem but a lot of people are

1:37:50.060,1:37:53.21,having the problem you know people are

1:37:51.530,1:37:55.49,there shopping for shoes they're looking

1:37:53.210,1:37:58.25,at watches or talking to their friends

1:37:55.490,1:37:59.24,or looking at porn or it's what I mean
