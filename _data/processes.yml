  creation_generation: Rae Armantrout begins most of her poems by hand, in a notebook, filling pages with what she refers to as illegible text to initiate the drafting process. ... [then] typing up early drafts on an iPad once they begin to cohere
  composition_revision: Armantrout's approach to drafting is hybridized--she consistently relies on a flow of physical writing, typed transcription, and digital revision to move from lines and scraps into a finished poem. ... Her local revision priorities often revolve around sound, and take place at the word level.
  publication: As she begins to collect finished poems towards a collection, Armantrout prints out hard copies and assembles them in thesis binders. The purpose of the binders is twofold--it provides safe storage for the manuscript-in-progress, and also gives Armantrout a hands-on means by which to experiment with ordering and re-ordering poems within an evolving collection. ... As for completing an entire manuscript, Armantrout always strives to achieve connections that are at once 'perceptible' and 'surprising' to the reader. 
  organizing_archiving: A self-proclaimed 'poor curator of her own history,' Armantrout is less inclined towards frequent file back-ups. While some files do get saved on a zip drive, the majority are saved in the form of emails to Silliman and other correspondents. 
  pre_creation_generation: Rae Armantrout begins most of her poems by hand, in a notebook, filling pages with what she refers to as illegible text to initiate the drafting process. Prior to the advent of personal computers, she would remain in the handwriting phase much longer before eventually transferring her work to the page via an IBM Selectric typewriter.

- author: Bruce Beasley
  author-id: beasley
  creation_generation: Beasley typically begins work on poems by drafting words, lines, and phrases in notebooks, then typing them onto the computer. He also uses long walks, during which he mentally composes and physically jots down resonant words and lines onto notecards. ... Beasely draws heavily on etymology and aleatory practices. More recently, he has experimented with plugging lines and scraps into Google Translate in order to estrange himself from the familiar ideas and language as it presents itself in early notes and drafts. 
  composition_revision: Upon returning to his office after his generative walks, Beasley transfers each stray line onto individual notecards. From there, he plays around with various arrangements, continually ordering and re-ordering the lines, until eventually the structure begins to cohere into a poem. Simultaneously, Beasley drafts large prose blocks directly on the computer, which often include editorial suggestions and thematic objectives, after which Beasley types the poem draft on the computer and begins revision revision&#8212;a process that involves frequent and repetitive reading aloud, with a focus on rhythm and sound over obvious clarity, as well as the sharing of drafts with other poets, including his wife. 
  publication: For Beasley, manuscripts tend to operate similarly to long poems--that is, with a 'fractal-like' structure, in which stanzas are to the poems what individual poems are to the book. Once this overall structure begins to cohere, Beasley revises discrete poems to reflect that structure.
  organizing_archiving: Once or twice per year, he prints hard copies of his digitally-drafted notes and correspondence, binds them into a notebook, and stores the resulting archive in a file cabinet.
  pre_creation_generation: Prior to the advent of personal computers, he would typically begin work on poems by drafting words, lines, and phrases in notebooks, then typing large chunks of prose on a Selectric typewriter before printing them out on rolls of old-fashioned printer paper.

- author: Amy Gerstler
  author-id: gerstler
  creation_generation: Amy Gerstler is a hybrid artist. Whether she is jumping between poetry, nonfiction and hybrid works, or switching back and forth between handwritten notes and internet research, Gerstler consistently bridges the gap between physical and digital media.
  composition_revision: Gerstler uses the computer to experiment with multiple versions (lineating prose poems, for instance, or re-ordering stanzas) in a single-medium format. ... Gerstler's self-proclaimed revision mode is 'all over the place,' especially when it comes to the tangential research or obsessive preoccupation that ultimately promises to get at the real heart of the poem in progress.
  publication: Once she turns to constructing a manuscript, Gerstler  toggles between digital and physical practice--typing and visualizing on the computer, but still printing out the pages and laying them out on the floor. The final collection draft thus exists both on the computer and in a hard copy, one or both of which Gerstler then shows to friends and readers before eventually submitting to a publisher.
  organizing_archiving: Gerstler isn't 'precious' about her papers, and will often discard early paper drafts and notes once a final product has been published. 
  pre_creation_generation: Growing up, Gerstler wrote poems in spiral-bound notebooks. As she got older, she continued to draft first by hand, then eventually on the typewriter.
  pre_composition_revision: Prior to computers, she performed literal cut and paste with typwritten poem drafts, cutting up the lines and rearranging them with Scotch tape or glue to try out various revision ideas.

- author: Louise Glück
  author-id: gluck
  creation_generation: When transposing poems from her notebook to the typewriter, Glück revises as she goes--stopping whenever she reaches an impasse or ineffective line, putting a new sheet of paper in the typewriter, and starting over. Other times, when she is experiencing a productive 'brain corner,' she composes directly on the typewriter. Her process, then, varies from project to project.
  composition_revision: Her driving priority in revising individual poems has evolved from seeking something more honed and perfect to capturing a quotidian, 'human sounding,'voice--a sound akin to daily speech. Glück achieves this sonic revision without reading her poems aloud. Rather, she 'hears with her eyes' and picks up on rhythmic structures in her head. 
  publication: Glück seeks out the inherent parallels and connections that emerge within a working collection of poems--those that don't necessarily make themselves readily apparent during the writing process itself.
  organizing_archiving: When it comes to archives, Glück points out the limited value of these typewritten drafts to future scholars (most of which are simply typed pages, with few longhand notes, if any). Her notebooks, on the other hand, are rich with personal, diaristic content, as well as working lines for poems.
  pre_creation_generation: Earlier in her career, she composed poems on a typewriter--and from there, the shift was not from typewriter to computer, but rather back to longhand drafting (which was also how she composed her first book, Firstborn).

- author: K. Silem Mohammad
  author-id: mohammad
  creation_generation: Mohammad's transition into working with the Flarf Group in the early 2000s came to rely more heavily on internet resources (such as Google search results) to generate material for collage poems. When seeking out material for a Flarf poem, he would copy and paste large portions of text from Google search results pages into a Word document (including URLs and colored, linked text), remove this 'junk text,' and then remove extraneous punctuation and capitalization until he was left with pages of uniformally lowercase, black and white text.
  composition_revision: Mohammad's revision process is digital--he culls computer-generated material and then manipulates it in digital space. He manipulates the text towards a poetic composition, rearranging line orders and grouping them into stanzas (often tercets) and deleting language that didn't serve the evolving draft.  
  publication: In terms of creating a collection of these poems, Mohammad came to seek a 'lyric construct' or 'verbal shape' that was somehow limited to a specific bank of search terms. His revision priority thus revolved more around verbal arrangement (including rhythm and sound) than verbal thematics--all the while keeping in mind the constraint of the search used to generate the text in the first place. 
  organizing_archiving: Mohammad saves his poems and manuscripts as Word documents or PDF files, and saves copies of the published books.
  pre_creation_generation: Mohammad's initial forays into contemporary poetry were, in his words, more 'organic' and 'freehand,' typing the words and finding a kind of rhythm.

- author: Robert Pinsky 
  author-id: pinsky
  creation_generation: Most of the poet's initial process occurs in a heavily analog environment—he prefers to draft images and constructions on a yellow and black legal pad until he has accrued enough material to feel compelled to type it up.  The second a poem occurs to Pinsky, he gets right to work on it, almost immediately generating some kind of draft on his Macbook Pro, using Microsoft Office. 
  composition_revision: The poem, for Pinsky, begins and ends in the body, as it is composed by ear and, ultimately, received by ear. ... Pinsky's revision practices reflect his largely organic approach to composition. Though digitally generated, his poem drafts are printed-out and annotated or proofed by hand. Additionally, Pinsky will attempt to memorize a working draft and repeat it to himself at the end of the day—the portions he doesn't remember, he believes, are the portions that most likely need revisiting and revision. Pinsky also receives feedback from a network of other writers, all of whom he communicates with online.
  publication: Pinsky maintains a folder on his computer titled 'Book.pms,' which later acquires a more apt name, and which contains individual folders for each poem that each then contain numbered drafts.
  organizing_archiving: Pinsky acknowledges contemporary technological anxieties in regard to saving and keeping track of digital materials. Due to a previous, devastating computer crash, Pinsky maintains a Dropbox account and routinely backs-up his working drafts to an external hard drive (though he's admittedly somewhat 'ambivalent' about the permanence of this digital material).

- author: Michael Ryan
  author-id: ryan
  creation_generation: Ryan keeps a journal (as well as collected pieces of folded paper) for jotting down raw material. He also relies on definitions and etymologies, often looking up every word in a given poem (either online or in a physical dictionary) before deeming it complete.  ... Ryan starts his poem drafts by hand. What happens next, however, is up to chance--he might finish a poem immediately or go through 250 drafts before being relegated to one of the brown storage boxes where Ryan keeps his papers.
  composition_revision:  As he writes and re-writes, Ryan usually either on folded pieces of typing paper or on yellow legal pads, Ryan crosses things out or writes in alternative words and lines on the handwritten draft. If completion eludes him beyond this phase, he will re-copy the entire poem as many times as it takes to come closer to a finished product. ... When a poem will not yield, but also refuses to be discarded, that is when he slows down and pushes the revision process to completion. He describes this process as a 'pushing into' the poem, growing deeper and wider into the language and the subject. ... Only minor changes--edits to a specific article, for example--take place via digital media. 
  publication: Ryan will save the final drafts of each poem on the computer until he has enough to begin shaping a manuscript. From there, he will create a 'book folder' wherein he saves the final drafts of those poems he deems strong enough to include, then print out the poems and organize the manuscript manually.

  author-id: strickland
  creation_generation: Most of Strickland's initial generation occurs by hand, preferrably in large engineering notebooks filled with green graph paper. Her e-literature projects take place in many different programming languages and software contexts.
  composition_revision: she moves from notebook to Word 2003 to whichever programming or coding environment suits her latest collaborative project. While her notebooks function as a place to write and re-write (and sometimes even write over) collected thoughts and images, Strickland's approach to digital creation and revision is oriented around design, unity and structure. ... Many of Strickland's digital literature projects are highly collaborative. Whether these involve working in translation or sitting down with fellow writers and programmers to actualize an idea on the screen, she places great emphasis on partnership, communication, and digital experimentation within the writing process.

- author: Nance Van Winckel
  author-id: vanwinckel
  creation_generation: She now works on two or three poems simultaneously, on the same notebook page, with various images and lines respectively residing in the right or left-hand margins. These poems may converse, and end up as part of a series. Other times, they might resolve into a single poem during the revision stage.
  composition_revision: Van Winckel types revised drafts on one of three different computers--an iMac desktop, a Mac laptop, and an iPad. She may write in Pages on her iPad using a keyboard, then email poem drafts to herself and convert them into Word; or else type on her laptop computer and transfer files to the desktop using a memory stick. Once the work reaches a digital space, however, Van Winckel rarely returns to physical pages and longhand for revision. Rather than printing out copies of typed poems, she primarily revises on the screen. ... Van Winckel describes herself as a 'slasher,' making merciless cuts to the poems before passing them on to a few trusted readers and critics (including her husband, the artist Rik Nelson).
  publication: Van Winckel's process recalls a set of Matryoshka dolls-- the small components continually fitting together in larger physical containers before eventually ending up in the 'mother' container-that is, the hard drive, and eventually the book.  
  organizing_archiving: As for her eventual approach to backing-up and archiving work, it, too, is divided in terms of media types and repositories. Upon completeing a manuscript (that is, seeing it through to publication), Van Winckel removes the digital files from her desktop hard drive and puts them on a back-up disk. She also maintains a physical file, in which she stores galleys of the book alongisde the yellow legal tablet in which the project first took shape. 
  pre_creation_generation: Van Winckel's physical process is grounded in a daily afternoon walk around the park near her home. Once she comes to the page, starting out with longhand notes and drafts-sometimes 3 or 4, sometimes 10 or 12-Van Winckel writes in a variety of yellow legal tablet notebooks, one for each new project. Early fiction likewise began away from the page, with ideas for her first collection of stories coming to her during a drive to Chicago, and ending up scribbled on scratch paper found in her car.

- author: Robert Wrigley
  author-id: wrigley
  creation_generation: Wrigley's process begins with fleeting thoughts and images captured in pocket-size Moleskine notebooks. These serve as inspiration banks from which he draws ideas for new poems. 
  composition_revision: Robert Wrigley writes poems both by hand and at the computer, transitioning back and forth from physical to digital drafting in a kind of slow-motion bob and weave. ... Once he starts composing, Wrigley continues in longnand--in pencil--but this time in a larger 'Gemstone Collection' notebook, where he will explore the initial draft until he gets 'stuck' or impatient. From there, Wrigely moves to typing on a MacBook, seeking out those elements of movement and structure that reveal themselves in a typed versus hand-written format. Eventually, he will then print out a copy of the typed draft, and return to longhand for revisions and edits before transferring the changes to a digital format. ... In revision, Wrigley seeks out 'sound linkages' and 'evocative simplicity.' He relies on few correspondents when it comes to the revision process, beyond his wife, memoirist and fiction writer Kim Barnes.
  publication: When it comes to assembling a manuscript, Wrigley has a notetaking system of arrows and checkmarks to help track the various ways in which poems within a collection tie together. Once again, his process is a bob and weave--re-ordering poems to suit the structure of the book, and editing the individual poems themselves to reinforce that structure. During this stage as well, Wrigely maintains both digital and manual methods of notation and organization. always working with a combination of the two. 
  organizing_archiving: Wrigley archives work by saving to Mozy, the cloud, and his hard drive, as well as printing drafts off 'relentlessly,' and storing his collected papers in boxes. 
  pre_creation_generation: In addition to consulting his own notes in the Moleskine notebooks, Wrigley might (and still does) begin by pulling a book at random off the shelf, flipping through for a word or line, anything to jog an idea.
