Devices and Initial Composition,0:15:40,"I have to be able to move my pen around and make notes, first of all. I have to see what it looks like, what the duration is, and I have to be able to read the beginning and the end&#8212;I have to have it all in my head.",940

Writing Career,0:33:48,"I've been writing since I was a child. And I had a very high opinion of my early work, so I was sending books out to publishers in my early teens.",2028
Fast (and Slow) Writing,0:46:16,"The shape has always been periods in the desert&#8212;you know, without language&#8212;and then work. After I was 50, most of my books were written very fast. Like in six to eight weeks.",2776
Evolution of Style and Identifying Tics,0:57:50,"It's only afterward I think, 'Well, I can't do that again.' And then sometimes you see things like, 'Isn't it odd? I've never used a contraction. Ever,' and then you think, 'Well, I guess I have to figure out how to use a contraction.'",3470
Assembling The Collected Poems,1:02:27,"I thought it was suicidal to do. Most of my life, I was repelled by it in principle. The idea of doing it myself was horrifying. I mean, I never read my old books. I have no reason to.",3747
On Faithful and Virtuous Night and Writing Longhand,1:08:12,"So I have a whole bunch of these eerie notebooks, and I realized that it was working kind of well.

Rituals and Patterns,1:18:37,"I read garden catalogues and listened to Don Giovanni for two years, and I thought, 'I'm brain dead. Of course I can't write.'",4717

Collaboration and Sharing Drafts,1:43:29,"Sometimes, you'll feel these poems&#8212;if they're ever going to be understood by anyone&#8212;will be understood by X.

Choosing Not to Use a Computer,1:46:55,"It was a sense of how, sort of slovenly, handwriting became form. I don't get that on the screen. I don't see lines on the screen quite the same way, and I don't feel as though I'm making the letter.",6415
Digital Correspondence,1:48:32,"There was a period in my life when&#8212;even like ten, twelve years ago&#8212;I just wrote lots of letters to lots of people, and I loved getting letters back, and I loved writing letters. And then that stopped. I don't know why that stopped.",6512
