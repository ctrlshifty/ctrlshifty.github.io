Devices and Digital Practice,0:00:00,"Well, actually, I probably work primarily in this old school device called 'notebook' where I, you know, fill pages with illegible text, and then once I start to think that my text is coming together, very often I'll do a version of it--just type it into the iPad.",0
Current Practice (Digital vs. Physical Files and Formats),0:05:10,"I mostly save over, which is not a good idea. But sometimes I have printed out drafts, and I save drafts.

Archives and File Back-Ups (Using Email as an Archive Tool),0:06:21,"I do have a back up on a zip drive, but I haven't backed-up for several months. So, I'm careless.",381
Physical Manuscript Archives and Organization,0:08:10,"This is really old school. But the way I use it is, it helps me order&#8212;not only keep the poems for the manuscript, but I order the manuscript this way. I mean, I kind of decide what reads well by trying the poems out in different places.",490
Writing Career and Education,0:11:25,"I was interested in poetry since childhood. My mother read poetry to me. I wrote when I was a little kid, then I kind of stopped for a while. And then I started again in college and I was reading the poet Denise Levertov...",685
Generative Practice for Early Poems,0:20:02,"I often start that way--then, and still, you know. Just something that I hear or see, sort of peaks my interest. It could be something I read, and I'll write down a passage, or I'll write down something I overhear someone say, or even on television, I could hear something that I write down. And I kind of collect those things like a magpie until something starts to take off.",1202
Transition and Revision (Transferring Notes to the Typewriter or Computer),0:21:59,"I still, like I say, work in notebooks; but I am sure that I started going from the notebook to the computer sooner than I would have on a typewriter.",1319
Correspondence and Revision (Letters vs. Email),0:25:05,"I would type something up and send it, usually to a couple of people--two or three people--and I would get responses back. But it certainly--I mean, now we're so used to kind of this instant dialogue, instant gratification. Sometimes I think that that's, you know, maybe that's why I'm writing faster now. Really, it is the stimulation of that.",1505
Revision Priorites and Process,0:31:26,"I want there to be some kind of possible perceptible connection, but I also want it to be surprising. I want it to kind of go somewhere that you didn't expect it to go, or that I didn't expect it to go. So, sometimes the first thing I come up with is too obvious and sometimes what I come up with is too random. It's like Goldilocks and the Three Bears.",1886
Finished Work and Correspondence (On Developing An Archive),0:38:14,"I know you can save things on your hard drive and give your hard drive to a library, but God knows what's on my hard drive.

Social Media and Introduction of Email,0:41:57,"Which is really stupid because it's RAEA100900. I shouldn't say that anything my son said was stupid, but he was only about fourteen and I guess he thought that was--I feel like I'm James Bond or something with that email address.",2517
Infulence of Digital Tools on Daily Practice,0:43:54,"Well, I was never a great typist, so I was always making mistakes. So, it was always frustrating. Of course sometimes I hate my computer, too. I mean, it's not a question of the typing issue, but just--you know, we all hate our computers.",2634

Internet Research And Generative Principles (Relationship Between Physics and Poetry),0:51:33,"I'm using some ancient poets like Lucretius, who wrote about science, you know.

So, I was just doing some research about him on the computer and then printing them out.",3093
Digital Influence on Teaching,0:56:11,"I think that when you teach young people, you kind of, sort of stay in that world. You hear their expressions--I'm not saying I'm a digital native by a long shot--but you know, you sort of hear the way they talk and you get a bit of their mind set, and you know, you know their lingo. In a way that, I think, when I retire, I might miss that.",3371
