0:06:52.090,0:06:57.100,tinkering usually like with galleys and

0:06:55.180,0:06:58.630,everything and I'll keep a copy of the

0:06:57.100,0:07:01.360,galleys when the book is actually coming

0:06:58.630,0:07:04.840,out and that gets filed with the

0:07:01.360,0:07:07.600,notebooks then when I'm done whatsit and

0:07:04.840,0:07:09.430,then sort of over this is a kind of

0:07:07.600,0:07:11.710,quick question for me personally in the

0:07:09.430,0:07:14.110,librarians but have you ever received or

0:07:11.710,0:07:15.970,sought out information about methods for

0:07:14.110,0:07:18.550,digital archiving activities for like

0:07:15.970,0:07:19.960,best practices no no okay

0:07:18.550,0:07:23.050,and would you be interested in in

0:07:19.960,0:07:24.730,information about that or you know maybe

0:07:23.050,0:07:28.840,I was thinking about that the other day

0:07:24.730,0:07:33.160,a couple of I was thinking about making

0:07:28.840,0:07:36.670,a a book of selected stories from my for

0:07:33.160,0:07:40.180,books Astoria and realizing that my

0:07:36.670,0:07:43.180,first two books of stories I don't know

0:07:40.180,0:07:45.190,if I can access the computer files of

0:07:43.180,0:07:52.480,them anymore there oh right they're like

0:07:45.190,0:07:55.390,on Oh floppy disk or zip yeah I just I

0:07:52.480,0:07:57.340,don't know if I could yeah you know does

0:07:55.390,0:08:00.460,that mean I'm gonna have to retype those

0:07:57.340,0:08:06.970,suckers or there's usually a wider yeah

0:08:00.460,0:08:10.840,if I could even find them yeah you know

0:08:06.970,0:08:13.810,when we moved out here yeah so that

0:08:10.840,0:08:16.930,would be a major task to locate and

0:08:13.810,0:08:18.880,write so I really probably use some help

0:08:16.930,0:08:20.490,with that okay yeah no that's and that's

0:08:18.880,0:08:23.230,definitely something that you know that

0:08:20.490,0:08:25.180,that kind of period especially the 90s

0:08:23.230,0:08:26.740,all the different we're processing hot

0:08:25.180,0:08:30.700,clear and then all the different ways of

0:08:26.740,0:08:33.640,saving them and put people in yeah what

0:08:30.700,0:08:35.979,do you do okay so that was sort of a

0:08:33.640,0:08:40.330,quick okay quick beginning I'm just

0:08:35.979,0:08:43.490,gonna check this be sure looks like

0:08:40.330,0:08:46.370,okay um that's working so we're good

0:08:43.490,0:08:47.630,with that so this is going to be more

0:08:46.370,0:08:50.450,about the kind of overview of your

0:08:47.630,0:08:52.190,writing practices and generally and so

0:08:50.450,0:08:54.200,the sort of first couple questions are

0:08:52.190,0:08:56.660,just sort of broad and you can elaborate

0:08:54.200,0:08:58.339,as much or as little as you like but so

0:08:56.660,0:09:01.580,how long have you been writing in a more

0:08:58.339,0:09:04.670,professional capacity and like in a way

0:09:01.580,0:09:07.550,that was sort of I don't know feeding

0:09:04.670,0:09:09.440,you or giving you some sort of I mean

0:09:07.550,0:09:10.820,even even if like an MFA might be a kind

0:09:09.440,0:09:12.710,of professional sort of like when do you

0:09:10.820,0:09:16.220,think you started writing kind of

0:09:12.710,0:09:17.870,distant as your as your vocation where

0:09:16.220,0:09:19.640,as something that led to something that

0:09:17.870,0:09:23.930,would be your vocation was probably

0:09:19.640,0:09:27.140,teaching sue anybody yeah you know I I

0:09:23.930,0:09:31.250,guess since graduate school mm-hmm I

0:09:27.140,0:09:34.040,went to graduate school and I thought I

0:09:31.250,0:09:36.620,would just do that for a year that was

0:09:34.040,0:09:39.140,my plan I would go to graduate school

0:09:36.620,0:09:41.240,and creative writing for a year and then

0:09:39.140,0:09:44.589,I would go to medical school I had been

0:09:41.240,0:09:48.140,a pre-med major oh oh through college

0:09:44.589,0:09:51.620,okay but when I got to grad school I was

0:09:48.140,0:09:53.720,just totally happy doing my writing

0:09:51.620,0:09:58.160,thing and I just I never looked back so

0:09:53.720,0:10:00.620,I just I worked I started my so-called

0:09:58.160,0:10:07.160,practice there where I worked every day

0:10:00.620,0:10:09.470,on my writing and right that was okay

0:10:07.160,0:10:11.180,and where was that what to the

0:10:09.470,0:10:11.660,University Denver University of Denver

0:10:57.589,0:11:02.389,been here ever since and you and you and

0:10:59.779,0:11:04.190,you retired from I retired from Eastern

0:11:02.389,0:11:07.220,in oh seven okay

0:11:04.190,0:11:12.620,hey but you're continuing to teach at

0:11:07.220,0:11:14.990,Vermont College okay so so now we're

0:11:12.620,0:11:17.420,gonna get kind of we've always been

0:11:14.990,0:11:19.160,there but get to the kind of specific

0:11:17.420,0:11:20.959,writing practices sort of generally and

0:11:19.160,0:11:23.180,I have it kind of delineated into kind

0:11:20.959,0:11:25.579,of three stages a sort of drafting

0:11:23.180,0:11:27.740,prewriting notebook stage and then a

0:11:25.579,0:11:31.250,revision stage and then a kind of

0:11:27.740,0:11:33.440,organizational archival stages and what

0:11:31.250,0:11:34.820,I'd like to do is sort of go stage by

0:11:33.440,0:11:36.350,stage and ask you about kind of your

0:11:34.820,0:11:38.690,practices in the beginning and how those

0:11:36.350,0:11:40.310,have changed for each stage but if that

0:11:38.690,0:11:43.279,doesn't make sense to you we can do it a

0:11:40.310,0:11:45.620,different way that makes sense okay so

0:11:43.279,0:11:48.410,um I guess I'm I would like to first

0:11:45.620,0:11:50.660,start with talking about the sort of

0:11:48.410,0:11:54.949,ways you you draft and create your work

0:11:50.660,0:11:56.769,initially so what is your sort of

0:11:54.949,0:11:58.910,typical compositional practice

0:11:56.769,0:12:00.139,especially when you win and I'm

0:11:58.910,0:12:01.940,interested right now in kind of like

0:12:00.139,0:12:05.120,when you first started writing how are

0:12:01.940,0:12:14.300,you generating and composing your

0:12:05.120,0:12:18.040,writing at that point so yeah early on I

0:12:14.300,0:12:20.329,one of the things that's different now

0:12:18.040,0:12:24.980,has been for a long time early on I

0:12:20.329,0:12:28.519,would probably just work on a poem so I

0:12:24.980,0:12:30.620,would you know right I would have a page

0:12:28.519,0:12:34.870,in my notebook or whatever with some

0:12:30.620,0:12:37.370,lines and move things around on the page

0:12:34.870,0:12:40.610,and then I would have another page in

0:12:37.370,0:12:43.760,the notebook with a different poem but

0:12:40.610,0:12:48.069,over the years I've started working on

0:12:43.760,0:12:51.880,maybe two or three poems almost kind of

0:12:48.069,0:12:56.389,simultaneously you're on the same page

0:12:51.880,0:13:00.050,which feels kind of nutty but I was what

0:12:56.389,0:13:02.959,I was experiencing that kind of led me

0:13:00.050,0:13:06.350,this way was that a lot of times things

0:13:02.959,0:13:10.130,would be coming to me

0:13:06.350,0:13:12.020,images lines that didn't seem to belong

0:13:10.130,0:13:15.800,to the poem I thought I was working on

0:13:12.020,0:13:20.600,mmm and so I realized that it might be

0:13:15.800,0:13:23.240,helpful to to not confine myself so

0:13:20.600,0:13:26.210,that's why that was one of the sort of

0:13:23.240,0:13:28.880,the main transitions that I've noticed

0:13:26.210,0:13:31.790,in my I think that happened maybe you

0:13:28.880,0:13:34.430,know sort of halfway along okay maybe

0:13:31.790,0:13:36.920,late 80s or so I started experimenting

0:13:34.430,0:13:39.200,with that and I liked it yeah I liked

0:13:36.920,0:13:42.530,having just a page there'd be a poem

0:13:39.200,0:13:44.150,going down one margin and then maybe

0:13:42.530,0:13:47.060,done another margin then across the

0:13:44.150,0:13:50.270,bottom something like that on one note

0:13:47.060,0:13:53.840,bondage on one page okay and then a lot

0:13:50.270,0:13:58.220,of times what would happen is I had I

0:13:53.840,0:14:00.950,didn't like one or two or all three of

0:13:58.220,0:14:03.080,them and eventually maybe just one of

0:14:00.950,0:14:10.820,those poems would kind of gel and then

0:14:03.080,0:14:12.950,get its own page okay yeah and and that

0:14:10.820,0:14:14.870,and then so is that could you put that

0:14:12.950,0:14:19.730,at a certain book or was that just sort

0:14:14.870,0:14:21.380,of gradual yeah I think I were I really

0:14:19.730,0:14:24.830,started experimenting with that was a

0:14:21.380,0:14:27.370,book called beside ourselves just maybe

0:14:24.830,0:14:30.110,kind of in a middle somewhere there yeah

0:14:27.370,0:14:32.780,yeah that was really awesome maybe the

0:14:30.110,0:14:36.110,first book that was more kind of

0:14:32.780,0:14:38.150,deliberate series yeah I think it's

0:14:36.110,0:14:40.790,because I think I can kind of figure out

0:14:38.150,0:14:44.570,where that happened Oh see that kind of

0:14:40.790,0:14:46.850,like yeah and then I liked I liked that

0:14:44.570,0:14:50.720,I liked working in series so much when I

0:14:46.850,0:14:53.600,was writing that book that I also just

0:14:50.720,0:14:54.320,decided that I wanted to keep moving in

0:14:53.600,0:14:56.990,that direction

0:14:54.320,0:14:59.360,I like the series poems okay doing those

0:14:56.990,0:15:01.510,yeah yeah and they maybe lent themselves

0:14:59.360,0:15:04.100,more to that kind of practice with

0:15:01.510,0:15:06.710,several poems kind of happening at the

0:15:04.100,0:15:10.940,same time in the early draft stages yeah

0:15:06.710,0:15:14.800,and then how is that different from your

0:15:10.940,0:15:14.800,fiction right uh-huh yeah

0:15:16.190,0:15:22.310,I don't really see a lot of similarities

0:15:19.610,0:15:23.990,between writing stories and writing

0:15:22.310,0:15:29.960,poems in terms of the drafting process

0:15:23.990,0:15:33.950,well in terms of okay stories are really

0:15:29.960,0:15:35.630,different um one of the first things I

0:15:33.950,0:15:39.050,learned about writing stories in the

0:15:35.630,0:15:42.680,drafting process was oh it kind of helps

0:15:39.050,0:15:45.410,to know a few things about what's gonna

0:15:42.680,0:15:47.480,happen in this story right not unlike a

0:15:45.410,0:15:48.970,poem where you're just kind of launching

0:15:47.480,0:15:52.070,into the unknown

0:15:48.970,0:15:55.970,it seemed helpful to have like a few

0:15:52.070,0:15:59.510,scenes in mind you know what some of the

0:15:55.970,0:16:04.220,lines of tension storylines kind of have

0:15:59.510,0:16:08.420,a few things yeah almost not an outline

0:16:04.220,0:16:11.060,but I often had would write down four or

0:16:08.420,0:16:13.670,five kind of sentences that would later

0:16:11.060,0:16:17.900,become scenes in and that would be like

0:16:13.670,0:16:21.200,on one page just to scrap a paper in the

0:16:17.900,0:16:22.580,car on driving okay and then I was then

0:16:21.200,0:16:23.960,do you grab those scraps of paper and

0:16:22.580,0:16:25.970,put them in the notebook does it become

0:16:23.960,0:16:28.880,like does it accumulate all your sort

0:16:25.970,0:16:31.010,all that sort of detritus of composition

0:16:28.880,0:16:39.410,well now once I write the scene I throw

0:16:31.010,0:16:41.780,the piece of paper but then I my process

0:16:39.410,0:16:45.470,in making the stories would be I write

0:16:41.780,0:16:49.280,like I try to write a scene a day or so

0:16:45.470,0:16:52.070,in the initial drafting phase I know I

0:16:49.280,0:16:54.230,just try to stay with that scene you

0:16:52.070,0:16:56.360,know blow out the edges often it's like

0:16:54.230,0:17:01.880,three times as long as what's gonna

0:16:56.360,0:17:03.589,actually be in the final story okay

0:17:01.880,0:17:06.620,usually compressing compressing

0:17:03.589,0:17:08.360,compressing but initially I just trying

0:17:06.620,0:17:13.250,to look around and see what's happening

0:17:08.360,0:17:15.620,in the periphery and just sort of stay

0:17:13.250,0:17:17.240,in once one scene at a time and I I

0:17:15.620,0:17:20.569,don't worry about the order I'm not

0:17:17.240,0:17:22.760,writing the first scene first I often

0:17:20.569,0:17:24.260,write start with the middle scene in

0:17:22.760,0:17:26.339,fact I kind of know I'm writing the

0:17:24.260,0:17:28.230,middle scene

0:17:26.339,0:17:32.309,then I just I move around in the

0:17:28.230,0:17:34.380,chronology of the story I because I you

0:17:32.309,0:17:36.179,know I have my little list yeah and

0:17:34.380,0:17:37.710,often when I'm working on one scene I'll

0:17:36.179,0:17:39.330,think of another scene and I just write

0:17:37.710,0:17:42.090,it on another piece of paper like just

0:17:39.330,0:17:44.850,again a sentence okay that'll is kind of

0:17:42.090,0:17:47.580,prompt yeah so I don't forget oh let's

0:17:44.850,0:17:49.950,have seen on this okay but so it they're

0:17:47.580,0:17:52.650,they're very the process is really

0:17:49.950,0:17:54.750,different it takes me I like when a

0:17:52.650,0:17:58.110,story is happening when I'm getting the

0:17:54.750,0:18:00.690,early draft comes really fast I hate it

0:17:58.110,0:18:05.130,I hate it I hate it because it takes all

0:18:00.690,0:18:07.830,my time I I've been known to cancel

0:18:05.130,0:18:15.390,classes I'm sick today I'm sorry I can't

0:18:07.830,0:18:17.490,connect today because I feel like I'm

0:18:15.390,0:18:19.529,gonna lose it okay so so when you said

0:18:17.490,0:18:21.450,it's it's happening it feels like like

0:18:19.529,0:18:22.470,it's it's come to you it's like I mean

0:18:21.450,0:18:26.640,that and it's not like an inspiration

0:18:22.470,0:18:29.520,but it's just like accumulation or so

0:18:26.640,0:18:31.770,much just going on you know I go out and

0:18:29.520,0:18:33.600,I take a walk every afternoon this

0:18:31.770,0:18:35.159,partner this is actually part of my

0:18:33.600,0:18:39.120,writing process to take a walk in the

0:18:35.159,0:18:41.460,afternoon and it's like shut up I'm just

0:18:39.120,0:18:46.320,trying to walk yeah but people are

0:18:41.460,0:18:48.200,talking in my head and um so it's just

0:18:46.320,0:18:50.970,it feels like it's just kind of this

0:18:48.200,0:18:54.630,overpowering thing when I'm working on a

0:18:50.970,0:18:56.730,story it just comes over me and it wakes

0:18:54.630,0:18:59.309,me up in the morning people wake me up

0:18:56.730,0:19:02.340,in the morning they are chattering away

0:18:59.309,0:19:07.620,is this it's very unnerving

0:19:02.340,0:19:10.950,yeah I often push back at a story until

0:19:07.620,0:19:13.020,I am really sure that I have you know

0:19:10.950,0:19:16.140,quite a few of the building blocks in

0:19:13.020,0:19:17.520,place because otherwise it's it just

0:19:16.140,0:19:21.240,seems like that struggle in a fight

0:19:17.520,0:19:23.640,mm-hmm and it's gonna occupy it takes it

0:19:21.240,0:19:28.260,takes me about 10 days of like 10 hour

0:19:23.640,0:19:30.870,days in a row 10 10 hour days it's for

0:19:28.260,0:19:33.899,one story for a story Wow and this is

0:19:30.870,0:19:38.370,all hand written - yes okay and it's

0:19:33.899,0:19:40.220,just no I mean I'm I guess you're

0:19:38.370,0:19:47.179,thinking and then you're writing down

0:19:40.220,0:19:50.659,yeah but the brain and then you know

0:19:47.179,0:19:52.880,it's so much because I don't I don't

0:19:50.659,0:19:54.500,know how other writers do this but

0:19:52.880,0:19:57.200,because I'm not writing the scenes in

0:19:54.500,0:20:00.200,order I'm kind of deliberately writing

0:19:57.200,0:20:02.299,them out of order mm-hmm just I write

0:20:00.200,0:20:04.850,the scene I see most clearly in my mind

0:20:02.299,0:20:07.789,first yeah and not worry about where

0:20:04.850,0:20:09.770,it's gonna go then and then I just put

0:20:07.789,0:20:13.610,the whole thing away for a long time

0:20:09.770,0:20:16.070,that initial yes of a draft and then

0:20:13.610,0:20:18.340,worry later about kind of arranging the

0:20:16.070,0:20:24.580,scenes I'm often moving things around

0:20:18.340,0:20:27.110,not based on when they happened but

0:20:24.580,0:20:31.820,what's more interesting to come next

0:20:27.110,0:20:33.500,okay and so when the were you studying

0:20:31.820,0:20:35.570,fiction as well as poetry in your

0:20:33.500,0:20:39.049,graduate school or did when did you

0:20:35.570,0:20:42.140,start to write these stories well I was

0:20:39.049,0:20:44.510,um I did take a fiction writing class in

0:20:42.140,0:20:47.659,grad school I was in I was in the poetry

0:20:44.510,0:20:49.520,group but we had to take a fiction class

0:20:47.659,0:20:52.460,and I was terrible okay

0:20:49.520,0:20:55.100,I was terrible at it because I didn't

0:20:52.460,0:20:59.929,have any sense of what made a story yeah

0:20:55.100,0:21:02.230,but when I started teaching especially

0:20:59.929,0:21:05.090,when I moved to Lake Forest College I

0:21:02.230,0:21:07.580,they thought well any poet can teach

0:21:05.090,0:21:10.520,fiction writing you know it's debatable

0:21:07.580,0:21:13.429,if we can get a fiction writer who can

0:21:10.520,0:21:16.490,teach poetry so they hired thinking you

0:21:13.429,0:21:19.700,know that I could figure it out so I

0:21:16.490,0:21:22.940,think I just accidentally taught myself

0:21:19.700,0:21:24.830,okay to write fiction by trying to help

0:21:22.940,0:21:28.400,my students make their stories better

0:21:24.830,0:21:31.370,and trying to diagnose you know what

0:21:28.400,0:21:36.710,does this story need I remember so many

0:21:31.370,0:21:38.539,days walking to my fiction writing class

0:21:36.710,0:21:41.120,and trying to think about what I was

0:21:38.539,0:21:43.909,gonna say to this writer about her story

0:21:41.120,0:21:47.740,you know how to you know to address its

0:21:43.909,0:21:51.890,troubles and I realized that I was

0:21:47.740,0:21:52.169,internalizing all this all this and then

0:21:51.890,0:21:55.070,the

0:21:52.169,0:21:58.769,first time I got a sabbatical um I

0:21:55.070,0:22:00.720,remember I was driving into Chicago on a

0:21:58.769,0:22:02.429,little for a little adventure for the

0:22:00.720,0:22:04.440,day and I was so happy I had the

0:22:02.429,0:22:07.499,sabbatical I was gonna work on poems of

0:22:04.440,0:22:11.039,course and I got this idea for a story

0:22:07.499,0:22:14.460,and I wrote I remember I was just

0:22:11.039,0:22:16.109,writing on my car supplying driving just

0:22:14.460,0:22:18.629,this little note to myself

0:22:16.109,0:22:20.850,about what the story kind of just a

0:22:18.629,0:22:23.159,synopsis like one sentence of what it

0:22:20.850,0:22:27.739,would be and by the time I got into

0:22:23.159,0:22:30.450,Chicago I had five story synopses

0:22:27.739,0:22:32.609,written on this piece of paper Wow and

0:22:30.450,0:22:35.519,then I just came home and that's what I

0:22:32.609,0:22:38.580,did from my own sabbatical I wrote a

0:22:35.519,0:22:40.230,bunch of stories and that was the first

0:22:38.580,0:22:42.690,book of stories limited lifetime

0:22:40.230,0:22:46.889,warranty oh god yeah

0:22:42.690,0:22:52.529,and what year was that oh my gosh I

0:22:46.889,0:22:56.809,think that was 83 years old okay and so

0:22:52.529,0:22:59.609,um with soda in this and so you've been

0:22:56.809,0:23:01.019,the story's kind of happened to you and

0:22:59.609,0:23:03.749,they've done they've been similar the

0:23:01.019,0:23:06.119,whole time the Newman writing have poems

0:23:03.749,0:23:08.519,in similar ways at like kind of come

0:23:06.119,0:23:10.259,upon you or is it a little bit more I

0:23:08.519,0:23:10.919,don't know is it a different process

0:23:10.259,0:23:14.129,than that

0:23:10.919,0:23:19.460,poems are more like a daily practice

0:23:14.129,0:23:19.460,with me I like I like poems they don't

0:23:21.200,0:23:29.759,for me they're more about sound and

0:23:24.139,0:23:34.619,imagery a voice who's talking in my

0:23:29.759,0:23:38.580,poems there's there often some some part

0:23:34.619,0:23:43.649,of me that I didn't really know was

0:23:38.580,0:23:46.369,there okay you know some aspect of

0:23:43.649,0:23:48.779,personality that I'm kind of exploring

0:23:46.369,0:23:51.960,yeah who use this language a different

0:23:48.779,0:23:56.850,way maybe than my ordinary daily life

0:23:51.960,0:24:01.739,self so I like I like that kind of quick

0:23:56.850,0:24:04.600,pop of a poem and yeah do you start

0:24:01.739,0:24:09.009,mostly with the line or an image or

0:24:04.600,0:24:15.690,is changer I like a line with an image

0:24:09.009,0:24:19.269,in it okay like one time I was writing

0:24:15.690,0:24:21.850,an article about Charles writes poetry I

0:24:19.269,0:24:23.679,really liked Charles Wright and I said

0:24:21.850,0:24:26.980,something in there in the review about

0:24:23.679,0:24:31.870,the hand of the image in the glove of

0:24:26.980,0:24:33.429,sound and I took that out oh and the

0:24:31.870,0:24:37.269,review because I thought it sound a

0:24:33.429,0:24:40.210,little precious or something but yeah

0:24:37.269,0:24:43.870,but for me I like that kind of they're

0:24:40.210,0:24:47.429,sort of in sorta indivisible right right

0:24:43.870,0:24:47.429,they come together yeah

0:24:50.250,0:24:56.259,but I'm I'm I remember talking to

0:24:53.590,0:24:57.850,Charles one time and I asked him a lot

0:24:56.259,0:24:59.889,of the same questions you're asking me

0:24:57.850,0:25:02.320,about a great composition because I'm

0:24:59.889,0:25:04.139,just like taking it back to the airport

0:25:02.320,0:25:06.610,after a reading I'm like plugging him

0:25:04.139,0:25:08.559,for everything he can tell me about how

0:25:06.610,0:25:12.070,he works and he says well you know after

0:25:08.559,0:25:17.230,I do three or four drafts then I I turn

0:25:12.070,0:25:19.809,it over to my ear okay yeah he said I

0:25:17.230,0:25:21.970,drive around town doing errands going to

0:25:19.809,0:25:23.980,the store stuff like that and I

0:25:21.970,0:25:26.919,memorized the pullman working on and

0:25:23.980,0:25:29.950,then I just start moving the words in

0:25:26.919,0:25:31.960,the lines around mm-hmm and then I start

0:25:29.950,0:25:33.850,moving the lines and the stanzas around

0:25:31.960,0:25:39.759,just kind of trying out I'm listening to

0:25:33.850,0:25:42.070,the sonic values I'm doing that so I

0:25:39.759,0:25:43.899,guess that's a good space to move on to

0:25:42.070,0:25:46.779,revision I mean so when you're revising

0:25:43.899,0:25:50.740,of home are you revising mostly by sound

0:25:46.779,0:25:56.309,or I mean like the sonic values is that

0:25:50.740,0:25:59.679,where are there different stages well

0:25:56.309,0:26:05.500,you know every poem just presents

0:25:59.679,0:26:07.389,different troubles to me I guess these

0:26:05.500,0:26:09.370,are some of the questions I have to ask

0:26:07.389,0:26:10.840,myself and this is just for me I don't

0:26:09.370,0:26:13.899,know that these would be other people's

0:26:10.840,0:26:16.870,problems by any means but I'm asking

0:26:13.899,0:26:20.470,myself who the heck is talking

0:26:16.870,0:26:23.490,who is this person because sometimes I

0:26:20.470,0:26:28.090,just and I mean that in a physical

0:26:23.490,0:26:31.120,literal way I have to see yeah I have to

0:26:28.090,0:26:35.350,see a figure almost you know maybe it's

0:26:31.120,0:26:37.000,me but it's me when I'm 12 or it's me

0:26:35.350,0:26:40.240,with big red hair

0:26:37.000,0:26:40.950,it's another so I'm asking who is this

0:26:40.240,0:26:44.860,person

0:26:40.950,0:26:52.720,where is she or he sometimes I think I'm

0:26:44.860,0:26:54.220,in a gender shift okay I like that

0:26:52.720,0:26:56.740,because I was a real tomboy it's a

0:26:54.220,0:26:58.929,little kid and I think I kind of

0:26:56.740,0:27:00.850,squashed that little tomboy down and he

0:26:58.929,0:27:02.169,likes to come back and say things once

0:27:00.850,0:27:08.590,in a while and he's a little bit of a

0:27:02.169,0:27:14.980,sassy snotty kid I like him um so who is

0:27:08.590,0:27:20.070,she where are we in the poem okay I need

0:27:14.980,0:27:24.149,to get located in time and space and

0:27:20.070,0:27:27.640,what the heck is going on like what

0:27:24.149,0:27:30.460,dramatically is happening in the poem

0:27:27.640,0:27:32.799,and a lot of times I'm you know I'll

0:27:30.460,0:27:38.140,have a fix on one or the other of these

0:27:32.799,0:27:39.970,questions but I'm really feeling unclear

0:27:38.140,0:27:43.000,about the other so I kind of know

0:27:39.970,0:27:45.450,questions to ask myself and that's what

0:27:43.000,0:27:47.890,I do in the really early stages of

0:27:45.450,0:27:50.980,drafting the poem and trying to figure

0:27:47.890,0:27:52.690,out the answers to some of those and how

0:27:50.980,0:27:54.390,do these questions then translate into

0:27:52.690,0:27:56.080,like into the basic physical

0:27:54.390,0:27:57.760,manifestation of your writing are you

0:27:56.080,0:28:00.760,are you still in your notebooks working

0:27:57.760,0:28:02.740,yes okay yes still in notebooks and are

0:28:00.760,0:28:05.350,you writing these questions in the pages

0:28:02.740,0:28:08.799,no no I'm just what I'm doing is I'm

0:28:05.350,0:28:10.029,just getting my imagination a chore okay

0:28:08.799,0:28:12.669,a task

0:28:10.029,0:28:14.860,I'm stir I'm staring into space and

0:28:12.669,0:28:17.320,trying to see like where is this at poor

0:28:14.860,0:28:20.860,is this unfolding we're trying to give

0:28:17.320,0:28:22.510,myself I'm so I'm interested in all this

0:28:20.860,0:28:24.820,material in the night let's write your

0:28:22.510,0:28:26.649,report but everything is also like you

0:28:24.820,0:28:28.810,know like it's like it happens so much

0:28:26.649,0:28:30.250,up here just happen it doesn't happen on

0:28:28.810,0:28:32.650,the page it doesn't happen it happens a

0:28:30.250,0:28:34.240,lot yeah just going to the store and

0:28:32.650,0:28:37.120,thinking about they listening to me your

0:28:34.240,0:28:39.570,own sounds which is another hard thing

0:28:37.120,0:28:42.880,to document or to sort of course yeah

0:28:39.570,0:28:44.500,and see none of this takes place what's

0:28:42.880,0:28:47.800,fiction with fiction you you're sort of

0:28:44.500,0:28:51.280,that got all that as you walk into the

0:28:47.800,0:28:52.990,first scene great great well then so so

0:28:51.280,0:28:54.880,what is your mode when you're revising a

0:28:52.990,0:28:58.380,story like how do you how do you work

0:28:54.880,0:29:01.630,through the drafts of the story well

0:28:58.380,0:29:05.350,with a story I'm really thinking a lot

0:29:01.630,0:29:07.270,more about why does this happen or why

0:29:05.350,0:29:10.690,did this happen

0:29:07.270,0:29:13.840,in the past tense ask myself a lot of

0:29:10.690,0:29:16.450,questions about motivation with the

0:29:13.840,0:29:19.720,characters and what their relationships

0:29:16.450,0:29:21.220,are like how did they get to this I'm

0:29:19.720,0:29:25.140,often trying to think about a little

0:29:21.220,0:29:27.310,some details of backstory you know again

0:29:25.140,0:29:32.380,you know all these things it's really

0:29:27.310,0:29:34.780,helped to have heard myself ask my

0:29:32.380,0:29:38.460,students these questions for the last 30

0:29:34.780,0:29:39.820,years yeah yeah they're kind of in there

0:29:38.460,0:29:43.540,yeah

0:29:39.820,0:29:47.770,the questions to ask yourself and but I

0:29:43.540,0:29:51.010,think what I'm mainly doing once I have

0:29:47.770,0:29:53.850,addressed some of these questions mainly

0:29:51.010,0:29:57.640,have to do with interior tea and

0:29:53.850,0:30:01.180,psychology of the people is in revision

0:29:57.640,0:30:04.090,I'm just trying to get the story to move

0:30:01.180,0:30:08.200,along I am really paying most attention

0:30:04.090,0:30:11.260,to the pace and I think in that regard

0:30:08.200,0:30:15.130,now poetry and fiction maybe have a

0:30:11.260,0:30:18.070,little more similarities when you get to

0:30:15.130,0:30:20.470,that stage of revision where you're

0:30:18.070,0:30:22.510,starting to really start to tighten yeah

0:30:20.470,0:30:23.740,are we there now is that we're talking

0:30:22.510,0:30:31.840,about no yeah absolutely

0:30:23.740,0:30:36.220,okay yeah so then with the poem I slash

0:30:31.840,0:30:38.860,mercilessly I'm a slasher yeah and I

0:30:36.220,0:30:41.290,move things around but often when I'm

0:30:38.860,0:30:43.159,moving around is you know I've got too

0:30:41.290,0:30:46.529,many lines

0:30:43.159,0:30:49.230,the landscape all in a row here I've got

0:30:46.529,0:30:51.659,ten lines about the freaking place where

0:30:49.230,0:30:54.120,we are these that sports but I sometimes

0:30:51.659,0:30:56.610,I won't cut them I'll just take four of

0:30:54.120,0:31:00.120,them and put them in a different place

0:30:56.610,0:31:03.600,and I don't worry too much about like hi

0:31:00.120,0:31:06.240,get back there cuz that's easy okay to

0:31:03.600,0:31:08.070,do later and same in fiction what I'm

0:31:06.240,0:31:11.519,I'm really thinking about pacing I'm

0:31:08.070,0:31:15.630,thinking about um you know like the

0:31:11.519,0:31:18.510,opening of a story I'll just start with

0:31:15.630,0:31:21.000,the scene that we're gonna catch back up

0:31:18.510,0:31:22.710,to in the middle mm-hmm but because it's

0:31:21.000,0:31:24.360,got some interest I think interesting

0:31:22.710,0:31:26.250,dialogue or something interesting is

0:31:24.360,0:31:27.809,going on with the characters yeah I'm

0:31:26.250,0:31:30.929,gonna start there and then circle back

0:31:27.809,0:31:33.240,and then catch back up to it midway

0:31:30.929,0:31:36.809,through the story oh here's where that's

0:31:33.240,0:31:38.880,a cups that's typical for me to UM move

0:31:36.809,0:31:40.649,around like that so I'm just going okay

0:31:38.880,0:31:42.630,we've got a scene a dialogue now we're

0:31:40.649,0:31:43.289,gonna have you know how did this all

0:31:42.630,0:31:45.929,start

0:31:43.289,0:31:48.360,now we're gonna have scene where we've

0:31:45.929,0:31:50.039,got some dream or some thinking now

0:31:48.360,0:31:53.610,we're going to go back to dialogue so

0:31:50.039,0:31:58.500,I'm just kind of having some syncopation

0:31:53.610,0:31:59.880,of pacing things and that kind of

0:31:58.500,0:32:01.409,happens throughout your books too right

0:31:59.880,0:32:02.850,now he's not only within the story room

0:32:01.409,0:32:07.169,within a collection of stories there's

0:32:02.850,0:32:08.940,sort of that same the repetition of

0:32:07.169,0:32:10.769,images repetitions of the scenes or

0:32:08.940,0:32:13.080,knots not repetition but like a kind of

0:32:10.769,0:32:14.929,allusions to the same place in in time

0:32:13.080,0:32:17.250,and in space

0:32:14.929,0:32:18.779,so I guess is that when you're when

0:32:17.250,0:32:20.490,you're revising the entire book is that

0:32:18.779,0:32:23.100,when you're putting together the book

0:32:20.490,0:32:27.750,itself is that also happening yes okay

0:32:23.100,0:32:34.049,okay so have these modes of revision

0:32:27.750,0:32:35.940,that sort of focus on pacing and moving

0:32:34.049,0:32:37.260,around and changes have these changed

0:32:35.940,0:32:38.730,over the course of your career I mean

0:32:37.260,0:32:40.470,did you like when you were first

0:32:38.730,0:32:42.720,starting out writing did you have to

0:32:40.470,0:32:43.289,come to this kind of way of revising or

0:32:42.720,0:32:44.880,it did it

0:32:43.289,0:32:48.929,what did it just sort of was it there

0:32:44.880,0:32:52.200,from the beginning no it's been a slow

0:32:48.929,0:32:53.380,gradual process okay and in the

0:32:52.200,0:32:55.810,beginning was was there

0:32:53.380,0:32:57.550,different kind of was it more you know

0:32:55.810,0:33:01.180,were you doing it more by-the-book kind

0:32:57.550,0:33:04.540,of so to speak or was it oh gosh I don't

0:33:01.180,0:33:06.820,I don't know how I was doing anything at

0:33:04.540,0:33:09.070,the beginning I know you know what my

0:33:06.820,0:33:13.330,first book of poems I had help

0:33:09.070,0:33:15.340,I've never had an editor again yeah like

0:33:13.330,0:33:16.840,I had with that very first book Larry

0:33:15.340,0:33:18.510,Lieberman at University of Illinois

0:33:16.840,0:33:21.880,press

0:33:18.510,0:33:25.120,he weeded out some of the weaker poems

0:33:21.880,0:33:28.050,but also helped me to shape up some new

0:33:25.120,0:33:30.880,things I was working on and put them in

0:33:28.050,0:33:32.710,help me with the arrangement and you

0:33:30.880,0:33:35.380,know I've never had help like that again

0:33:32.710,0:33:37.560,but that was very instructive yeah to me

0:33:35.380,0:33:40.420,you too he would write me these

0:33:37.560,0:33:42.190,interesting letters worried you would

0:33:40.420,0:33:44.740,explain you know why he thought this

0:33:42.190,0:33:47.910,article here and this go there and this

0:33:44.740,0:33:51.040,stanza needed to be gone this was stupid

0:33:47.910,0:33:54.970,it was just so helpful to have somebody

0:33:51.040,0:33:58.030,be such a close reader with me again

0:33:54.970,0:33:59.440,ever so so do do people play a role in

0:33:58.030,0:34:02.500,your revision process now or is it

0:33:59.440,0:34:04.420,pretty much just you um well my husband

0:34:02.500,0:34:07.440,reads everything and he's some really

0:34:04.420,0:34:11.590,really tough critic really really tough

0:34:07.440,0:34:15.970,it's very good but he's I think he's

0:34:11.590,0:34:20.129,smart reader and he also kind of knows

0:34:15.970,0:34:25.330,what I'm capable of and if I don't

0:34:20.129,0:34:27.610,measure up he'll tell me yeah so you

0:34:25.330,0:34:33.790,don't you're not corresponding with

0:34:27.610,0:34:35.740,other writers with I have a couple of

0:34:33.790,0:34:41.050,good fiction writer friends that I have

0:34:35.740,0:34:45.129,shared work with an early another a

0:34:41.050,0:34:48.639,novel I had a two book contract with

0:34:45.129,0:34:50.800,this the book of stories before this one

0:34:48.639,0:34:53.350,and they wanted the second thing to be a

0:34:50.800,0:34:55.290,novel publisher I told you who decided

0:34:53.350,0:34:57.790,they were going to quit write fiction

0:34:55.290,0:35:01.360,and they wanted the second book to be a

0:34:57.790,0:35:05.340,novel so I I tried three times to write

0:35:01.360,0:35:09.330,a novel and I got two hundred pages in

0:35:05.340,0:35:11.160,three times yeah and I showed a couple

0:35:09.330,0:35:15.330,of those books to friends who are

0:35:11.160,0:35:18.720,fiction writers and they they confirmed

0:35:15.330,0:35:21.660,for me that what I thought was true the

0:35:18.720,0:35:26.520,way I could phrase it to myself is they

0:35:21.660,0:35:30.150,didn't have a big enough engine I like

0:35:26.520,0:35:33.300,short stories I'm at the go-kart

0:35:30.150,0:35:37.410,I like short stories

0:35:33.300,0:35:39.300
- I was struck though in quake right but

0:35:37.410,0:35:41.280,like I I was reading that and I thought

0:35:39.300,0:35:43.020,it was I mean it read to me and felt to

0:35:41.280,0:35:47.040,me a lot like the way that Jennifer

0:35:43.020,0:35:49.890,Egan's you know separate stories but all

0:35:47.040,0:35:53.070,kind of like investigating certain kind

0:35:49.890,0:35:58.740,of dilemmas and and an interesting kind

0:35:53.070,0:36:00.720,of metaphor or metaphysical ideas yeah

0:35:58.740,0:36:02.010,yeah but I was like well I mean like

0:36:00.720,0:36:03.240,what if she called this and not I mean I

0:36:02.010,0:36:06.360,just was wondering you know be like it's

0:36:03.240,0:36:08.070,not anyway this is very arbitrary but it

0:36:06.360,0:36:10.230,seems like you compose them very much

0:36:08.070,0:36:12.060,kind of separately I mean but they are

0:36:10.230,0:36:14.220,related right I mean lately yeah they're

0:36:12.060,0:36:16.830,linked stories yeah they've all been

0:36:14.220,0:36:19.050,linked yeah I really I love all the

0:36:16.830,0:36:22.920,different possibilities of ways to link

0:36:19.050,0:36:26.610,stories okay but in terms of the engine

0:36:22.920,0:36:29.490,yeah I like a little small engine that I

0:36:26.610,0:36:33.840,feel like I can I can fix what's wrong

0:36:29.490,0:36:36.930,with a little small engine and I don't

0:36:33.840,0:36:39.270,know if I could the the novel thing is

0:36:36.930,0:36:42.990,it's kind of overwhelming for me to

0:36:39.270,0:36:45.540,think about yeah how much you have to

0:36:42.990,0:36:49.950,sustain how much should have how much

0:36:45.540,0:36:52.140,needs to drive a big and I love novels I

0:36:49.950,0:36:57.330,love reading them but yeah I'm

0:36:52.140,0:36:59.670,intimidated by the arc how huge it needs

0:36:57.330,0:37:05.970,to be and how much maybe you need to

0:36:59.670,0:37:07.680,know before you sit down right do your

0:37:05.970,0:37:11.460,does your writing entail any sort of

0:37:07.680,0:37:14.130,research or story yeah like quake was a

0:37:11.460,0:37:16.200,good example I'm doing all that research

0:37:14.130,0:37:19.080,on the gypsy culture in the country I

0:37:16.200,0:37:21.480,just loved it oh yeah and that just

0:37:19.080,0:37:23.400,really fed my stories when I was working

0:37:21.480,0:37:26.310,on it and this new book that has the

0:37:23.400,0:37:31.560,dinosaur dick in it that was really fun

0:37:26.310,0:37:33.320,we my husband I went okay Montana that's

0:37:31.560,0:37:36.870,part of the research for that was fun

0:37:33.320,0:37:38.460,they just have that like dinosaur vs.

0:37:36.870,0:37:40.380,dinosaur discovery or something this

0:37:38.460,0:37:42.450,summer did you see this yeah it was like

0:37:40.380,0:37:46.430,some private investor private digger

0:37:42.450,0:37:48.810,found these like perfectly preserved

0:37:46.430,0:37:50.820,fossils of like a Tyrannosaurus Rex

0:37:48.810,0:37:52.080,working like a Stegosaurus like right

0:37:50.820,0:37:54.210,next to somebody must tell guys like

0:37:52.080,0:37:55.680,mid-fight and so they sold it like

0:37:54.210,0:37:56.850,instead of giving me the Smithsonian

0:37:55.680,0:37:58.710,they sold it at auction for some

0:37:56.850,0:38:00.360,ridiculous price really and it was sort

0:37:58.710,0:38:02.550,of a debate about that just like a

0:38:00.360,0:38:05.520,couple of femurs or something a couple

0:38:02.550,0:38:08.460,of I know the hole it was like it was

0:38:05.520,0:38:12.450,just like like an insane find in

0:38:08.460,0:38:15.030,Montana's you know well what I

0:38:12.450,0:38:16.860,understood was that um this is pertain

0:38:15.030,0:38:21.030,to your thing but what I heard was that

0:38:16.860,0:38:23.760,um all those glacial floods

0:38:21.030,0:38:27.780,what happened and they basically wash

0:38:23.760,0:38:30.870,all these bones over and saw there be

0:38:27.780,0:38:32.610,like this giant own bed of you know 20

0:38:30.870,0:38:34.530,different species but just because

0:38:32.610,0:38:46.050,they've been washed by the floods like

0:38:34.530,0:38:47.190,that yeah up the same place I guess then

0:38:46.050,0:38:50.160,what a couple more questions about

0:38:47.190,0:38:51.300,revision but and then so I guess one of

0:38:50.160,0:38:52.950,the like I've been reading this book

0:38:51.300,0:38:54.540,called the work of revision which is a

0:38:52.950,0:38:55.620,really interesting book kind of tracing

0:38:54.540,0:38:57.090,the history and revision for my

0:38:55.620,0:38:59.550,romantics up through the modernist

0:38:57.090,0:39:03.480,period and then kind of how textual

0:38:59.550,0:39:04.830,critisism works with it but and she was

0:39:03.480,0:39:06.450,sort of her name's Hannah Sullivan wrote

0:39:04.830,0:39:09.570,it and she was sort of delineating kind

0:39:06.450,0:39:11.760,of three modes of revision one being a

0:39:09.570,0:39:13.440,creative like joyce adding all this

0:39:11.760,0:39:17.160,stuff to Ithaca and the other parts of

0:39:13.440,0:39:19.350,Ulysses and then the sort of excited for

0:39:17.160,0:39:21.090,subtractive way that you seem to do and

0:39:19.350,0:39:22.710,then there's that sort of substitution

0:39:21.090,0:39:24.690,and I'm wondering is there a primary

0:39:22.710,0:39:29.450,mode between those three that you use

0:39:24.690,0:39:29.450,for your revision or is it a combination

0:39:29.880,0:39:39.560,hmm I would say I I really kind of start

0:39:34.470,0:39:42.150,with the excretion first yeah and then

0:39:39.560,0:39:45.690,go into the subtraction and then

0:39:42.150,0:39:48.410,probably this substitution is like the

0:39:45.690,0:39:50.580,tinkering I do at the very end okay and

0:39:48.410,0:39:52.590,physically weird where did these

0:39:50.580,0:39:54.210,processes happen I mean like when you're

0:39:52.590,0:39:56.670,taking something away is that happening

0:39:54.210,0:39:59.600,in the notebook where does that happen

0:39:56.670,0:40:05.250,on the computer or they have both spaces

0:39:59.600,0:40:08.000,usually I've excised much of what I'm

0:40:05.250,0:40:10.800,gonna take out before I type it up okay

0:40:08.000,0:40:14.370,so I probably as I said I'll probably do

0:40:10.800,0:40:17.340,two or three handwritten drafts and I'll

0:40:14.370,0:40:20.700,rip actually rip the notebook page out

0:40:17.340,0:40:22.950,or and I have notebooks and notebooks

0:40:20.700,0:40:26.160,where I have a big X through the page to

0:40:22.950,0:40:27.780,so that I do not get confused that I'm

0:40:26.160,0:40:30.300,actually done with this version now

0:40:27.780,0:40:32.010,there's a if I look hard enough in the

0:40:30.300,0:40:34.560,notebook there is a later version of

0:40:32.010,0:40:36.570,those pause but I saw I throw the old

0:40:34.560,0:40:37.020,ripped out pages in the back of the

0:40:36.570,0:40:40.620,notebook

0:40:37.020,0:40:44.780,and there's a newer version somewhere in

0:40:40.620,0:40:47.100,there but the older ones are fatter and

0:40:44.780,0:40:49.820,often you know I'm also you know

0:40:47.100,0:40:54.560,experimenting with line break than to

0:40:49.820,0:40:59.670,you know what the shape shaping issues

0:40:54.560,0:41:02.760,and and so you're doing that in the

0:40:59.670,0:41:05.280,notebook still so and then I feel like

0:41:02.760,0:41:07.680,when I move it to the computer I'm sort

0:41:05.280,0:41:10.140,of getting to a place where I want to

0:41:07.680,0:41:11.730,look at it there's something I'm sure

0:41:10.140,0:41:14.370,you're gonna hear this with lots of

0:41:11.730,0:41:17.070,writers my age that there's something

0:41:14.370,0:41:22.050,about when you type it up that starts to

0:41:17.070,0:41:25.020,make it look permanent mm-hmm

0:41:22.050,0:41:30.120,especially for me in terms of the shape

0:41:25.020,0:41:35.580,of the poem the the line lengths

0:41:30.120,0:41:38.400,especially in a poem I I'm less inclined

0:41:35.580,0:41:43.380,to fiddle with line lengths once I've got

0:41:38.400,0:41:45.180,it on the on the computer I do that I

0:41:43.380,0:41:47.130,for some reason it still feels easier

0:41:45.180,0:41:51.840,for me to do it on the page because I

0:41:47.130,0:41:53.760,can just stick my slashes in there oh so

0:41:51.840,0:41:56.850,once they're actually broken into lines

0:41:53.760,0:41:58.530,on the computer then that seam do you

0:41:56.850,0:42:02.040,don't feel like you still have that

0:41:58.530,0:42:04.110,freedom - well I do I do i do

0:42:02.040,0:42:08.250,experimenter you know something I'll go

0:42:04.110,0:42:11.490,oh this is 15 lines that so close to us

0:42:08.250,0:42:15.870,on it I don't know help it along you

0:42:11.490,0:42:20.210,know so then feel like there should be

0:42:15.870,0:42:20.210,like another term for a 15-month yeah

0:42:20.900,0:42:31.170,okay so and then at that point are that

0:42:25.560,0:42:33.320,poems ordered into the way you okay so

0:42:31.170,0:42:37.130,how is that what's that process like oh

0:42:33.320,0:42:40.920,that's just another process of just

0:42:37.130,0:42:46.230,printing out all the poems and then just

0:42:40.920,0:42:50.400,living with them and that takes I don't

0:42:46.230,0:42:54.830,know maybe a year - mm-hmm maybe even

0:42:50.400,0:42:58.980,longer sometimes of experimenting with

0:42:54.830,0:43:00.540,sections you know the arrangement I'm

0:42:58.980,0:43:05.340,working right now on a book of prose

0:43:00.540,0:43:10.290,poems and I'm just really struggling

0:43:05.340,0:43:14.730,with what's what's even gonna be in this

0:43:10.290,0:43:17.250,book sorting so there's there's a number

0:43:14.730,0:43:19.110,so once you get to the computer are you

0:43:17.250,0:43:21.870,putting like all the poems from one

0:43:19.110,0:43:25.380,notebook in one word file say or are you

0:43:21.870,0:43:29.930,putting them individually no I don't put

0:43:25.380,0:43:33.480,I each Palmas it's on file okay until I

0:43:29.930,0:43:36.930,really start to make the book as a book

0:43:33.480,0:43:38.700,okay and so you and then like so just

0:43:36.930,0:43:40.650,technically then you call that file

0:43:38.700,0:43:43.110,whatever the title of the poem is yeah

0:43:40.650,0:43:49.560,and then save it same in a folder with

0:43:43.110,0:43:52.140,my folder is called poems oh yeah and

0:43:49.560,0:43:54.600,there are some subfolders in there like

0:43:52.140,0:43:55.950,okay for a book would you make a

0:43:54.600,0:43:58.200,subfolder

0:43:55.950,0:44:01.350,well then each book gets its own file

0:43:58.200,0:44:02.910,then okay yeah okay but it's so the the

0:44:01.350,0:44:05.160,poems are kind of in one big folder and

0:44:02.910,0:44:07.410,then as they get into a book then it'll

0:44:05.160,0:44:09.660,be 1/5 exactly and if they when they get

0:44:07.410,0:44:12.390,published then I put them in another

0:44:09.660,0:44:14.820,file called published poems okay so I

0:44:12.390,0:44:18.120,don't care don't get confused and not

0:44:14.820,0:44:19.830,sending stuff yeah still yeah and then

0:44:18.120,0:44:25.800,there's some alt you know I have filed

0:44:19.830,0:44:30.000,called files called poems oh eight right

0:44:25.800,0:44:31.710,um that are just like I'm never gonna

0:44:30.000,0:44:33.600,probably do anything with them now but

0:44:31.710,0:44:36.510,they're still sitting there they're

0:44:33.600,0:44:39.210,still in there somewhere okay and is

0:44:36.510,0:44:40.940,that the same that same sort of transfer

0:44:39.210,0:44:48.270,happened with fiction too

0:44:40.940,0:44:54.800,um yeah I mean I've got a file in there

0:44:48.270,0:44:56.850,just called stories in process and I

0:44:54.800,0:45:03.750,don't know if they're gonna be a book

0:44:56.850,0:45:05.190,sort of yeah and so well we'll get back

0:45:03.750,0:45:07.350,to the computer stuff a little bit more

0:45:05.190,0:45:08.970,let me just sort of talk a little bit we

0:45:07.350,0:45:11.220,move from revision and talk a little bit

0:45:08.970,0:45:12.780,more about kind of organizational and

0:45:11.220,0:45:20.370,this is we were already kind of talking

0:45:12.780,0:45:24.240,about it these things all mesh in but so

0:45:20.370,0:45:25.920,I mean well okay that with the computer

0:45:24.240,0:45:27.750,then you know you move from in your

0:45:25.920,0:45:29.190,notebook and then you type it up and is

0:45:27.750,0:45:31.620,that that's sort of a moment of revision

0:45:29.190,0:45:33.090,for you too mm-hm and then you have

0:45:31.620,0:45:35.550,several other different moments of

0:45:33.090,0:45:36.870,revision when it's on the computer but

0:45:35.550,0:45:39.990,some of those happen in paper because

0:45:36.870,0:45:42.390,you create them out right and then that

0:45:39.990,0:45:47.370,arrangement happens physically usually

0:45:42.390,0:45:51.150,first um oh look I'll look at it on I'll

0:45:47.370,0:45:52.620,come back to it over a period of I don't

0:45:51.150,0:45:55.440,know a couple of weeks on the computer

0:45:52.620,0:45:57.780,then once it's in a computer file and

0:45:55.440,0:45:59.430,look at it probably tinker with it a

0:45:57.780,0:46:02.340,little bit more before and then I'll

0:45:59.430,0:46:05.640,start sending it out probably so fairly

0:46:02.340,0:46:08.120,soon after I type it up maybe a month

0:46:05.640,0:46:10.620,two months yeah

0:46:08.120,0:46:11.790,so I there comes the point where I feel

0:46:10.620,0:46:14.640,like I'm making it worse

0:46:11.790,0:46:16.530,yeah yeah my tinkering is starting make

0:46:14.640,0:46:20.360,it worse that's the only thing that

0:46:16.530,0:46:30.060,stops me and then I start sending it out

0:46:20.360,0:46:32.340,and individual poems yeah and then if it

0:46:30.060,0:46:33.810,comes back rejected often I'll take her

0:46:32.340,0:46:37.230,a little bit more and send it back out

0:46:33.810,0:46:39.780,again in a week okay so you use the sort

0:46:37.230,0:46:45.080,of publication and submission process as

0:46:39.780,0:46:45.080,a sort of revision prompt or I do okay

0:46:45.950,0:46:52.020,and then so okay then they come together

0:46:49.200,0:46:54.300,in one file as your book thing and then

0:46:52.020,0:46:56.160,you send that out to publishers and is

0:46:54.300,0:46:58.290,that the similar sort of thing if you if

0:46:56.160,0:47:00.210,it's rejected to you then revise again

0:46:58.290,0:47:01.740,or is that sort of once it's in that

0:47:00.210,0:47:04.880,file once you've got it there you just

0:47:01.740,0:47:10.410,sort of want to give it give it a space

0:47:04.880,0:47:13.730,I'll probably revise it a little bit

0:47:10.410,0:47:19.500,more if it comes back rejected but

0:47:13.730,0:47:21.870,usually once it gets in book form yeah

0:47:19.500,0:47:25.400,but it seems sort of settled to me and

0:47:21.870,0:47:28.380,often that this maybe is also the case

0:47:25.400,0:47:32.390,the reason for that being that I've

0:47:28.380,0:47:32.390,probably moved on to another book okay

0:47:35.060,0:47:39.960,and now i'm i'm ashleigh compiling

0:47:37.950,0:47:44.790,another book or at that point when i

0:47:39.960,0:47:47.160,start sending one out so how many books

0:47:44.790,0:47:49.470,do you usually have going or how many

0:47:47.160,0:47:51.750,projects at one time do you usually have

0:47:49.470,0:47:54.450,going well I almost always have a book

0:47:51.750,0:47:56.040,of poems yeah in process that I'm

0:47:54.450,0:47:58.770,working on like I said right now I'm

0:47:56.040,0:48:02.490,working trying to shape up this book of

0:47:58.770,0:48:04.920,prose poems and then I almost always

0:48:02.490,0:48:08.580,have a book of fiction that's sort of in

0:48:04.920,0:48:14.790,process right now I'm working on a ebook

0:48:08.580,0:48:17.100,novel novella thing and and then you

0:48:14.790,0:48:19.320,know I'm doing the photos now so in

0:48:17.100,0:48:21.150,terms of like publishing individual

0:48:19.320,0:48:26.819,pieces now I'm really

0:48:21.150,0:48:28.470,doing those a lot okay and then so in

0:48:26.819,0:48:31.079,terms of just sort of saving and

0:48:28.470,0:48:32.099,archiving your work you you we didn't we

0:48:31.079,0:48:34.799,talked a little bit about this you keep

0:48:32.099,0:48:37.680,your notebooks basically in boxes on the

0:48:34.799,0:48:39.720,shelves and then your files are in a

0:48:37.680,0:48:40.980,folder and they just stay in the same

0:48:39.720,0:48:44.700,folder and then you put them to an

0:48:40.980,0:48:47.400,external drive given point is there any

0:48:44.700,0:48:48.960,other kind of archival or or backup

0:48:47.400,0:48:56.880,procedures that you go through for your

0:48:48.960,0:48:59.579,work or is that pretty much yes I guess

0:48:56.880,0:49:05.819,that's pretty much it I mean my

0:48:59.579,0:49:08.970,publishers I think have copies you know

0:49:05.819,0:49:12.839,they have PDFs yeah of everything right

0:49:08.970,0:49:15.990,great so you rely on them I rely on them

0:49:12.839,0:49:24.359,okay that those are not going to go away

0:49:15.990,0:49:27.960,sure I don't cuz that's what they send

0:49:24.359,0:49:30.990,me to proof no yes yeah okay and they

0:49:27.960,0:49:35.520,used to send you galleys or or pretty it

0:49:30.990,0:49:37.109,up yeah and where though do you do much

0:49:35.520,0:49:40.010,revision at that stage it's not that

0:49:37.109,0:49:44.430,more title one is irritating yeah yeah

0:49:40.010,0:49:45.750,okay so then I guess one question more

0:49:44.430,0:49:49.349,and then when I talk kind of about

0:49:45.750,0:49:51.660,computer specifically but you see kind

0:49:49.349,0:49:53.039,of in this talking that is there was

0:49:51.660,0:49:54.690,there sort of can you kind of delineate

0:49:53.039,0:49:56.460,stages in your own writing over the

0:49:54.690,0:49:58.410,course of your you know the years of

0:49:56.460,0:50:00.930,human writing so professionally do you

0:49:58.410,0:50:07.410,see distinct stages or do you think it's

0:50:00.930,0:50:09.710,just been kind of a gradual you mean

0:50:07.410,0:50:12.000,that's where things have just changed

0:50:09.710,0:50:13.380,dramatically or like you know they could

0:50:12.000,0:50:15.240,have changed over like a couple years

0:50:13.380,0:50:16.559,but I mean could you kind would you say

0:50:15.240,0:50:18.569,there are stages or would you just see

0:50:16.559,0:50:20.400,it kind of and if there were anything

0:50:18.569,0:50:22.140,that kind of prompted some changes what

0:50:20.400,0:50:25.559,were those I guess is where I'm kind of

0:50:22.140,0:50:30.890,going with this well I think it's mostly

0:50:25.559,0:50:34.700,been gradual that I've I've grown more

0:50:30.890,0:50:38.910,comfortable doing some revision work on

0:50:34.700,0:50:41.340,computer and especially with the fiction

0:50:38.910,0:50:47.580,and maybe because fiction is still feels

0:50:41.340,0:50:50.280,like a newer form to me one shift that

0:50:47.580,0:50:55.170,has felt a little bit more dramatic

0:50:50.280,0:50:58.620,what composing is that I have found

0:50:55.170,0:51:04.200,myself when I'm working on short stories

0:50:58.620,0:51:06.660,actually doing some new composing work

0:51:04.200,0:51:11.130,right here while I'm sitting there like

0:51:06.660,0:51:15.540,out I'll be working on a story you know

0:51:11.130,0:51:19.950,thinking I'm typing in from my notebook

0:51:15.540,0:51:24.180,and actually I remember working on this

0:51:19.950,0:51:27.710,one story and I had written something a

0:51:24.180,0:51:31.770,note to myself in my notebook that said

0:51:27.710,0:51:33.330,flesh out her dream right here and I had

0:51:31.770,0:51:38.430,forgotten to do that so I remember

0:51:33.330,0:51:40.950,sitting here doing it while I was typing

0:51:38.430,0:51:45.600,in the story on the into my word file

0:51:40.950,0:51:48.840,and I thought what I wrote was okay yeah

0:51:45.600,0:51:52.230,it sort of freed me up then to do that

0:51:48.840,0:51:55.680,more frequently to let myself do some of

0:51:52.230,0:51:58.770,the initial composing although I still

0:51:55.680,0:52:00.510,kind of like have a little cue that what

0:51:58.770,0:52:03.780,it's gonna be you know like there's a

0:52:00.510,0:52:05.730,little hole that I forgot to do or and I

0:52:03.780,0:52:10.350,have a note to myself in the notebook

0:52:05.730,0:52:12.980,okay so do that I guess how does what's

0:52:10.350,0:52:14.880,the difference and feel between like

0:52:12.980,0:52:16.800,Dario discriminators writing with

0:52:14.880,0:52:20.570,two-handed writing versus one hit yeah

0:52:16.800,0:52:23.850,well one of the things that I like about

0:52:20.570,0:52:29.640,doing it on the computer is I can close

0:52:23.850,0:52:35.000,my eyes which is really odd but I like

0:52:29.640,0:52:38.070,it and so it seems to lend itself to

0:52:35.000,0:52:40.880,this may sound weird not to dialogue or

0:52:38.070,0:52:44.400,action but to real kind of interior

0:52:40.880,0:52:45.550,moments where I'm in a character's mind

0:52:44.400,0:52:48.380,and I want

0:52:45.550,0:52:50.030,replicator thinking process like I said

0:52:48.380,0:52:52.660,what the first time I ever tried it was

0:52:50.030,0:52:55.730,where I kind of tried to render a dream

0:52:52.660,0:52:57.800,but the character had had so I closed my

0:52:55.730,0:53:00.170,eyes you know of course we can type with

0:52:57.800,0:53:10.100,her eyes closed right but I can't write

0:53:00.170,0:53:12.950,with my eyes closed okay okay

0:53:10.100,0:53:16.220,so then in terms of computers generally

0:53:12.950,0:53:19.820,when did you when did they enter into

0:53:16.220,0:53:21.680,your writing process well when I

0:53:19.820,0:53:23.030,remember when I moved to Lake Forest

0:53:21.680,0:53:24.350,College and you were gonna ask me this

0:53:23.030,0:53:28.869,so I was trying to think about this the

0:53:24.350,0:53:32.330,other day we got these I wish I could

0:53:28.869,0:53:34.660,tape rose tape Rose okay

0:53:32.330,0:53:39.800,have you heard of those no oh my god

0:53:34.660,0:53:42.710,they were these huge gray boxes uh-huh

0:53:39.800,0:53:50.500,and they were given to us this must have

0:53:42.710,0:53:53.270,been 1980 okay right around there 1980

0:53:50.500,0:53:55.930,at Lake Forest College all the faculty

0:53:53.270,0:53:59.140,got these k-pro computer things and

0:53:55.930,0:54:03.800,really all they did was word processing

0:53:59.140,0:54:05.450,so but yeah I liked him I remember a lot

0:54:03.800,0:54:08.960,of the faculty were complaining but I

0:54:05.450,0:54:11.810,really you know cuz I was moving from I

0:54:08.960,0:54:14.930,like a Selectric typewriter or something

0:54:11.810,0:54:17.180,okay and this machine was so much easier

0:54:14.930,0:54:20.720,to do corrections and everything yeah

0:54:17.180,0:54:23.960,and so I took to the computer right away

0:54:20.720,0:54:26.990,I really liked it in 1980 yeah Wow okay

0:54:23.960,0:54:28.700,that's very early I think well I can't

0:54:26.990,0:54:31.310,remember the excessive summer I mean you

0:54:28.700,0:54:33.320,started teaching in Lake Forest in 79

0:54:31.310,0:54:35.480,so it was right around there when we

0:54:33.320,0:54:37.640,first moved there yeah and that's all

0:54:35.480,0:54:39.920,they did they didn't do there was no

0:54:37.640,0:54:45.160,internet right yeah so you were just

0:54:39.920,0:54:45.160,just word processing again did this

0:54:45.550,0:54:50.300,well the advent of this computer and

0:54:48.230,0:54:52.160,then maybe like the kind of chain more

0:54:50.300,0:54:54.080,prevalence of computers kind of changed

0:54:52.160,0:54:58.529,your writing practices pretty

0:54:54.080,0:55:02.140,drastically eventually or well

0:54:58.529,0:55:07.240,the you know the academic world I don't

0:55:02.140,0:55:10.900,know if I hadn't been in the Academy if

0:55:07.240,0:55:13.450,I would be have the same relationship

0:55:10.900,0:55:15.640,with technology as I do because

0:55:13.450,0:55:17.140,everywhere I went to teach I was

0:55:15.640,0:55:20.740,presented with a new computer when I

0:55:17.140,0:55:21.609,walked in the door and yeah and it's

0:55:20.740,0:55:28.170,nice yeah

0:55:21.609,0:55:31.299,because you know Apple made its money by

0:55:28.170,0:55:33.519,habituation habitual I seen people with

0:55:31.299,0:55:35.650,Thoren trying to say no I think so yeah

0:55:33.519,0:55:38.109,through their technology yeah that's how

0:55:35.650,0:55:40.900,they became so great you know you know

0:55:38.109,0:55:42.910,get all these freshmen hooked on apples

0:55:40.900,0:55:45.039,when they're in college cuz they're in

0:55:42.910,0:55:46.960,the labs and then the next thing you

0:55:45.039,0:55:50.920,know you've got generations out there

0:55:46.960,0:55:53.890,right and so anyway I I'm a total Mac

0:55:50.920,0:55:58.150,person I love them I they seem really

0:55:53.890,0:56:01.779,intuitive to me to use them but and but

0:55:58.150,0:56:04.539,I've grown up with them great I mean so

0:56:01.779,0:56:06.160,and then I guess what about the software

0:56:04.539,0:56:08.109,that you used you started with the sort

0:56:06.160,0:56:11.220,of basic word processing then did you

0:56:08.109,0:56:14.829,move to an Apple word processing

0:56:11.220,0:56:17.920,software or was it like we're perfect or

0:56:14.829,0:56:21.999,do you remember I mean they I can't even

0:56:17.920,0:56:24.430,name oh gosh I'm not programmed names

0:56:21.999,0:56:26.619,but yeah and now are you using Microsoft

0:56:24.430,0:56:29.619,Word uh-huh okay but you're also using

0:56:26.619,0:56:31.660,pages yeah so so you're moving between

0:56:29.619,0:56:35.680,software there has that been a newer

0:56:31.660,0:56:38.349,thing since the iPad or yeah I may get a

0:56:35.680,0:56:40.529,new iPad pretty soon out and I don't I

0:56:38.349,0:56:43.779,don't know if I want to buy another

0:56:40.529,0:56:45.970,Microsoft Word you know yeah yeah pages

0:56:43.779,0:56:49.089,seems to and it's fine yeah it moves

0:56:45.970,0:56:57.130,into we're just fine right right

0:56:49.089,0:56:58.509,but I learned Photoshop okay when I was

0:56:57.130,0:57:02.249,magazine editor

0:56:58.509,0:57:03.999,I edited Willow Springs oh yeah for

0:57:02.249,0:57:07.900,about six years

0:57:03.999,0:57:09.339,and so I learned that was in 1990 mm-hmm

0:57:07.900,0:57:11.560,look over the editorship of that

0:57:09.339,0:57:15.970,magazine when I came out to Eastern

0:57:11.560,0:57:19.690,and they they were doing the magazine

0:57:15.970,0:57:23.050,with there was no computer technology

0:57:19.690,0:57:28.410,the woman who had done it before me was

0:57:23.050,0:57:31.330,like she was into the light board thing

0:57:28.410,0:57:33.810,yeah which I had learnt which I had

0:57:31.330,0:57:36.490,learned in college I in journalism class

0:57:33.810,0:57:39.880,you know with the sticky pili things

0:57:36.490,0:57:44.440,mm-hmm do you really saw this in high

0:57:39.880,0:57:46.600,school yeah and I could not believe that

0:57:44.440,0:57:50.590,they had no computer program or anything

0:57:46.600,0:57:54.130,so a guy in the journalism Department

0:57:50.590,0:57:56.290,gave me a copy page maker to put on the

0:57:54.130,0:58:00.930,computer and I instantly fell in love

0:57:56.290,0:58:03.850,with it yeah I just oh I love this I

0:58:00.930,0:58:05.560,love doing the art for the magazine I

0:58:03.850,0:58:07.570,did the covers you know I mean I found

0:58:05.560,0:58:09.610,the art and yeah and made the covers

0:58:07.570,0:58:13.930,myself because there was nobody else to

0:58:09.610,0:58:16.210,do it right and so I learned pagemaker

0:58:13.930,0:58:18.790,at the very beginning when it was just

0:58:16.210,0:58:23.130,out right and then and she probably know

0:58:18.790,0:58:25.000,that became Photoshop right so I just

0:58:23.130,0:58:28.270,kind of stayed with it

0:58:25.000,0:58:30.040,oh yeah all these years and so actually

0:58:28.270,0:58:37.380,you've been using Photoshop for 20 years

0:58:30.040,0:58:40.120,Wow and you know I buy every other

0:58:37.380,0:58:41.650,Photoshop that's that's been my mo I

0:58:40.120,0:58:44.830,don't try to keep up with every single

0:58:41.650,0:58:47.170,new one all right so I'm on five now but

0:58:44.830,0:58:48.520,I will probably get seven when it comes

0:58:47.170,0:58:49.960,out I'm a little worried that they're

0:58:48.520,0:58:51.910,not going to do that anymore they seem

0:58:49.960,0:58:55.540,to be moving to that like subscription

0:58:51.910,0:58:57.340,basis normally yeah how do you mean well

0:58:55.540,0:59:00.700,you know we buy it a lot for the digital

0:58:57.340,0:59:02.320,computers and I'm starting to hear that

0:59:00.700,0:59:03.700,they're you know they're offering it now

0:59:02.320,0:59:06.070,so you can you know basically pay a

0:59:03.700,0:59:09.100,monthly fee and get Photoshop or get

0:59:06.070,0:59:11.320,InDesign or get the design suite but so

0:59:09.100,0:59:13.270,I'm not sure how often if they're gonna

0:59:11.320,0:59:15.460,be selling those like student in teacher

0:59:13.270,0:59:17.380,kind of additions anymore or if they're

0:59:15.460,0:59:19.270,gonna be charging a subscription fee

0:59:17.380,0:59:20.680,which in my mind is gonna be way more

0:59:19.270,0:59:22.150,expensive especially because we have so

0:59:20.680,0:59:23.040,many copies it might be cheaper overall

0:59:22.150,0:59:26.400,for an individual

0:59:23.040,0:59:27.990,but interesting yeah so I'm not sure I'm

0:59:26.400,0:59:29.820,not actually positive about that but

0:59:27.990,0:59:36.000,it's how I sort of have heard on the

0:59:29.820,0:59:40.310,wind that might be coming around I don't

0:59:36.000,0:59:40.310,know I mean tax write-offs oh yeah yeah

0:59:40.430,0:59:45.720,so you so you were you were pretty

0:59:42.750,0:59:47.100,familiar with computers from from pretty

0:59:45.720,0:59:49.680,much here most of you the professional

0:59:47.100,0:59:51.870,career as they became more prevalent in

0:59:49.680,0:59:53.910,the society at large did that effect I

0:59:51.870,0:59:55.320,mean I guess it affected probably your

0:59:53.910,0:59:57.080,correspondence with your editors and

0:59:55.320,0:59:59.760,whatnot in example things like that

0:59:57.080,1:00:01.620,did that affect anything in the way that

0:59:59.760,1:00:06.540,you write to do start to feel different

1:00:01.620,1:00:13.980,and writing feel different um it felt

1:00:06.540,1:00:17.010,more constant I guess like my students

1:00:13.980,1:00:20.940,said Vermont College they want to send

1:00:17.010,1:00:24.720,me their work everything online now and

1:00:20.940,1:00:28.620,I feel like I cannot I cannot get away

1:00:24.720,1:00:33.750,from sitting here you know 10 hours 12

1:00:28.620,1:00:38.490,hours a day and that that part I I don't

1:00:33.750,1:00:41.130,like as much I I still I like reading

1:00:38.490,1:00:42.690,you know in in a comfy chair right and I

1:00:41.130,1:00:44.910,feel like we're moving away from that

1:00:42.690,1:00:47.100,now that that's becoming less and and

1:00:44.910,1:00:50.940,I'm you know I'm writing ebooks myself

1:00:47.100,1:00:53.480,now so yeah so I'm a culprit too great

1:00:50.940,1:01:01.830,but I can read my iPad in a comfy chair

1:00:53.480,1:01:04.200,yes I still like reading in bed but once

1:01:01.830,1:01:07.310,I discover that I can read my iPad in

1:01:04.200,1:01:07.310,bed I was happy

1:01:14.280,1:01:22.890,I am sort of interested to I guess in

1:01:18.630,1:01:24.090,sort of typographical or or graphical

1:01:22.890,1:01:25.980,things in the enemy knew you were

1:01:24.090,1:01:28.470,familiar with PageMaker did that did any

1:01:25.980,1:01:30.420,of that like ability of the computer to

1:01:28.470,1:01:32.430,adjust or I mean like I like I think in

1:01:30.420,1:01:34.710,quake with those breaks that were kind

1:01:32.430,1:01:36.090,of like a little like kind of jagged

1:01:34.710,1:01:39.510,lines I don't know where those came from

1:01:36.090,1:01:41.190,if that was a computer thing or you know

1:01:39.510,1:01:42.780,what I'm talking about cuz I got shit

1:01:41.190,1:01:43.950,breaks like the breaks within the

1:01:42.780,1:01:46.110,stories that would be like yeah like

1:01:43.950,1:01:49.230,section breaks that had like kind of I

1:01:46.110,1:01:52.140,think that might have been the design

1:01:49.230,1:01:54.060,book design oh that was okay

1:01:52.140,1:01:55.950,but did any of that influence your

1:01:54.060,1:01:58.170,writing I mean did you start to I mean

1:01:55.950,1:02:00.930,you obviously work with fonts and design

1:01:58.170,1:02:02.550,aspects and layout did that influence

1:02:00.930,1:02:04.230,anything with your poems I mean I know

1:02:02.550,1:02:06.060,they also you know a lot of them will

1:02:04.230,1:02:07.230,have at least the earlier ones some of

1:02:06.060,1:02:10.620,them wouldn't we've kind of tab by tab

1:02:07.230,1:02:12.210,and then I mean there's other different

1:02:10.620,1:02:14.700,sort of strategies and their later poems

1:02:12.210,1:02:17.670,too but then I don't know I mean I guess

1:02:14.700,1:02:24.050,I'm trying to think about what you're

1:02:17.670,1:02:24.050,asking me cuz I'm just not remembering I

1:02:24.170,1:02:29.400,guess if there's any particular way that

1:02:26.910,1:02:34.530,that changed in my writing itself yeah I

1:02:29.400,1:02:35.700,mean I don't think it was I guess when

1:02:34.530,1:02:36.630,you're writing in your note maybe this

1:02:35.700,1:02:39.120,way to get when you're writing in your

1:02:36.630,1:02:40.710,notebook are you writing with sort of

1:02:39.120,1:02:42.990,indentation and other things like that

1:02:40.710,1:02:47.940,or are you pretty much down the left

1:02:42.990,1:02:49.590,margin did those does that sort of

1:02:47.940,1:02:52.520,layout thing transfer into the computer

1:02:49.590,1:02:55.110,you write you know I what little

1:02:52.520,1:02:57.240,experimenting I've done along those

1:02:55.110,1:02:58.740,lines with poems I've done on the

1:02:57.240,1:03:03.480,computer screen okay

1:02:58.740,1:03:04.560,yeah okay I mean that's I think my I

1:03:03.480,1:03:07.740,know we're gonna talk about this later

1:03:04.560,1:03:10.530,what I'm doing now I'm doing these

1:03:07.740,1:03:11.730,altered book pages right no if I showed

1:03:10.530,1:03:16.590,you any of those because those are all

1:03:11.730,1:03:20.250,blocked files but I'm doing these

1:03:16.590,1:03:22.500,altered book pages and those are

1:03:20.250,1:03:25.410,that's where all of everything I know

1:03:22.500,1:03:29.130,about Photoshop and my poetry is like

1:03:25.410,1:03:33.180,finally coming together into yeah

1:03:29.130,1:03:36.319,something that feels more my own yeah

1:03:33.180,1:03:38.960,different so we can talk about that but

1:03:36.319,1:03:44.670,so is that different than the photons

1:03:38.960,1:03:50.790,yes okay yeah and it's what sort of

1:03:44.670,1:03:53.520,formal night oh yeah so I'm um I'd put

1:03:50.790,1:03:56.640,these online I've been this is mainly

1:03:53.520,1:04:00.240,what I've been publishing lately I found

1:03:56.640,1:04:06.060,this old encyclopedia up here from the

1:04:00.240,1:04:08.609
30s mmm and I've been scanning the pages

1:04:06.060,1:04:17.430,okay and especially pages that have a

1:04:08.609,1:04:26.060,lot of graphic material in them and so I

1:04:17.430,1:04:29.040,I put them on this website but in a Oh

1:04:26.060,1:04:32.339,in a locked gallery cuz this is how I

1:04:29.040,1:04:35.750,share them then with editors okay okay

1:04:32.339,1:04:42.000,so let's see I'll try to find that

1:04:35.750,1:04:43.890,encyclopedia once here so Zenfolio is

1:04:42.000,1:04:46.109,like it's like a web service kind of

1:04:43.890,1:04:49.829,yeah this isn't really for a

1:04:46.109,1:04:51.990,photographer's website but I just liked

1:04:49.829,1:04:55.020,it because it has a really clean look

1:04:51.990,1:04:57.359,yeah and their slideshow mode is really

1:04:55.020,1:05:00.589,nice yes so this this is the book I'm

1:04:57.359,1:05:04.550,doing with my husband right now and

1:05:00.589,1:05:15.180,these are his mmm these are his

1:05:04.550,1:05:18.780,illustrations so you can see so this is

1:05:15.180,1:05:21.119,my fiction project okay that I'm this is

1:05:18.780,1:05:23.250,the novella this is yeah I got this I

1:05:21.119,1:05:25.650,will only I haven't shared this actually

1:05:23.250,1:05:31.650,with any editors yet cuz I'm only just

1:05:25.650,1:05:34.020,putting this online that's a section the

1:05:31.650,1:05:38.440,writer page

1:05:34.020,1:05:41.470,this is called pull for stop ok so then

1:05:38.440,1:05:43.390,and then the story goes like this

1:05:41.470,1:05:45.820,so these are Rick's pieces and then I

1:05:43.390,1:05:49.270,have this little story that goes with

1:05:45.820,1:05:52.120,these characters mm-hmm in the book here

1:05:49.270,1:05:54.250,and each page I think of it as a little

1:05:52.120,1:05:56.710,like flash fiction yeah

1:05:54.250,1:05:59.500,yeah so I kind of think of them as

1:05:56.710,1:06:01.210,linked flash fictions and they're

1:05:59.500,1:06:08.500,relating in some way to the image oh

1:06:01.210,1:06:10.420,yeah so that's that book that book and I

1:06:08.500,1:06:17.230,was telling you about the encyclopedia

1:06:10.420,1:06:20.080,and that's book of no ledge okay and so

1:06:17.230,1:06:23.350,this is hi send them out now to editors

1:06:20.080,1:06:27.010,mm-hmm I'll I'll probably send like two

1:06:23.350,1:06:29.470,or three of these pieces in you know the

1:06:27.010,1:06:32.610,online submission or whatever and then I

1:06:29.470,1:06:35.500,send them a link to this to this gallery

1:06:32.610,1:06:37.450,and the password that they need to

1:06:35.500,1:06:41.470,access it because it'll lock to gallery

1:06:37.450,1:06:43.630,that way I can kind of track on you know

1:06:41.470,1:06:45.340,how many people are looking editors are

1:06:43.630,1:06:48.310,looking at my stuff at the same time

1:06:45.340,1:06:51.640,right and then when somebody takes a

1:06:48.310,1:06:54.400,piece I put these little asterisks yes

1:06:51.640,1:06:56.560,my screwed up thing no even so they kind

1:06:54.400,1:06:59.200,of can realize oh those are out of

1:06:56.560,1:07:05.670,commission then sure so that's what so

1:06:59.200,1:07:09.340,now I'm kind of actually putting a poem

1:07:05.670,1:07:12.250,and I hate all the sales stuff in here

1:07:09.340,1:07:14.800,but there's something I'm actually kind

1:07:12.250,1:07:19.090,of replacing the text that was here in

1:07:14.800,1:07:21.070,these cyclopædia with a poem and and so

1:07:19.090,1:07:23.080,you'll do that in photoshop like you'll

1:07:21.070,1:07:24.580,erase the text and then you'll are you

1:07:23.080,1:07:28.540,trying to match the font and some way it

1:07:24.580,1:07:30.130,looks like or at least kind of the and

1:07:28.540,1:07:33.040,then those are images from the text

1:07:30.130,1:07:35.500,originally yes actually they're from

1:07:33.040,1:07:39.700,like three different pages in the text

1:07:35.500,1:07:41.320,and then I've colorized them too that's

1:07:39.700,1:07:44.620,a really neat project it's really been

1:07:41.320,1:07:45.700,fun I like oh I like doing that you can

1:07:44.620,1:07:47.740,see I've kind of done

1:07:45.700,1:07:52.420,a little bit of a racer stuff yeah here

1:07:47.740,1:07:53.200,yeah and then this part is my poem over

1:07:52.420,1:07:55.840,here uh-huh

1:07:53.200,1:08:00.280,so I like ships with these and slide

1:07:55.840,1:08:08.470,shows there come out larger but I kind

1:08:00.280,1:08:12.760,of like having a mix of what was the

1:08:08.470,1:08:15.790,Encyclopedia language with Nantz talk

1:08:12.760,1:08:20.800,uh-huh kind of I like going back and

1:08:15.790,1:08:23.530,forth so that's this has been where I've

1:08:20.800,1:08:27.160,really started to use the technology

1:08:23.530,1:08:29.410,much more yeah then I was before so I

1:08:27.160,1:08:32.680,have all this people this is the

1:08:29.410,1:08:36.130,straight cyclopædia

1:08:32.680,1:08:39.540,Nantz stuff and I hope they kind of talk

1:08:36.130,1:08:45.040,back and forth to each other the

1:08:39.540,1:08:48.220,language and yeah no I see what you're

1:08:45.040,1:08:50.620,saying my language hear their language

1:08:48.220,1:08:52.120,and well and it's sort of it's sort of

1:08:50.620,1:08:54.940,like the contextualizes and sort of

1:08:52.120,1:08:56.380,decontextualize of this is yeah yeah

1:08:54.940,1:08:58.470,this is my little conversation with

1:08:56.380,1:09:02.590,Proust I've been reading Proust this

1:08:58.470,1:09:08.860,year.i me and Proust are on a timeout

1:09:02.590,1:09:10.810,right now anyway that's so that's what

1:09:08.860,1:09:12.880,they look like I like the Pete I like

1:09:10.810,1:09:15.130,the pages from the encyclopedia that

1:09:12.880,1:09:19.960,have all this graphic material you need

1:09:15.130,1:09:23.080,so I can um I kind of take what was you

1:09:19.960,1:09:26.860,know I put all these kind of romance

1:09:23.080,1:09:31.150,words around and this one Timberwolf

1:09:26.860,1:09:33.310,love nipped muskox for me I gave them

1:09:31.150,1:09:35.110,kind of anyway yeah different

1:09:33.310,1:09:37.210,yeah merciless but a person would have

1:09:35.110,1:09:39.130,to sort of go in there and look a little

1:09:37.210,1:09:41.440,bit right that's right it would just be

1:09:39.130,1:09:44.940,its yeah I mean it's yeah you need to if

1:09:41.440,1:09:48.130,it pays to pay attention right that's

1:09:44.940,1:09:51.400,that's where things have sort of evolved

1:09:48.130,1:09:53.950,computer wise for me and how does that I

1:09:51.400,1:09:55.540,mean what's the like does it feel

1:09:53.950,1:09:57.280,different is it just or does it seem

1:09:55.540,1:09:58.900,like the same creative process for you I

1:09:57.280,1:10:01.929,mean I mean it's visual

1:09:58.900,1:10:04.239,and textual so there's that but in terms

1:10:01.929,1:10:09.280,of using the computer to make is that a

1:10:04.239,1:10:12.070,change well so the way I've been I have

1:10:09.280,1:10:13.840,some really interesting different ways

1:10:12.070,1:10:17.349,that I've been doing these that has

1:10:13.840,1:10:20.080,never been even remotely like working on

1:10:17.349,1:10:24.909,the poems are the stories so I'll print

1:10:20.080,1:10:27.280,out first the original scans in black

1:10:24.909,1:10:28.659,and white right that's what I carry

1:10:27.280,1:10:30.909,around in my little notebook

1:10:28.659,1:10:32.889,yeah I'm still fixated to the notebook

1:10:30.909,1:10:34.750,there right so I'm carrying those around

1:10:32.889,1:10:37.290,in the notebook and then I just actually

1:10:34.750,1:10:42.730,just start scribbling on the pages

1:10:37.290,1:10:44.469,scribbling stuff out I'm one of the

1:10:42.730,1:10:47.460,things that I'm kind of doing with this

1:10:44.469,1:10:51.670,book project with the encyclopedia is

1:10:47.460,1:10:54.909,this is my version of a Collected Poems

1:10:51.670,1:11:00.219,of Nance Van Winkle so I'm kind of

1:10:54.909,1:11:02.650,mining oh my early poems cuz I that's

1:11:00.219,1:11:03.969,the idea of doing a collected or

1:11:02.650,1:11:07.179,selected or something just kind of

1:11:03.969,1:11:10.330,boring to me actually okay but this made

1:11:07.179,1:11:12.310,it more interesting to do yeah because

1:11:10.330,1:11:15.520,I'll just pull out oh I always like this

1:11:12.310,1:11:18.489,dance I'm just yeah yeah this dance and

1:11:15.520,1:11:22.119,then I forget the rest of that foam

1:11:18.489,1:11:24.849,right but these five lines I like so

1:11:22.119,1:11:27.610,I'll sprinkle them in there and it's

1:11:24.849,1:11:31.150,been fun to kind of find the visual

1:11:27.610,1:11:33.940,material that I think they fit well yeah

1:11:31.150,1:11:37.330,so anyway and with the you know wealth

1:11:33.940,1:11:38.830,of human knowledge from 1913 exactly

1:11:37.330,1:11:40.869,exactly yeah

1:11:38.830,1:11:44.800,and you know I feel like I'm kind of

1:11:40.869,1:11:46.540,talking I have I said one of the things

1:11:44.800,1:11:52.330,that's going on in this project is I'm

1:11:46.540,1:11:57.989,talking back to history in a way that's

1:11:52.330,1:12:00.580,not right and I like that I like that

1:11:57.989,1:12:05.020,emesis and I guess in some ways the

1:12:00.580,1:12:07.270,software allows you more purchase on

1:12:05.020,1:12:09.400,making those deletions and adjustments

1:12:07.270,1:12:13.290,exactly then it would have been just

1:12:09.400,1:12:13.290,like crossing out or a light board

1:12:13.320,1:12:18.459,yeah and the erase your thing you know

1:12:16.059,1:12:20.289,that a lot of people are doing yeah that

1:12:18.459,1:12:23.139,seems like you know I'm good friends

1:12:20.289,1:12:25.179,with Mary roof holes doing that raising

1:12:23.139,1:12:28.059,race your stuff right yeah I feel like

1:12:25.179,1:12:31.179,unless I could one-up Mary rueful I'm

1:12:28.059,1:12:32.530,not doing that I'm not going there there

1:12:31.179,1:12:38.320,are people who are doing that so much

1:12:32.530,1:12:44.589,better yeah that radios the Paradise

1:12:38.320,1:12:48.280,Lost Alicia who did one like Jonathan

1:12:44.589,1:12:51.339,Safran Foer he did it he did some

1:12:48.280,1:12:53.469,terrible really yeah he bugs me anyway

1:12:51.339,1:12:54.609,yeah a lot I think maybe too many people

1:12:53.469,1:12:56.589,jumped on the eraser

1:12:54.609,1:12:58.389,it's font-family right I mean it's it's

1:12:56.589,1:13:00.879,but it's hard I mean it's really I mean

1:12:58.389,1:13:03.219,to do it in the way that is really

1:13:00.879,1:13:06.820,really hard I mean like yeah here's what

1:13:03.219,1:13:09.760,Mary rueful says the way I do it is I

1:13:06.820,1:13:12.129,look at the page and then pretty soon if

1:13:09.760,1:13:26.349,I just stare at it for a while a few

1:13:12.129,1:13:29.829,words flowed off what Billie would know

1:13:26.349,1:13:33.729,it's flowed up let me thank you

1:13:29.829,1:13:37.530,I feel like you've seen a lot of these

1:13:33.729,1:13:37.530,questions in the course of it

1:13:48.320,1:13:52.659,Oh can you find your files like if

1:13:51.079,1:13:56.989,you're looking for like a certain poem

1:13:52.659,1:13:58.789,on your computer would you do you have

1:13:56.989,1:14:00.469,difficulty locating them or are you is

1:13:58.789,1:14:07.309,your organization such that you pretty

1:14:00.469,1:14:10.489,much know where things are I have lost I

1:14:07.309,1:14:14.090,have lost things and yeah almost every

1:14:10.489,1:14:16.630,week I have a little battle because I

1:14:14.090,1:14:20.960,can't remember what I called something

1:14:16.630,1:14:22.610,yeah yeah do you worry at all about the

1:14:20.960,1:14:28.130,security or sort of fixity of these

1:14:22.610,1:14:30.110,digital files no no you mean somebody

1:14:28.130,1:14:32.679,else accessing them or some well that

1:14:30.110,1:14:35.570,and then I mean or the the kind of

1:14:32.679,1:14:37.610,fidelity of them I guess I mean I mean

1:14:35.570,1:14:39.349,you do say that you have floppy disks

1:14:37.610,1:14:40.699,and old Word Perfect documents or

1:14:39.349,1:14:42.650,something that you can't access that is

1:14:40.699,1:14:45.880,that a concern to you or you just think

1:14:42.650,1:14:45.880,that will kind of take care of itself

1:14:46.210,1:14:51.050,it's not concerned to me you know it

1:14:48.829,1:14:53.869,should be no I I don't I actually don't

1:14:51.050,1:14:56.989,think it should be but um and I'm you

1:14:53.869,1:14:58.369,know that so it's okay but I mean yeah

1:14:56.989,1:14:59.869,there's definitely things you can do but

1:14:58.369,1:15:01.849,I mean it's one of those things that I

1:14:59.869,1:15:04.250,think well I guess the other question is

1:15:01.849,1:15:07.369,have the changes in computers I mean

1:15:04.250,1:15:10.760,like you know probably in the 90s early

1:15:07.369,1:15:12.889
90s computers crashed much more often

1:15:10.760,1:15:14.510,you were more likely to lose work did

1:15:12.889,1:15:18.739,that ever influence the ways that you've

1:15:14.510,1:15:21.519,worked on computers or was that are you

1:15:18.739,1:15:23.989,pretty much kept the same strategies I

1:15:21.519,1:15:26.119,have pretty much kept the same

1:15:23.989,1:15:29.869,strategies you know I've never had a

1:15:26.119,1:15:32.420,really bad thing happen where I lost a

1:15:29.869,1:15:40.909,hard drive or anything like that

1:15:32.420,1:15:44.480,I know I know and you know they gotta

1:15:40.909,1:15:49.519,they usually do I mean I just I love all

1:15:44.480,1:15:50.960,their products I do so a few questions

1:15:49.519,1:15:52.340,but of course bonnets and teaching

1:15:50.960,1:15:53.929,although I think recovers from that and

1:15:52.340,1:15:58.159,we'll talk about the photons and then

1:15:53.929,1:16:00.099,that would be it so you did have you

1:15:58.159,1:16:01.629,ever correspondent very much in like

1:16:00.099,1:16:03.729,physical letters has that ever been a

1:16:01.629,1:16:05.019,portion or were they I mean related to

1:16:03.729,1:16:07.030,your writing I don't need to know you

1:16:05.019,1:16:09.129,know the personal correspondence not so

1:16:07.030,1:16:14.099,much but I mean like writing wise career

1:16:09.129,1:16:16.539,wise was that ever no physical letters I

1:16:14.099,1:16:18.550,well like I was telling you with that

1:16:16.539,1:16:21.359,first book of poems I've kept all the

1:16:18.550,1:16:25.649,letters that he wrote to me about

1:16:21.359,1:16:28.809,revision yeah I don't know they just

1:16:25.649,1:16:30.669,they're very dear write me great that

1:16:28.809,1:16:34.989,somebody took that kind of time with me

1:16:30.669,1:16:36.939,and and then I have a good friend who's

1:16:34.989,1:16:40.449,a poet I think I mentioned her teeth

1:16:36.939,1:16:42.489,Jennifer Boyd knew and she really loves

1:16:40.449,1:16:44.289,the physical letter and I've kept all

1:16:42.489,1:16:45.789,her letters that she's written me over

1:16:44.289,1:16:48.820,the years right there because they're

1:16:45.789,1:16:55.510,just beautiful and and it just always

1:16:48.820,1:16:58.359,seems like just the the idea that

1:16:55.510,1:17:00.689,somebody is writing this just to me you

1:16:58.359,1:17:03.669,know this three page letter with her

1:17:00.689,1:17:05.550,thoughts and ruminations about things

1:17:03.669,1:17:08.829,and they're just so beautifully written

1:17:05.550,1:17:11.699,that she would take the time to do that

1:17:08.829,1:17:12.909,you know it's yeah it seems like a a

1:17:11.699,1:17:16.090,treasure

1:17:12.909,1:17:18.449,thing because it's passing but do I do

1:17:16.090,1:17:18.449,it

1:17:19.659,1:17:26.739,do you have any similar feelings for

1:17:22.709,1:17:33.309,emails emails that you feel dear about

1:17:26.739,1:17:36.760,uh I I do keep some emails I have you

1:17:33.309,1:17:40.419,know files with emails that I keep from

1:17:36.760,1:17:43.629,certain people and then and it sort of

1:17:40.419,1:17:44.979,corollary to that do you feel like and

1:17:43.629,1:17:46.659,this is an odd question but do you have

1:17:44.979,1:17:50.379,any sort of feelings towards your

1:17:46.659,1:17:52.149,digital files about yet your poems do

1:17:50.379,1:17:53.409,you feel like are they dear to you and

1:17:52.149,1:17:57.729,the same way maybe a notebook would be

1:17:53.409,1:18:00.129,near to you or no no the notebook is

1:17:57.729,1:18:03.809,dearer okay yeah I don't know I don't

1:18:00.129,1:18:06.510,know what that's weird you touch it a

1:18:03.809,1:18:08.679,big part of it I think

1:18:06.510,1:18:10.659,yeah there's me I don't know yeah it's

1:18:08.679,1:18:12.420,one of those one of those things I don't

1:18:10.659,1:18:14.160,know if that will change like

1:18:12.420,1:18:16.770,one never had like the physical in the

1:18:14.160,1:18:18.360,future if they like have the special

1:18:16.770,1:18:21.710,folder on their desktop that just seems

1:18:18.360,1:18:27.260,odd to me but you know I try to be

1:18:21.710,1:18:30.719,careful that I've always got a hard copy

1:18:27.260,1:18:32.699,somewhere of the material I'm working I

1:18:30.719,1:18:35.480,like this book that I'm doing with my

1:18:32.699,1:18:41.010,husband okay

1:18:35.480,1:18:46.199,they all are because and well the way

1:18:41.010,1:18:50.370,that well to finish that that fought

1:18:46.199,1:18:54.030,about just being careful because if this

1:18:50.370,1:18:57.179,if things go awry here I really I don't

1:18:54.030,1:19:00.210,want to lose the work completely right

1:18:57.179,1:19:01.710,so I I try to make sure that I have a

1:19:00.210,1:19:04.440,hard copy it's not always the most

1:19:01.710,1:19:10.620,recent copy yeah but there's there's a

1:19:04.440,1:19:14.310,copy right so and with this book I did

1:19:10.620,1:19:17.160,all of the arranging of it I stuck them

1:19:14.310,1:19:20.370,on that wall in the hallway okay and all

1:19:17.160,1:19:22.230,the pages were on that wall and I was

1:19:20.370,1:19:25.500,moving I had little sticky things on the

1:19:22.230,1:19:28.620,back and I was moving them around to

1:19:25.500,1:19:29.969,make the sections of the book for it was

1:19:28.620,1:19:33.750,up there for like three months

1:19:29.969,1:19:35.190,yeah huh three three months huh so you

1:19:33.750,1:19:37.350,would just would you come home and see

1:19:35.190,1:19:38.940,them and make a few changes or was it

1:19:37.350,1:19:43.350,like it would it be a dedicated time

1:19:38.940,1:19:45.239,that you'd go to it or um well it was I

1:19:43.350,1:19:47.969,was at that stage with the book where I

1:19:45.239,1:19:50.640,had all these pages but I wasn't exactly

1:19:47.969,1:19:54.090,sure know how I was gonna arrange the

1:19:50.640,1:19:56.790,the chronology again on this story yeah

1:19:54.090,1:20:01.140,so I started experimenting with

1:19:56.790,1:20:04.110,different orders of things by putting

1:20:01.140,1:20:06.960,this trying the sections on the on the

1:20:04.110,1:20:09.900,board on the wall that way yeah moving

1:20:06.960,1:20:13.050,them around so that's so before I had

1:20:09.900,1:20:16.860,each page as its own file you in there

1:20:13.050,1:20:18.870,you know now and now they have sections

1:20:16.860,1:20:20.869,too so section I think they're five

1:20:18.870,1:20:23.750,sections in the book

1:20:20.869,1:20:26.540,and those came from the wall yes okay so

1:20:23.750,1:20:29.630,but I had to I could not figure out a

1:20:26.540,1:20:31.639,way to look at that many pages on the

1:20:29.630,1:20:35.119,screen at one time and yeah I mean

1:20:31.639,1:20:39.290,actually see the print okay and so that

1:20:35.119,1:20:41.719,was yeah I felt like I technology wasn't

1:20:39.290,1:20:44.889,allowing me to see the big picture the

1:20:41.719,1:20:51.040,way I mean it to the big screen

1:20:44.889,1:20:51.040,yes and I'm sure they're coming

1:20:52.090,1:21:00.889,exactly yeah you need a big wall that's

1:20:55.159,1:21:10.010,a computer and if Mac makes it I'm

1:21:00.889,1:21:11.810,buying it I guess we did talk a little

1:21:10.010,1:21:13.790,bit about your teaching and that you you

1:21:11.810,1:21:17.540,you do correspond by email with your

1:21:13.790,1:21:22.000,students mostly is that now if they

1:21:17.540,1:21:24.830,insist on okay on sending me their work

1:21:22.000,1:21:26.989,as attachments and everything I'll read

1:21:24.830,1:21:28.610,it that way I don't mind doing it with

1:21:26.989,1:21:30.800,the poet's with the fiction people I

1:21:28.610,1:21:32.869,would much much rather they send me

1:21:30.800,1:21:35.480,their work in the mail okay

1:21:32.869,1:21:36.980,and usually they're okay listen you can

1:21:35.480,1:21:38.929,kind of take it and not have to be

1:21:36.980,1:21:42.469,connected and not have to and then yeah

1:21:38.929,1:21:45.469,yeah and I just I do not like writing my

1:21:42.469,1:21:49.849,comments on church in with the

1:21:45.469,1:21:52.580,blackboard program or any of those the

1:21:49.849,1:21:55.040,college has that available to us and I

1:21:52.580,1:21:57.830,have done track changes in Word I know

1:21:55.040,1:21:59.719,how to use that okay look I just I just

1:21:57.830,1:22:02.510,like to scribble in the largest right

1:21:59.719,1:22:04.429,right so in that in that aspect of your

1:22:02.510,1:22:07.719,work and your life like you just would

1:22:04.429,1:22:10.639,ultimately prefer physical

1:22:07.719,1:22:15.650,correspondence yeah totally yeah okay

1:22:10.639,1:22:18.500,yeah and then I guess the other thing

1:22:15.650,1:22:20.030,with with like writing and distraction I

1:22:18.500,1:22:21.440,guess is it's like when are you

1:22:20.030,1:22:22.849,connected to the Internet when you're

1:22:21.440,1:22:25.219,writing do you ever have to like do you

1:22:22.849,1:22:28.110,ever like disconnect turn off your Wi-Fi

1:22:25.219,1:22:30.690,or something is that a problem or

1:22:28.110,1:22:32.159,our concern for you or do you use it are

1:22:30.690,1:22:34.920,you like if you look very looking things

1:22:32.159,1:22:35.880,up while you're writing at all or that's

1:22:34.920,1:22:39.630,a good question

1:22:35.880,1:22:40.800,um I don't like to be disconnected from

1:22:39.630,1:22:44.130,the net anymore

1:22:40.800,1:22:45.840,yeah it's terrible yeah I I like to

1:22:44.130,1:22:51.540,check in with my peeps all the time now

1:22:45.840,1:22:55.199,right okay and yeah I I mean I use the

1:22:51.540,1:23:01.080,dictionary on here all the time because

1:22:55.199,1:23:02.880,it's just so much faster yeah so it is

1:23:01.080,1:23:05.610,so it's a tool weather and then whatever

1:23:02.880,1:23:07.380,writing space you're in a notebook or

1:23:05.610,1:23:08.400,not you're still using computer as a

1:23:07.380,1:23:11.790,tool to assist you

1:23:08.400,1:23:14.310,yeah and I mean I'm always I've always

1:23:11.790,1:23:16.980,got something going on that's like like

1:23:14.310,1:23:22.199,you know like right now I'm talking to

1:23:16.980,1:23:23.699,agents and if they email me if I see an

1:23:22.199,1:23:26.719,email come in while I'm actually working

1:23:23.699,1:23:31.619,on something I gotta go see what that is

1:23:26.719,1:23:34.290,right great um assault so it hasn't and

1:23:31.619,1:23:36.360,that distraction point of it's not a

1:23:34.290,1:23:40.080,real concern for you I mean you see you

1:23:36.360,1:23:42.389,are producing quite a bit so it was more

1:23:40.080,1:23:47.239,when I was younger but I guess maybe I'm

1:23:42.389,1:23:49.530,learning how to how to go back how to

1:23:47.239,1:23:51.380,disconnect from it and go back to my

1:23:49.530,1:23:54.420,work pretty fast then huh

1:23:51.380,1:23:56.580,has there been something you found to

1:23:54.420,1:23:57.690,help do that I mean like what media if

1:23:56.580,1:24:00.840,you're distinguishing between your

1:23:57.690,1:24:03.389,younger working and now I guess maybe

1:24:00.840,1:24:06.929,just like a lot of younger people I'm

1:24:03.389,1:24:09.810,just more used to being attached to it

1:24:06.929,1:24:13.440,you know I I'll have my I'll be doing

1:24:09.810,1:24:16.679,something on my iPad communicating with

1:24:13.440,1:24:19.260,somebody or talking on Facebook or

1:24:16.679,1:24:22.159,whatever yeah well Rick and I are

1:24:19.260,1:24:25.409,watching a movie at night mm-hmm

1:24:22.159,1:24:26.489,so I'm there's much more multitask

1:24:25.409,1:24:28.139,learning a sort of way of

1:24:26.489,1:24:35.010,compartmentalizing yeah seems pretty

1:24:28.139,1:24:37.320,seamless yeah when is the last question

1:24:35.010,1:24:38.849,about teaching like when you when you've

1:24:37.320,1:24:41.219,had now you're probably getting students

1:24:38.849,1:24:43.170,who've grown up only with the compute

1:24:41.219,1:24:44.730,right and that changed your relationship

1:24:43.170,1:24:47.520,to the weight I mean has that sort of

1:24:44.730,1:24:51.210,changed your idea about what it does its

1:24:47.520,1:24:54.120,effects anything like that well it's

1:24:51.210,1:24:58.250,changed to the sense that um mm-hm

1:24:54.120,1:25:00.719,when students talk to me about their own

1:24:58.250,1:25:02.910,composing process and of course they

1:25:00.719,1:25:05.910,they do everything on the computer they

1:25:02.910,1:25:09.180,don't they not ever a lot of them write

1:25:05.910,1:25:14.790,anything at all in longhand yeah I don't

1:25:09.180,1:25:17.630,even know if they can and and so I'm I'm

1:25:14.790,1:25:21.989,okay with that I feel like I've sort of

1:25:17.630,1:25:26.210,made my piece that they it's people are

1:25:21.989,1:25:28.680,perfectly able to write to find a good

1:25:26.210,1:25:31.530,composition process that works for them

1:25:28.680,1:25:35.489,that doesn't have to do with paper and

1:25:31.530,1:25:38.390,pens at all and so I'm accepting of that

1:25:35.489,1:25:42.630,I you know I don't try to like shove my

1:25:38.390,1:25:44.750,process off or say look you might like

1:25:42.630,1:25:48.900,to write it on a piece of paper first

1:25:44.750,1:25:51.960,you know why that's I know I know that

1:25:48.900,1:25:56.270,I'm I'm hanging onto something that's if

1:25:51.960,1:25:59.219,you want a pen to pen on the paper to me

1:25:56.270,1:26:01.140,they have some there's something else

1:25:59.219,1:26:04.320,going on between the eye and the hand

1:26:01.140,1:26:06.300,and the page okay you know yeah yeah I

1:26:04.320,1:26:07.860,still feel that when I'm working

1:26:06.300,1:26:09.270,especially on poems that there's

1:26:07.860,1:26:11.610,something happening between the eye and

1:26:09.270,1:26:14.250,the fingers in the in the page that's

1:26:11.610,1:26:16.949,very tactile that I I'm hanging on to

1:26:14.250,1:26:18.630,that I like so you so you would say I

1:26:16.949,1:26:20.460,mean for those that are only composing

1:26:18.630,1:26:22.199,on a computer and not never going to

1:26:20.460,1:26:23.880,handwriting or never using entering at

1:26:22.199,1:26:26.580,all that's what they're missing that

1:26:23.880,1:26:28.469,sort of hand I don't know I don't think

1:26:26.580,1:26:31.290,they necessarily are missing it

1:26:28.469,1:26:33.210,I think they've they've probably learn

1:26:31.290,1:26:35.760,or are learning to do a step in the

1:26:33.210,1:26:37.469,composing process you know that maybe

1:26:35.760,1:26:39.750,that thing where you're writing with

1:26:37.469,1:26:42.270,your eyes closed yep I mean the thing

1:26:39.750,1:26:45.260,but that they grow up with that and so

1:26:42.270,1:26:49.320,they get the same whatever imaginative

1:26:45.260,1:26:52.460,connection mm-hmm with the keyboard do

1:26:49.320,1:26:54.269,you find that they're as open to

1:26:52.460,1:27:02.349,revision

1:26:54.269,1:27:11.530,maybe an older student well they can be

1:27:02.349,1:27:13.389,made they can they some think that's

1:27:11.530,1:27:14.920,just part of the learning process right

1:27:13.389,1:27:17.110,so you don't think it's anything

1:27:14.920,1:27:20.679,distinct to this generation no okay

1:27:17.110,1:27:24.749,I think they just have too many of them

1:27:20.679,1:27:27.579,I some of them get it right away that

1:27:24.749,1:27:29.619,that revising can actually make a work

1:27:27.579,1:27:30.729,better yeah you know I've been working

1:27:29.619,1:27:33.159,with this woman

1:27:30.729,1:27:35.650,right now who came in saying that she

1:27:33.159,1:27:36.820,doesn't like to revise because she likes

1:27:35.650,1:27:39.579,to just sit down and write everything

1:27:36.820,1:27:44.050,out really fast and one big draft and

1:27:39.579,1:27:47.530,her stuff is a mess and so it's my

1:27:44.050,1:27:53.320,personal mission with her to help her to

1:27:47.530,1:27:56.079,come to believe that actually revising

1:27:53.320,1:27:58.749,or working in some other manner you know

1:27:56.079,1:28:02.650,like maybe having writing a scene at a

1:27:58.749,1:28:06.059,time right what will benefit the work

1:28:02.650,1:28:08.079,but she's very young and this her first

1:28:06.059,1:28:10.719,she never she didn't even have an

1:28:08.079,1:28:11.530,undergraduate degree oh wow in the

1:28:10.719,1:28:16.229,writing salt

1:28:11.530,1:28:16.229,she's starting it yeah we're one yeah

1:28:19.019,1:28:23.829,okay well the last kind of group of

1:28:22.150,1:28:26.559,questions I have are about the photons

1:28:23.829,1:28:28.300,and but I guess you have you have a

1:28:26.559,1:28:30.780,number of different I was thinking of

1:28:28.300,1:28:32.550,these being your sort of primary

1:28:30.780,1:28:35.619,computer-assisted

1:28:32.550,1:28:38.349,project but you have several going at

1:28:35.619,1:28:41.579,the same time it seems including the

1:28:38.349,1:28:45.749,collected your novella are there other

1:28:41.579,1:28:49.389,projects as well okay and are they are

1:28:45.749,1:28:51.639,they supplanting your fiction and poetry

1:28:49.389,1:28:55.239,writing or are they sort of just in

1:28:51.639,1:28:58.420,addition to I am wrestling with this

1:28:55.239,1:29:02.110,question myself okay I think poetry

1:28:58.420,1:29:06.880,right now the new poetry is kind of

1:29:02.110,1:29:07.800,going into the these altered book pages

1:29:06.880,1:29:12.070,there

1:29:07.800,1:29:16.870,for four of those projects going on okay

1:29:12.070,1:29:19.450,right now okay and I am working on a

1:29:16.870,1:29:22.020,book of regular poems those prose poems

1:29:19.450,1:29:22.020,mm-hmm

1:29:22.740,1:29:30.360,but the all the fiction I'm working are

1:29:26.410,1:29:33.580,all ebooks now I've just completed

1:29:30.360,1:29:36.970,novella not this one but a different one

1:29:33.580,1:29:41.620,that's an e-book that's um in the form

1:29:36.970,1:29:44.350,of a scrapbook photograph album No so

1:29:41.620,1:29:48.010,and that's that's the one I'm trying to

1:29:44.350,1:29:51.190,talk to agents about okay and they're

1:29:48.010,1:29:52.570,gonna and and you you you have only you

1:29:51.190,1:29:56.020,don't expect to see it in physical form

1:29:52.570,1:29:59.380,at all you just this this is the the

1:29:56.020,1:30:02.200,question that we are trying to work

1:29:59.380,1:30:07.650,through I mean I don't care about seeing

1:30:02.200,1:30:10.060,it as a print book but apparently

1:30:07.650,1:30:13.030,publishers don't want to take a book

1:30:10.060,1:30:14.320,unless they can also have it as a print

1:30:13.030,1:30:21.430,book because they don't make any money

1:30:14.320,1:30:24.040,on the ebooks yes so yeah so an agent

1:30:21.430,1:30:30.340,doesn't want to take me on as the client

1:30:24.040,1:30:35.400,unless I am doing the print book and the

1:30:30.340,1:30:37.360,e-book is this sort of bonus okay so

1:30:35.400,1:30:38.860,that's what we're kind of going around

1:30:37.360,1:30:40.930,and around the bout and then I think

1:30:38.860,1:30:42.460,well maybe I'll just go out there and do

1:30:40.930,1:30:44.860,it on my own

1:30:42.460,1:30:46.990,try to do it with an e-book publisher

1:30:44.860,1:30:51.880,who is just doing that so I'm just

1:30:46.990,1:30:53.950,trying I just I am just this is all new

1:30:51.880,1:30:56.320,to me and I new territory and I'm just

1:30:53.950,1:30:57.820,trying to navigate at myself right you

1:30:56.320,1:31:00.940,know I don't know what I'm doing yeah

1:30:57.820,1:31:02.770,but it's in in terms of like the process

1:31:00.940,1:31:06.340,and the composition everything it still

1:31:02.770,1:31:07.480,seems pretty much you know computer and

1:31:06.340,1:31:09.070,on computer like it's still like that

1:31:07.480,1:31:11.500,kind of well I mean the computer is a

1:31:09.070,1:31:13.450,big part of it but you're still writing

1:31:11.500,1:31:15.460,the notebook and pushing it in or is it

1:31:13.450,1:31:16.950,a lot of that still happening on is that

1:31:15.460,1:31:19.720,are the ebooks happening on the computer

1:31:16.950,1:31:22.140,no I'm sorry in the text part in

1:31:19.720,1:31:22.140,notebook

1:31:23.099,1:31:28.359,how does the sort of visual aspect

1:31:25.629,1:31:32.829,relate back to your writing especially

1:31:28.359,1:31:34.359,you sort of maybe I mean you use a lot

1:31:32.829,1:31:37.389,of imagery in your poems in in your

1:31:34.359,1:31:40.389,fiction but now you are actually using

1:31:37.389,1:31:42.459,images so what's what's that what's that

1:31:40.389,1:31:44.859,feel like I mean are you using them in

1:31:42.459,1:31:48.309,the same ways you use imagery or is it a

1:31:44.859,1:31:50.649,totally different well I mean you hit it

1:31:48.309,1:31:53.709,right on the head that's it exactly I

1:31:50.649,1:31:56.530,mean everything I loved about poetry the

1:31:53.709,1:32:01.959,you know the image thing yeah now I'm

1:31:56.530,1:32:04.119,making actual images and you know I'm

1:32:01.959,1:32:08.889,putting a little bit of text in there

1:32:04.119,1:32:11.499,and you know now I'm starting your

1:32:08.889,1:32:15.579,wrestle with well that's too much text

1:32:11.499,1:32:19.569,you know it's everything that's

1:32:15.579,1:32:22.959,happening now has gotten to be less less

1:32:19.569,1:32:24.760,and less text yeah trying I'm trying to

1:32:22.959,1:32:29.669,find the right balance between the

1:32:24.760,1:32:32.829,visual component on the piece and

1:32:29.669,1:32:34.959,certain that sort of means minimal text

1:32:32.829,1:32:37.419,I think yeah so that they don't fight

1:32:34.959,1:32:40.329,each other I mean so what is I mean what

1:32:37.419,1:32:41.679,is like how do you find the right

1:32:40.329,1:32:43.329,language for that

1:32:41.679,1:32:45.639,I mean like what sort is that I mean

1:32:43.329,1:32:47.139,that seems like a different a different

1:32:45.639,1:32:49.569,a different almost a different thing

1:32:47.139,1:32:53.079,than writing poetry yeah okay yeah and

1:32:49.569,1:32:57.339,that I mean it's like placing see this

1:32:53.079,1:33:00.879,this is what for me when I turned 60 and

1:32:57.339,1:33:03.729,I I I'm doing this work it's made it

1:33:00.879,1:33:05.319,exciting again like when I was 20 yeah

1:33:03.729,1:33:08.639,because I am

1:33:05.319,1:33:12.189,language has gotten has been refreshed

1:33:08.639,1:33:15.339,by this new sort of interjection of the

1:33:12.189,1:33:18.249,actual visual material in the same

1:33:15.339,1:33:19.869,location with the text right and it's

1:33:18.249,1:33:21.879,made it like a brand new thing for me

1:33:19.869,1:33:25.569,and it just I don't know I feel like oh

1:33:21.879,1:33:30.249,good now I can get through to my 80s

1:33:25.569,1:33:31.599,okay and I'm bored if you didn't okay so

1:33:30.249,1:33:32.640,so kind of two-part question if you

1:33:31.599,1:33:34.170,didn't have that to still

1:33:32.640,1:33:36.060,the computer that you have and that you

1:33:34.170,1:33:39.420,develop from working with PageMaker

1:33:36.060,1:33:40.860,and or if you just have not worked with

1:33:39.420,1:33:43.170,into computer do you think you would

1:33:40.860,1:33:45.930,have turned to visual art in a physical

1:33:43.170,1:33:47.880,format but it's okay no it would have

1:33:45.930,1:33:50.700,been too much to learn I think okay I

1:33:47.880,1:33:53.610,mean it still feels like a lot to learn

1:33:50.700,1:33:57.720,I mean I take classes every week I'm

1:33:53.610,1:34:00.060,taking online classes I mean I I still

1:33:57.720,1:34:05.660,can't get how to do text on a path

1:34:00.060,1:34:05.660,what's wrong I can't make my path good

1:34:07.910,1:34:14.340,but anyway so I take these little online

1:34:10.820,1:34:16.320,classes through Photoshop do you take

1:34:16.320,1:34:20.970,artist do you have any sort of art

1:34:17.820,1:34:23.310,instruction as well yes oh yes okay yeah

1:34:20.970,1:34:26.250,from him from him yeah and I've been

1:34:23.310,1:34:30.360,taking like regular college classes too

1:34:32.490,1:34:36.630,out there I said well yes I'll come but

1:34:35.430,1:34:38.520,do you think it would be alright if I

1:34:45.780,1:34:50.730,editing class and stuff but anyway I

1:34:47.610,1:34:52.980,just I felt like I just needed to be in

1:34:50.730,1:34:54.090,that environment with visual artists

1:34:52.980,1:34:56.700,where they're talking about composition

1:34:54.090,1:34:59.790,yeah cuz that's what I was starting at

1:34:56.700,1:35:02.730,the at that beginning place yeah just

1:34:59.790,1:35:05.130,composition and design great great no I

1:35:02.730,1:35:09.030,think there's my husband comes in I

1:35:38.160,1:35:41.550,composition and design okay and that's

1:35:40.200,1:35:42.150,what I mean I said that is a big part of
