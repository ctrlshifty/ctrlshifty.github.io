0:02:39.329,0:02:49.14,messy yeah um I write a lot when I'm
0:02:44.220,0:02:54.51,walking ok so I think long walls and in
0:02:49.140,0:03:04.86,a scribble enough book like this just
0:02:54.510,0:03:06.73,usually individual lines and and then
0:03:04.860,0:03:11.40,often L will alone
0:03:06.739,0:03:13.70,transcribe Monda note cards okay just
0:03:11.400,0:03:15.56,you know this says you're a missive
0:03:13.709,0:03:19.47,offspring that holds what you've got in
0:03:15.569,0:03:22.50,there um which is uh lines that I was
0:03:19.470,0:03:25.73,working toward up Ponemah come offspring
0:03:22.500,0:03:27.56,in sperm which is a response to a
0:03:25.739,0:03:30.48,sculptor named Bruce peas when he has
0:03:27.569,0:03:32.31,determinism ohoo uh we've been doing
0:03:30.480,0:03:34.62,this kind of collaboration Oh neat and
0:03:32.310,0:03:38.84,I've been writing my self-portrait
0:03:34.620,0:03:41.48,through the lens of his sculptures so he
0:03:38.849,0:03:43.26,sent me a sculpture called offspring
0:03:41.489,0:03:46.07,which is in a house if you want to see
0:03:43.260,0:03:48.56,it one of his sculptures yeah I wrote a
0:03:46.079,0:03:51.85,poem called offspring in sprung
0:03:48.560,0:03:54.45,responding to his sculpture yeah and um
0:03:51.859,0:03:57.66,so when I was writing that I was taking
0:03:54.450,0:04:00.56,long walks and just scribbling down
0:03:57.660,0:04:03.51,random lines yeah I can write individual
0:04:00.569,0:04:05.60,lines by hand when it comes to a whole
0:04:03.510,0:04:09.27,poem I do it
0:04:05.600,0:04:11.73,okay so this one says even the evenings
0:04:09.270,0:04:14.66,are odd even odds are even
0:04:11.730,0:04:16.86,offspring terminal equinox off-kilter
0:04:14.660,0:04:20.82,what you're not lines I ended up using
0:04:16.860,0:04:23.16,but so often when I'm doing this kind of
0:04:20.820,0:04:25.26,walking I'll end up with a stack let's
0:04:23.160,0:04:26.94,take another card yeah and then when I'm
0:04:25.260,0:04:29.85,at the computer I'll ship them around
0:04:26.940,0:04:31.77,and take a mop it and rearrange them and
0:04:29.850,0:04:33.75,shuffle them and move them into
0:04:31.770,0:04:35.37,different places closely so you'll have
0:04:33.750,0:04:37.44,them like kind of spread out in a grid
0:04:35.370,0:04:40.34,on your debt yeah essentially and then
0:04:37.440,0:04:43.20,move them around how does that help you
0:04:40.340,0:04:44.97,does that help you are you putting I
0:04:43.200,0:04:47.37,guess are you picturing them on a page
0:04:44.970,0:04:49.50,then is that you start or are you still
0:04:47.370,0:04:51.48,kind of picturing them in the air or
0:04:49.500,0:04:53.34,something like that very much in the air
0:04:51.480,0:04:55.98,and I'll do a thing where I'll start
0:04:53.340,0:04:57.98,writing by peeling out a car okay so
0:04:55.980,0:05:02.64,like I'll just randomly heal a card
0:04:57.980,0:05:04.23,coverts of the cube and start writing
0:05:02.640,0:05:09.57,from that on the computer okay
0:05:04.230,0:05:14.16,um I'm a big fan of crabs and gambler
0:05:09.570,0:05:16.26,and um and uh and I like to think of
0:05:14.160,0:05:19.29,words as if my rolls of the dice anyway
0:05:16.260,0:05:20.94,yeah so often when I'm beginning a poem
0:05:19.290,0:05:25.83,I'll start with just straight lines and
0:05:20.940,0:05:27.84,images or phrases quotations like this
0:05:25.830,0:05:30.00,and then when I'm at down sit down with
0:05:27.840,0:05:34.50,the computer I'll feel them out with
0:05:30.000,0:05:37.47,something like you're in geometry okay
0:05:34.500,0:05:39.60,um my son was teenage son was in
0:05:37.470,0:05:40.98,geometry taken off the tree but I was
0:05:39.600,0:05:43.50,thinking about Bruce before the
0:05:40.980,0:05:45.90,sculpture now geometrical is abstract
0:05:43.500,0:05:47.64,sculptures or okay so right like you're
0:05:45.900,0:05:49.14,in geometry which is also not something
0:05:47.640,0:05:55.55,I ended up using now I kind of like it
0:05:49.140,0:05:55.55,now it is good to be periodically fixing
0:05:55.669,0:06:01.41,so yeah I do it what a handwriting work
0:05:59.640,0:06:04.98,like that especially when I'm walking
0:06:01.410,0:06:07.41,okay and where you walk ah there is a
0:06:04.980,0:06:12.12,debate is about half a mile from here
0:06:07.410,0:06:13.92,for MA and the beach is about one mile
0:06:12.129,0:06:15.55,exactly so there's a beach called little
0:06:13.929,0:06:17.49,to welcome Beach uh-huh
0:06:15.550,0:06:20.22,I usually walk from here down to there
0:06:17.499,0:06:22.80,okay and sit on the rocks covered by the
0:06:20.229,0:06:25.53,water by the beach and will you write
0:06:22.809,0:06:27.58,while you're walking again okay yeah I
0:06:25.539,0:06:28.05,carry either note cards or notebook with
0:06:27.580,0:06:29.97,me
0:06:28.059,0:06:32.11,scribble things down as I'm walking and
0:06:29.979,0:06:35.00,do you have specific notebooks that you
0:06:32.110,0:06:39.90,use I mean that seems like a very unique
0:06:35.009,0:06:41.31,notebooks Byzantine cross yeah is that I
0:06:39.909,0:06:43.59,mean you kind of appropriate for a mouth

0:06:49.089,0:06:53.49,just write titles often I start with
0:06:50.919,0:06:54.66,just titles okay so just yesterday I
0:06:53.499,0:06:57.15,wrote false-negatives

0:07:04.240,0:07:09.24,start with a title like that and start
0:07:05.769,0:07:11.40,in the Lebanon in um scribbling down
0:07:09.249,0:07:13.97,lines for it in a journal like this one
0:07:11.409,0:07:16.59,New England when I get enough lines
0:07:13.979,0:07:17.94,either putting my note cards or just sit
0:07:16.599,0:07:20.81,down with the computer in the notebook
0:07:17.949,0:07:22.83,and start transcribing and moving around
0:07:20.819,0:07:30.66,things that I've written in the notebook
0:07:22.839,0:07:32.11,I can't remember the last time and I may
0:07:30.669,0:07:33.72,never have done it written an entire
0:07:32.110,0:07:35.91,poem by hand
0:07:33.729,0:07:38.05,okay without a typewriter or a computer
0:07:35.919,0:07:40.99,I know I just don't work that way yeah
0:07:38.050,0:07:43.08,but you do right by being a lot of the
0:07:40.990,0:07:45.09,pieces of the song I generate yeah
0:07:43.089,0:07:47.86,fragments are on the edge of
0:07:45.099,0:07:50.52,consolidating and moving inland making a
0:07:47.860,0:07:54.06,poem at home for me has always been done
0:07:50.529,0:07:58.36,on a computer or typewriter before you
0:07:54.069,0:08:00.00,yeah so what do you do to kind of say
0:07:58.360,0:08:01.50,like when you're finished with the

0:11:07.630,0:11:14.29,okay I am when I'm in the summer or on
0:11:11.620,0:11:16.15,sabbatical is on sabbatical most of year
0:11:14.290,0:11:19.57,report last uh-huh
0:11:16.150,0:11:20.44,then I write every day yeah all day as

0:11:20.440,0:11:29.47,um and I mean they're here at my desk
0:11:25.329,0:11:31.18,right there or right here or walking and
0:11:29.470,0:11:33.57,often I'll walk for two hours and come
0:11:31.180,0:11:35.94,back and write
0:11:33.570,0:11:37.95,so look what it's very good
0:11:35.940,0:11:41.01,I'm a really obsessive writer so when
0:11:37.950,0:11:43.20,I'm writing I do it kind of non-stop
0:11:41.010,0:11:45.66,okay but I've long periods where I don't
0:11:43.200,0:11:47.57,write and usually there any kind of
0:11:45.660,0:11:50.61,schedule and usually those correspond to
0:11:47.579,0:11:53.51,your teaching yeah okay and you teach is
0:11:50.610,0:11:55.98,Western on a quarter system okay see
0:11:53.519,0:12:02.37,teach from September to module agree

0:12:02.370,0:12:07.11,right so let me kind of back up for a
0:12:05.880,0:12:08.69,second
0:12:07.110,0:12:14.37,we've talked some about your practices
0:12:08.699,0:12:16.32,now the I'd like to kind of like think
0:12:14.370,0:12:18.54,about kind of different eras in your own
0:12:16.320,0:12:20.67,career and your writing practices then
0:12:18.540,0:12:23.13,too and we can kind of relate them a
0:12:20.670,0:12:24.87,little bit hopefully but before we got
0:12:23.130,0:12:27.95,could you could you say how long you've
0:12:24.870,0:12:33.24,been writing I have Mike this is an air
0:12:27.959,0:12:36.51,quotes look professionally um a lot of
0:12:33.240,0:12:42.54,memory my first book was published 198,0:12:36.510,0:12:44.57,so 98 2008 2025 can I take you and could
0:12:42.540,0:12:46.82,you give kind of a describe back in to
0:12:44.579,0:12:50.10,give a broad art of your career just to
0:12:46.829,0:12:51.77,kind of brown the interview and in terms
0:12:50.100,0:12:53.94,of what I've written is those yeah where
0:12:51.779,0:12:56.39,you been what what you know what's what
0:12:53.940,0:12:57.42,the progress has been etc okay so I grew
0:12:56.399,0:12:59.79,up in Macon Georgia
0:12:57.420,0:13:03.77,I started writing poems owners about 1,0:12:59.790,0:13:08.67,okay and really awful awful poems
0:13:03.779,0:13:10.58,finished well but I I kept writing all
0:13:08.670,0:13:13.44,through high school and went over in
0:13:10.589,0:13:16.64,college did a lot of creative writing
0:13:13.440,0:13:18.20,classes majored in English and then I
0:13:16.649,0:13:21.52,went to Columbia University MSA program
0:13:18.209,0:13:27.14,hmm after that immediately after that
0:13:21.529,0:13:30.08,graduate from there in 82 and did a
0:13:27.149,0:13:31.36,series of editorial jobs during the
0:13:30.089,0:13:33.83,first half
0:13:31.360,0:13:37.46,writing for alumni magazines and things
0:13:33.830,0:13:38.84,like that and other other magazines or
0:13:37.460,0:13:41.77,what for a magazine called good life
0:13:38.840,0:13:43.31,which was a magazine of design to be
0:13:41.779,0:13:43.73,marketed to the richest people in the
0:13:43.310,0:13:46.85,country
0:13:43.730,0:13:50.20,ah since I got 1% top 1% man
0:13:46.850,0:13:53.14,and ironically went bankrupt sure
0:13:50.200,0:13:59.77,kidding
0:13:53.140,0:14:01.63,and then in 86 Wesleyan University Press
0:13:59.779,0:14:06.80,accepted my first book who could
0:14:01.630,0:14:09.89,spirituals and and that gave me that
0:14:06.800,0:14:12.02,kind of jolt I needed to think because I
0:14:09.890,0:14:14.69,just felt this increasingly grotesque
0:14:12.020,0:14:17.42,disjunction between what I was doing for
0:14:14.690,0:14:20.33,a living what I cared about yeah
0:14:17.420,0:14:23.21,so I went back and got a PhD and at the
0:14:20.330,0:14:26.80,immersive virtual in American literature
0:14:23.210,0:14:31.91,your dissertation Emily Dickinson and
0:14:26.800,0:14:33.32,and in while I was in a ph.d program I
0:14:31.910,0:14:36.98,wrote most of my second book the
0:14:33.320,0:14:40.78,creation the 2005 State University Prize
0:14:36.980,0:14:43.91,and was published in 94 blue children
0:14:40.780,0:14:45.35,was that a troublemaker knows that the
0:14:43.910,0:14:48.23,next one was Charles right now that was
0:14:45.350,0:14:49.94,the I think David Cetina was current
0:14:48.230,0:14:53.48,judge of that
0:14:49.940,0:14:57.71,I came here to Western in 92 we've got
0:14:53.480,0:15:01.19,to Bellingham in 92 for 92 and in 9,0:14:57.710,0:15:07.21,Charles Wright picked the my third book
0:15:01.190,0:15:07.21,someone mr. go-to for the cover-up and
0:15:07.900,0:15:17.78,and in Leslie published signs and
0:15:10.339,0:15:20.54,abominations in 2005 years later
0:15:17.780,0:15:21.30,Lord bringing a book about cosmology in
0:15:20.540,0:15:25.26,the mind
0:15:21.300,0:15:26.94,bringing in yeah look at metaphysics
0:15:25.260,0:15:33.26,through the physicality of the brain and
0:15:26.940,0:15:36.64,and the structures of the cosmos one did
0:15:33.269,0:15:40.98,University of Georgia press competition
0:15:36.649,0:15:42.99,was published funny and then the corpse
0:15:40.980,0:15:44.45,flower my new intellectual poems was
0:15:42.990,0:15:49.37,published by the University of
0:15:44.459,0:15:52.20,Washington press Nina 2007 decades and
0:15:49.370,0:15:57.99,most recent was the Olivia which all
0:15:52.200,0:16:00.24,published in 2004 enduring and from 199,0:15:57.990,0:16:03.06,to now you've been professor at Western
0:16:00.240,0:16:07.26,watching game teaching
0:16:03.060,0:16:10.35,oh well it soap so I have the this kind
0:16:07.260,0:16:12.64,of broken apart into like composition
0:16:10.350,0:16:14.89,writing prewriting generative structure
0:16:12.649,0:16:16.70,revising revision and then
0:16:14.899,0:16:19.92,organizational archival which is more
0:16:16.709,0:16:20.88,like putting books together etc and I'd
0:16:19.920,0:16:23.39,like to talk about it in different
0:16:20.880,0:16:25.01,stages and events and so like if those
0:16:23.399,0:16:26.04,don't work for your writing profit let
0:16:25.019,0:16:28.07,me know that kind of talk about
0:16:26.040,0:16:31.58,differently but we'll put the probably
0:16:28.079,0:16:33.51,won't even probably saw but so what was
0:16:31.589,0:16:36.27,your so when you first like let's say
0:16:33.510,0:16:37.62,for you know right out of college at the
0:16:36.270,0:16:39.32,tuna first flip what was your writing
0:16:37.620,0:16:44.45,process like then I mean what were you
0:16:39.329,0:16:48.32,probably writing then I was a working as
0:16:44.459,0:16:51.06,I said a series of editorial jobs and
0:16:48.329,0:16:56.88,did a lot of writing at work which was
0:16:51.060,0:16:58.29,nice because I had jobs working for PR
0:16:56.880,0:17:03.45,offices at colleges and universities
0:16:58.290,0:17:05.25,yeah but they were jobs where there was
0:17:03.450,0:17:06.28,a huge amount of spare time where there
0:17:05.250,0:17:08.65,was really good
0:17:06.280,0:17:11.43,do ya I wasn't expected to and you're
0:17:08.650,0:17:15.13,something to be done you know that old
0:17:11.439,0:17:17.47,ads a maytag repair and there was an old
0:17:15.130,0:17:20.38,famous ad campaigning fair Maytag
0:17:17.470,0:17:21.73,washing machines and the joke of it was
0:17:20.380,0:17:24.03,that the washing machine neighbor
0:17:21.730,0:17:26.43,program so they had Maytag repairs and
0:17:24.030,0:17:28.87,the maytag repair people just really
0:17:26.439,0:17:31.12,bored and i didn't did so i had a sign
0:17:28.870,0:17:35.41,of my dog so my guess is hit my checker
0:17:31.120,0:17:41.08,bigger and up but i lost air time so
0:17:35.410,0:17:43.57,right a lot at work on my typewriter for
0:17:41.080,0:17:46.84,computers so it was a lot of my first
0:17:43.570,0:17:48.43,look in those jobs and so when you see
0:17:46.840,0:17:50.29,so when you talk about like the kind of
0:17:48.430,0:17:52.36,hurt like prewriting generated so are
0:17:50.290,0:17:54.94,you Rio is your that were you taking
0:17:52.360,0:17:56.62,notes like you do now I mean how how did
0:17:54.940,0:17:59.41,you get to the poems I guess to that
0:17:56.620,0:18:01.63,week I'll just typing you just type it
0:17:59.410,0:18:04.90,type it on them probably had one of
0:18:01.630,0:18:05.14,those notebooks here yeah yeah here's
0:18:04.900,0:18:09.04,one
0:18:05.140,0:18:10.81,and I was printing out looks a little
0:18:09.040,0:18:13.45,bit later this is 92 but it was printed
0:18:10.810,0:18:15.25,out on these long rolls of them printer
0:18:13.450,0:18:18.79,paper on the gold
0:18:15.250,0:18:23.56,don't style printer rolls that with the
0:18:18.790,0:18:25.78,like Syrian edges here yeah so yeah so
0:18:23.560,0:18:28.78,just try doing essentially what I do now
0:18:25.780,0:18:31.65,large chunks of prose that would lead to
0:18:28.780,0:18:35.83,ideas and sort of multiple ideas yeah
0:18:31.650,0:18:37.78,little segment on typewriter okay and
0:18:35.830,0:18:39.34,then printing it out that way so you
0:18:37.780,0:18:44.74,started when you were starting you were
0:18:39.340,0:18:46.96,writing on typewriter and and I had a
0:18:44.740,0:18:48.94,similar mode as kind of generative did
0:18:46.960,0:18:50.95,you do walks or anything like that and
0:18:48.940,0:18:54.25,the early no it had to be my dad so I
0:18:50.950,0:18:56.23,could be if you guys do you're in would
0:18:54.250,0:18:57.70,you would you write lines and then
0:18:56.230,0:19:00.46,rearrange them at that point or were you
0:18:57.700,0:19:04.15,kind of composing more closely full
0:19:00.460,0:19:07.94,homes exactly the same way I do it now
0:19:04.150,0:19:10.67,okay to change I need to tell them that
0:19:07.940,0:19:12.65,right straight lines and then start
0:19:10.670,0:19:16.07,pulling them together and rearranging
0:19:12.650,0:19:18.44,and you know different so it's much more
0:19:16.070,0:19:19.04,cumbersome to to retype it all than it
0:19:18.440,0:19:23.21,is now
0:19:19.040,0:19:27.65,yeah but essentially the same process
0:19:23.210,0:19:29.81,okay and then as you progress in your
0:19:27.650,0:19:37.21,career I mean when did you move to a
0:19:29.810,0:19:37.21,computer my first computer was probably
0:19:38.530,0:19:43.07,computer in graduate school I think
0:19:41.000,0:19:45.80,probably at the end of now because I
0:19:43.070,0:19:47.51,wrote my dissertation on the time now it
0:19:45.800,0:19:51.89,had a computer when I was writing my
0:19:47.510,0:19:54.77,dissertation in Virginia in the early
0:19:51.890,0:19:57.35,90s early 1990-91 and so when you were
0:19:54.770,0:19:59.54,when you were getting your PhD how what
0:19:57.350,0:20:03.44,was your writing style like I mean were
0:19:59.540,0:20:05.89,you writing a home mostly yeah and I was
0:20:03.440,0:20:09.71,writing I was doing one waltz it - okay
0:20:05.890,0:20:10.97,through Charlotte so something and it
0:20:09.710,0:20:13.58,was that when you started writing down
0:20:10.970,0:20:15.23,on the note cards now that's a pretty
0:20:13.580,0:20:20.00,recent thing that's a more recent video
0:20:15.230,0:20:21.35,okay so so you you've kind of so that's
0:20:20.000,0:20:24.55,sort of early that sort of note-taking
0:20:21.350,0:20:27.47,walking establish free early
0:20:24.550,0:20:29.69,what did anything change like as you
0:20:27.470,0:20:32.44,move to Bellingham or was the process
0:20:29.690,0:20:34.76,fairly similar for prewriting etcetera
0:20:32.440,0:20:37.73,it's been pretty constant yeah pretty
0:20:34.760,0:20:40.31,pretty Hamilton has it changed by
0:20:37.730,0:20:42.56,location at all I mean I guess one big
0:20:40.310,0:20:46.31,event property in your writing life is
0:20:42.560,0:20:47.84,is this thing what was it like I mean
0:20:46.310,0:20:49.52,was there a change when this came in
0:20:47.840,0:20:52.33,here I wouldn't was distilled this
0:20:49.520,0:20:55.43,cottage thinking about seven years ago
0:20:52.330,0:20:58.19,did-did-did your writing practice change
0:20:55.430,0:21:02.09,very much for it or was it just made
0:20:58.190,0:21:04.73,much more useful hey this is my flipper
0:21:02.090,0:21:07.25,this thing is crucial to my writing okay
0:21:04.730,0:21:10.13,this is the window check crank for a
0:21:07.250,0:21:12.83,hold fashioned window yeah and growing
0:21:10.130,0:21:16.04,up in Macon Georgia uh-huh and as a
0:21:12.830,0:21:19.57,child that started a process of flipping
0:21:16.040,0:21:19.57,this one or do
0:21:19.630,0:21:25.09,and I thought my flipper it's crucial to
0:21:22.720,0:21:27.04,my writing and I've had it ever since I
0:21:25.090,0:21:29.73,was a little kid okay but as a kid I
0:21:27.040,0:21:33.58,would throw it when I was thinking and
0:21:29.730,0:21:38.83,even as a teenager I would write mostly
0:21:33.580,0:21:40.39,by flipping this thing and um and but
0:21:38.830,0:21:41.89,it's something about the action or
0:21:40.390,0:21:43.71,repetitive action of throwing and
0:21:41.890,0:21:46.99,catching that's always been really
0:21:43.710,0:21:48.34,important to generating ideas yeah it's
0:21:46.990,0:21:51.43,similar to the kind of rhythm I have
0:21:48.340,0:21:55.26,when I'm walking at things uh-huh that
0:21:51.430,0:21:58.21,kind of rhythmic catch and release
0:21:55.260,0:22:00.07,so often when I'm writing all through my
0:21:58.210,0:22:02.26,life up get this thing that's been
0:22:00.070,0:22:04.51,afflicted while I'm thinking yeah and
0:22:02.260,0:22:07.87,it's often I can't think unless I'm
0:22:04.510,0:22:10.54,doing that the kinetic thing I think
0:22:07.870,0:22:13.80,yeah and when I'm walking off and I have
0:22:10.540,0:22:16.18,a stick or you know stick to them
0:22:13.800,0:22:19.54,something that in with the hands almost
0:22:16.180,0:22:20.95,always to it you know so I lost this
0:22:19.540,0:22:23.41,thing for a couple of years somehow I
0:22:20.950,0:22:27.93,got lost tonight it probably crazy
0:22:23.410,0:22:33.43,I found it I was like my flipper is back
0:22:27.930,0:22:34.87,that's really what what like like it
0:22:33.430,0:22:37.54,within the writing process do you have
0:22:34.870,0:22:39.85,certain times when you pick it up I mean
0:22:37.540,0:22:41.14,are you more likely to use it when
0:22:39.850,0:22:42.73,you're generating work or when you're
0:22:41.140,0:22:46.66,revising where is it
0:22:42.730,0:22:49.18,every up all times hold on especially
0:22:46.660,0:22:51.91,when I'm revising and when number of
0:22:49.180,0:22:53.04,eyes and I say the poems aloud over and
0:22:51.910,0:22:56.65,over okay
0:22:53.040,0:22:58.15,always and often when I'm walking I can
0:22:56.650,0:23:00.10,always tell a poem is almost finished
0:22:58.150,0:23:02.02,but because I've come to the point where
0:23:00.100,0:23:05.44,of memorized it without trying to yeah
0:23:02.020,0:23:08.80,just from saying it aloud some a times
0:23:05.440,0:23:10.90,mm-hmm and often good I'm walking I get
0:23:08.800,0:23:12.88,to a point where I've got a draft in my
0:23:10.900,0:23:15.97,mind and a mumbling to myself aloud
0:23:12.880,0:23:16.92,while I'm walking yeah to hear the
0:23:15.970,0:23:24.63,rhythm of it
0:23:16.920,0:23:26.31,sounded you know the words of it but
0:23:24.630,0:23:28.56,whenever advised in or when I was
0:23:26.310,0:23:31.74,generating new ideas alphys uselessly
0:23:28.560,0:23:34.68,yes and though my roommate in college
0:23:31.740,0:23:37.95,told me went to then there were first
0:23:34.680,0:23:42.81,day I was done I would leave her house
0:23:37.950,0:23:44.64,and come back to my my own room in in a
0:23:42.810,0:23:46.68,house where I was renting a room and I
0:23:44.640,0:23:48.42,would lie to bed and flip this thing he
0:23:46.680,0:23:49.83,came in and said you know you tell
0:23:48.420,0:23:52.77,Suzanne you're writing but really you're
0:23:49.830,0:23:54.44,just flipping you're flipping but
0:23:52.770,0:23:58.50,flipping my flippers are all right
0:23:54.440,0:24:02.28,that's what I'm building right just move
0:23:58.500,0:24:05.13,um I guess I guess I'm sort of trying to
0:24:02.280,0:24:07.71,get it I mean like so to be you'll be
0:24:05.130,0:24:08.88,you'll use your flipper in somewhat
0:24:07.710,0:24:10.47,pensive moments when you're kind of
0:24:08.880,0:24:12.63,considering what you've written or what
0:24:10.470,0:24:14.55,you're about to write but also maybe I
0:24:12.630,0:24:17.52,mean do you like when you're at your do
0:24:14.550,0:24:19.32,you do it at your desk ever uh
0:24:17.520,0:24:22.23,it's kind of hard to do this just get
0:24:19.320,0:24:24.66,yeah but I'm sitting or lying in advance
0:24:22.230,0:24:26.82,sort of okay so in here I'll hold us
0:24:24.660,0:24:30.75,mark your dad down sometimes in one look
0:24:26.820,0:24:35.61,at the sky lion you know do this and
0:24:30.750,0:24:37.89,thinking jump yeah um so so you're
0:24:35.610,0:24:39.63,saying you know earlier like what's once
0:24:37.890,0:24:41.61,you have these lines jotted down you
0:24:39.630,0:24:43.86,have the notes looks kind of composed
0:24:41.610,0:24:45.96,and you have ela also have big chunks of
0:24:43.860,0:24:48.72,prose in the computer that you've
0:24:45.960,0:24:51.86,written to I mean so how how does how
0:24:48.720,0:24:54.03,does this this jumbles become a poem
0:24:51.860,0:24:55.50,exactly I mean like what's what's this
0:24:54.030,0:24:57.33,where do you get to the point where you
0:24:55.500,0:25:00.03,start to rehearse it in your head and to
0:24:57.330,0:25:05.06,start it and revise it I don't think so
0:25:00.030,0:25:05.06,the pros that are right is
0:25:08.650,0:25:14.39,it's designed to get me it's just sort
0:25:11.990,0:25:16.30,of about thinking aloud mm-hmm and I
0:25:14.390,0:25:29.00,encourage my C's to try this too it
0:25:16.309,0:25:30.91,works really well for me anyway so start
0:25:29.000,0:25:32.29,with just a kind of diary not only a
0:25:30.919,0:25:36.41,diary but just sort of this is what's
0:25:32.299,0:25:41.27,happening yeah and then go from that to
0:25:36.410,0:25:43.01,general ideas and images fragments
0:25:41.270,0:25:45.77,sometimes I'll make lists of words that
0:25:43.010,0:25:48.65,take up spaces okay
0:25:45.770,0:25:50.87,sometimes though discipline unabridged
0:25:48.650,0:25:57.67,dictionary that I use to roll the dice
0:25:50.870,0:25:59.78,collectively yeah yeah and and sometimes
0:25:57.679,0:26:02.96,I will roll dice to pick a page in the
0:25:59.780,0:26:05.41,dictionary flip into that page and just
0:26:02.960,0:26:07.22,read that page until something in the
0:26:05.419,0:26:09.08,words or the etymologies or the
0:26:07.220,0:26:11.09,definitions triggers something and what
0:26:09.080,0:26:23.38,what would be dish what's with what
0:26:11.090,0:26:28.58,dictionary is that this is a Webster's
0:26:23.380,0:26:30.59,on a great jr. maybe Universal yeah so
0:26:28.580,0:26:34.37,I'll turn to a particular page cleanly
0:26:30.590,0:26:37.42,clean sweet clean shave and cleanser
0:26:34.370,0:26:40.21,clean routine cleaning woman clean
0:26:37.429,0:26:42.32,energy clean cut clean bill of health
0:26:40.210,0:26:44.53,waiting around it and if something
0:26:42.320,0:26:46.76,starts triggering something that's going
0:26:44.539,0:26:48.89,on uh-huh emotionally or intellectually
0:26:46.760,0:26:50.65,right yeah that moment in my life yeah
0:26:48.890,0:26:52.69,but thinking about cleaning this and I
0:26:50.659,0:26:55.37,might start typing and thinking about
0:26:52.690,0:26:58.37,associating with cleanness and dirt and
0:26:55.370,0:27:02.92,pollution and what it means for
0:26:58.370,0:27:04.90,something to be clean-cut and and so I
0:27:02.929,0:27:07.64,start writing with some lines you know
0:27:04.909,0:27:09.67,and then often what I'll do is once I've
0:27:07.640,0:27:10.02,got some lines or some ideas going I'll
0:27:09.679,0:27:15.18,go for
0:27:10.020,0:27:16.80,long and um oh just still whole page
0:27:15.180,0:27:19.95,with words it sounded with the word
0:27:16.800,0:27:22.05,clean okay how do you determine what
0:27:19.950,0:27:24.06,sounds good with the word please just
0:27:22.050,0:27:27.30,associatively clean machine for example
0:27:24.060,0:27:28.89,there comes good to me yeah um then I
0:27:27.300,0:27:31.59,would write maybe I'm a note card or
0:27:28.890,0:27:33.27,some notebooks in machine even those bit
0:27:31.590,0:27:35.64,doesn't mean anything to me even with a
0:27:33.270,0:27:38.49,clean machine and and walking out start
0:27:35.640,0:27:41.06,thinking about a clean machine you know
0:27:38.490,0:27:46.79,there just doesn't example yeah
0:27:41.060,0:27:46.79,so yes how do you get from fat pros to
0:27:47.390,0:27:54.54,the to two lines so just rejoin example
0:27:51.210,0:27:57.18,reading salon it is time it where time
0:27:54.540,0:27:58.26,is over Lana for my favorite learns in
0:27:57.180,0:28:03.24,salon
0:27:58.260,0:28:04.98,mmm-hmm amen to that I want to write a
0:28:03.240,0:28:06.75,damage self-portrait that's a poem that
0:28:04.980,0:28:09.30,ended up being a nun signs an
0:28:06.750,0:28:10.86,abomination you the principal being to
0:28:09.300,0:28:12.39,write about myself as I am now through
0:28:10.860,0:28:14.61,suggestive images rather than through
0:28:12.390,0:28:15.54,narrative or logical progression so up
0:28:14.610,0:28:17.55,times I'll start with that kind of
0:28:15.540,0:28:19.76,abstract this is what I want to do you
0:28:17.550,0:28:22.41,how to do it
0:28:19.760,0:28:26.07,series of images for myself for self it
0:28:22.410,0:28:28.37,in general disconnected images and then
0:28:26.070,0:28:31.56,I'll start writing lines wrenched win
0:28:28.370,0:28:33.03,and there it's just that the rent and
0:28:31.560,0:28:36.66,twins sound good together
0:28:33.030,0:28:39.78,rent twin gash in the oak trunk let's
0:28:36.660,0:28:42.09,suck on boots what comes back comes have
0:28:39.780,0:28:45.69,crucifix the awkward joining together of
0:28:42.090,0:28:47.85,two broken sticks um just sort of pre
0:28:45.690,0:28:51.44,associating images the ions and ideas
0:28:47.850,0:28:55.08,and words that sort of draw each other
0:28:51.440,0:28:57.06,reaffirming and after a while I'll take
0:28:55.080,0:29:00.18,some of his lens and start walking and
0:28:57.060,0:29:01.68,thinking about it what's in life suck on
0:29:00.180,0:29:04.11,boots what am I talking about
0:29:01.680,0:29:05.94,yeah so building on that how do you
0:29:04.110,0:29:07.68,determine like what comes first what
0:29:05.940,0:29:09.99,comes later what I mean how do you how
0:29:07.680,0:29:13.05,do you I guess still depression of the
0:29:09.990,0:29:14.82,poem uh at first I don't worry about
0:29:13.050,0:29:16.62,that at all because we just let lines
0:29:14.820,0:29:18.21,accumulate yeah
0:29:16.620,0:29:22.35,images accumulate
0:29:18.210,0:29:25.50,phrases until I have a whole series of
0:29:22.350,0:29:27.42,pages of grass yeah and then I'll start
0:29:25.500,0:29:28.20,worrying about try not to make this I
0:29:27.420,0:29:30.15,know I know
0:29:28.200,0:29:32.13,poets suit right from the first line on
0:29:30.150,0:29:33.51,yeah who begin with the first line and
0:29:32.130,0:29:36.09,then right beside mine
0:29:33.510,0:29:37.59,Linda Peters wants to let you access to
0:29:36.090,0:29:40.67,astonish me because it's so utterly
0:29:37.590,0:29:43.17,romantic anything I did yeah
0:29:40.670,0:29:44.79,but I really try especially when I'm
0:29:43.170,0:29:48.14,writing long poems which a lot of my
0:29:44.790,0:29:51.30,poems are not to impose any order on it
0:29:48.140,0:29:54.30,yeah until I've got pages and pages of
0:29:51.300,0:29:57.95,lines and then I'll print them out in
0:29:54.300,0:30:01.77,plan example okay so here I'll have like
0:29:57.950,0:30:04.95,pages of lines I'm on separated by this
0:30:01.770,0:30:06.93,asterisk or marks like with no attempted
0:30:04.950,0:30:08.25,coherence yeah and at that point I'll
0:30:06.930,0:30:10.50,start moving them around like what if I
0:30:08.250,0:30:12.81,start here and if I put this here
0:30:10.500,0:30:14.40,yeah and sometimes I'll have them all
0:30:12.810,0:30:16.56,written out of note cards and rearrange
0:30:14.400,0:30:17.73,the note cards because I'll have one
0:30:16.560,0:30:19.50,section and I'll go through that of
0:30:17.730,0:30:22.05,course and say what what would be
0:30:19.500,0:30:24.45,interesting after this and I'll move
0:30:22.050,0:30:27.27,that card to the second position and
0:30:24.450,0:30:29.49,then type it all up together looking in
0:30:27.270,0:30:31.08,that order you know it read it aloud
0:30:29.490,0:30:33.15,until it starts to sound right
0:30:31.080,0:30:36.12,and when you when you type it up on the
0:30:33.150,0:30:38.55,computer like that what do you I guess
0:30:36.120,0:30:40.26,I'm wondering where this all resides on
0:30:38.550,0:30:42.63,your computer like where if you have
0:30:40.260,0:30:44.22,like a folder for notes and minds and
0:30:42.630,0:30:45.66,then a folder for like poems that are
0:30:44.220,0:30:49.46,starting to come to fruition
0:30:45.660,0:30:49.46,would you let just say an exam sure
0:30:51.660,0:30:54.73,[Music]
0:30:58.280,0:31:05.97,what I do typically is within that file
0:31:02.010,0:31:08.76,where I have all the ruminations and
0:31:05.970,0:31:11.03,free associations and that concept yeah
0:31:08.760,0:31:14.10,what do you call that file I usually
0:31:11.039,0:31:15.99,when I'll show you okay so those are
0:31:14.100,0:31:18.87,just called by the name of the month to
0:31:15.990,0:31:21.21,make it eat the kidney in 201,0:31:18.870,0:31:29.42,yeah but often I'll give it a title it's
0:31:21.210,0:31:30.84,thematic instead we've got my call the
0:31:29.429,0:31:33.96,thing I was just working on in my called
0:31:30.840,0:31:35.54,damaged cell yeah I like doing that
0:31:33.960,0:31:38.90,except that it's hard then to go back
0:31:35.549,0:31:41.85,and figure out wall in that when that
0:31:38.909,0:31:45.39,was written right roadog started just
0:31:41.850,0:31:47.49,column June 2014 so when I go back to
0:31:45.390,0:31:49.61,print them all out and I'll you know in
0:31:47.490,0:31:52.47,order to put it anywhere what's what and
0:31:49.610,0:32:01.08,I started organizing my year on my
0:31:52.470,0:32:06.61,computer so what are my documents I have
0:32:01.080,0:32:11.37,a file called poems and within it
0:32:06.610,0:32:13.75,I'll have 2011-2012 the other team
0:32:11.370,0:32:17.47,drafting my book manuscript all parts of
0:32:13.750,0:32:27.72,sole parts returned various other things
0:32:17.470,0:32:32.89,and within 2013 I have early summer 201,0:32:27.720,0:32:41.20,Ecclesiastes January 2013 late summer
0:32:32.890,0:32:42.97,2013 things like that and so those those
0:32:41.200,0:32:44.89,are those are the files those are the
0:32:42.970,0:32:47.89,folders that will hold the individual
0:32:44.890,0:32:52.54,poems yeah okay so then I have drafts of
0:32:47.890,0:32:56.20,a poem notes working on speech for speed
0:32:52.540,0:32:57.79,date and this is a poem I wrote partly
0:32:56.200,0:32:59.65,by taking the first poem I ever wrote
0:32:57.790,0:33:04.03,when I was 12 years old and running it
0:32:59.650,0:33:05.29,through google translate through just
0:33:04.030,0:33:07.33,about every language that they offer
0:33:05.290,0:33:12.07,uh-huh until it came back completely
0:33:07.330,0:33:13.93,deformed into face yeah and still kind
0:33:12.070,0:33:17.29,of it was a really corny poem called on
0:33:13.930,0:33:18.67,light a single candle and if it came to
0:33:17.290,0:33:22.12,speech first become a surrealistic
0:33:18.670,0:33:24.33,speech for a speed a good you enjoy the
0:33:22.120,0:33:26.86,hiss of candle wax and cigarette ash
0:33:24.330,0:33:29.71,here are these include a love of what
0:33:26.860,0:33:32.02,cannot die some of which came out of
0:33:29.710,0:33:36.96,those translations they don't have this
0:33:32.020,0:33:40.87,kind of you know list of what's going on
0:33:36.960,0:33:42.90,and in dress of a poem called reading
0:33:40.870,0:33:45.73,Jesus again with a new prescription
0:33:42.900,0:33:48.96,uh-huh and you'll see I have a whole
0:33:45.730,0:33:52.63,bunch of lines that I'm working on and
0:33:48.960,0:33:55.66,what I often do is just copy those and
0:33:52.630,0:33:57.58,then write some pros about them sort of
0:33:55.660,0:33:59.20,identifying what I like about it what's
0:33:57.580,0:34:01.56,bugging me about it what I don't like
0:33:59.200,0:34:04.93,about it and then paste it back again
0:34:01.560,0:34:07.30,move things around and often I'll put
0:34:04.930,0:34:09.61,bold face when does a revision process
0:34:07.300,0:34:12.22,we don't get to a place that I don't
0:34:09.610,0:34:14.26,like or feels clunky or both faces yeah
0:34:12.220,0:34:17.23,could I come back to it just
0:34:14.260,0:34:20.44,I'm going to fix that okay and then the
0:34:17.230,0:34:22.78,next draft I'll cut it or change it and
0:34:20.440,0:34:27.70,here's a whole section it's all in both
0:34:22.780,0:34:29.88,ya gotta ganging up cut now this is a
0:34:27.700,0:34:35.71,fairly long poem so there's a lot of
0:34:29.889,0:34:37.87,dress in it and then I'll copy it over
0:34:35.710,0:34:40.27,and over until I get it the way I want
0:34:37.870,0:34:42.63,it so all so all drafts are in one file
0:34:40.270,0:34:45.49,yeah and you just keep copying and
0:34:42.639,0:34:47.86,replacing and and folding parts that you
0:34:45.490,0:34:49.99,have problems with even in it and it
0:34:47.860,0:34:51.34,starts in it as it gets towards the end
0:34:49.990,0:34:54.58,of the file it's getting towards its
0:34:51.340,0:34:56.29,final form so like here I'll have the
0:34:54.580,0:34:57.76,draft of that speech for speed date and
0:34:56.290,0:34:59.29,then I'll say clean of cigarette ash to
0:34:57.760,0:35:00.79,candle wax feels a little bland
0:34:59.290,0:35:02.11,intensifies I'll sort of give myself
0:35:00.790,0:35:04.18,instructions like that
0:35:02.110,0:35:06.55,okay tallow might be a better word than
0:35:04.180,0:35:09.73,candle wax you enjoy the clean of
0:35:06.550,0:35:12.37,cigarette ash tutela in various versions
0:35:09.730,0:35:14.98,of it and you'll see a babbling grant
0:35:12.370,0:35:18.82,grant grant yes probably 10 or more
0:35:14.980,0:35:20.08,drafts of it in here so so I'm
0:35:18.820,0:35:22.33,interested in that in the Google
0:35:20.080,0:35:23.74,Translation stuff do you do that have
0:35:22.330,0:35:27.81,you done that before is it the first
0:35:23.740,0:35:27.81,time first time I did that
0:35:28.140,0:35:34.42,well no actually I did that partly with
0:35:31.480,0:35:39.12,one of the poems in Theo phobia it's a
0:35:34.420,0:35:56.80,poem about of the Gospels and a
0:35:39.120,0:35:58.24,meditation on the Gospels and it's the
0:35:56.800,0:36:00.64,poem called
0:35:58.240,0:36:03.19,the kingdom of God is not assured in
0:36:00.640,0:36:05.19,with pomp and exclamations okay and what
0:36:03.190,0:36:07.84,I did with that is I took some of those
0:36:05.190,0:36:10.15,passages of the Gospels and ran it
0:36:07.840,0:36:12.37,through Google Translate uh-huh
0:36:10.150,0:36:15.34,to see what would happen to it so
0:36:12.370,0:36:17.18,there'd be partly recognizable from from
0:36:15.340,0:36:20.77,the Gospels but partly
0:36:17.180,0:36:22.60,different estranged yeah I didn't use
0:36:20.779,0:36:24.38,exactly the phrasing that came at a
0:36:22.609,0:36:27.47,Google Translate but allowed it to shake
0:36:24.380,0:36:29.04,up the familiar biblical canonical
0:36:27.470,0:36:32.83,sayings in such a way that it became
0:36:29.049,0:36:35.08,stranger yeah and and gave me any is
0:36:32.839,0:36:36.68,country phrasing how many had you ever
0:36:35.089,0:36:40.40,before that had you ever done any
0:36:36.680,0:36:43.52,similar practices not that I can think
0:36:40.400,0:36:47.28,of had there been any other computer
0:36:43.520,0:36:56.05,kind of enhanced ways of composing poems
0:36:47.289,0:36:57.98,um not computer enhanced okay um a lot
0:36:56.059,0:37:00.79,of aleatory practices like the dice
0:36:57.980,0:37:04.25,mention in yes in the corpse flower
0:37:00.799,0:37:06.44,called the crab symbol right where a
0:37:04.250,0:37:08.77,roll the dice every day for a period of
0:37:06.440,0:37:14.15,several months went to a page in the
0:37:08.779,0:37:16.91,dictionary worked that way yeah and like
0:37:14.150,0:37:19.91,when you when you in the corpse flower
0:37:16.910,0:37:21.61,they have this dice yeah as the so how
0:37:19.910,0:37:23.02,did you did you do that or is that you
0:37:21.619,0:37:24.50,work with the publisher to do that to
0:37:23.029,0:37:26.83,have the dice appear above the high-tide
0:37:24.500,0:37:28.33,in my manuscript you did have it and
0:37:26.839,0:37:29.86,somebody read the manuscript said no
0:37:28.339,0:37:31.64,publishers that we're going to do next
0:37:29.869,0:37:33.38,is you're going to reproduce dice on is
0:37:31.640,0:37:35.82,different I said yes a they are they
0:37:33.380,0:37:37.52,have to explore the pond yeah and
0:37:35.829,0:37:39.38,University of Western press they're
0:37:37.520,0:37:41.96,great about it see they agree to do it
0:37:39.380,0:37:44.15,oh good yeah and you also I think it's
0:37:41.960,0:37:45.98,in is it that poem or it's in another
0:37:44.150,0:37:50.66,poem of course where you have like so
0:37:45.980,0:37:52.88,like bolded but like shadowed oh in a
0:37:50.660,0:37:54.77,rock boss yeah yeah yeah and is that
0:37:52.880,0:37:57.79,something I mean where does that come
0:37:54.770,0:37:59.56,from I guess that came from a good
0:37:57.799,0:38:03.94,friend of mine who's a geologist and he
0:37:59.569,0:38:07.25,L he collects animal bones who could um
0:38:03.940,0:38:09.10,as part of his research he's very
0:38:07.250,0:38:12.26,interested in the physiology of animal
0:38:09.109,0:38:14.56,skeletons but he um had on his property
0:38:12.260,0:38:16.21,happen to country this thingy called The
0:38:14.569,0:38:19.19,Rock box where he would take animal
0:38:16.210,0:38:20.71,carcasses yeah allow them to rot over a
0:38:19.190,0:38:23.34,winner and
0:38:20.710,0:38:25.35,and then have a date in the fall where
0:38:23.349,0:38:28.11,he would harvest kill harvesting or on
0:38:25.359,0:38:29.97,times that I was with him and actually
0:38:28.119,0:38:32.56,happen to be the date of the war
0:38:29.970,0:38:36.52,Afghanistan story okay
0:38:32.560,0:38:38.26,and so I spent the whole morning helping
0:38:36.520,0:38:40.59,him harvest this Roth office which is a
0:38:38.260,0:38:44.26,matter of taking these skeletons out of
0:38:40.599,0:38:46.06,this big composed decomposing pit yeah
0:38:44.260,0:38:51.31,eating them with bleach in another stuff
0:38:46.060,0:38:53.84,um and it was I don't remember cow
0:38:51.310,0:38:55.96,skulls are not on that sure what it was
0:38:53.849,0:38:57.55,so I spent the whole morning with him
0:38:55.960,0:39:01.05,doing that and then as I was driving
0:38:57.550,0:39:04.03,home just just speaking it you know
0:39:01.050,0:39:06.55,decomposition did you volunteered for
0:39:04.030,0:39:07.90,this job right I hate called me up and
0:39:06.550,0:39:11.98,said you I'm harvesting the Rock box
0:39:07.900,0:39:13.96,ortho knowledge yeah oh yeah if there
0:39:11.980,0:39:18.88,are friendship again right if we hardly
0:39:13.960,0:39:20.47,didn't get rid of but uh that probably
0:39:18.880,0:39:22.54,home from the county I was listening
0:39:20.470,0:39:25.11,right in the bombing had started in
0:39:22.540,0:39:29.89,shock and all it started in them Ganis
0:39:25.119,0:39:32.08,tea yeah so I was thinking about things
0:39:29.890,0:39:34.72,that need compose and words and phrases
0:39:32.080,0:39:36.82,a decomposed okay in other words at
0:39:34.720,0:39:38.83,prices and how did you so how are you
0:39:36.820,0:39:41.14,able to do that on your computer did you
0:39:38.830,0:39:44.32,just we sort of experimenting with the
0:39:41.140,0:39:47.56,fonts and I think what I did is used a
0:39:44.320,0:39:50.14,larger outline time okay so it was the
0:39:47.560,0:39:55.63,words the letters would look hollowed
0:39:50.140,0:39:56.80,out yeah yeah and has you I mean before
0:39:55.630,0:39:59.41,the computer did you ever have
0:39:56.800,0:40:02.08,informations to use sort of fonts like
0:39:59.410,0:40:06.78,that or do any sort of things
0:40:02.080,0:40:09.22,no I didn't yeah um a very interested in
0:40:06.780,0:40:10.51,some of the visual poetics opposed like
0:40:09.220,0:40:12.07,Ronald Johnson yeah
0:40:10.510,0:40:13.83,his early work right which is all
0:40:12.070,0:40:16.30,typewriter based but he does some
0:40:13.839,0:40:18.67,amazing things with the shape of the
0:40:16.300,0:40:22.90,words and the appearance of the words um
0:40:18.670,0:40:25.63,using the typewriter yeah um and you I
0:40:22.900,0:40:28.18,mean and I mean a lot of your poems I
0:40:25.630,0:40:29.74,mean especially if signs of automation
0:40:28.180,0:40:31.66,is where you used I mean a lot of
0:40:29.740,0:40:33.11,punctuation to kind of indicate either
0:40:31.660,0:40:37.25,definitions coming up
0:40:33.110,0:40:38.96,that I mean some of that is rope but
0:40:37.250,0:40:41.03,some of it seems you know that you made
0:40:38.960,0:40:43.49,up yourself I mean yeah where did this
0:40:41.030,0:40:45.41,is that something that you kind of like
0:40:43.490,0:40:47.00,how did that come about like this is the
0:40:45.410,0:40:57.23,question I'm getting a lot of
0:40:47.000,0:41:05.15,punctuation in this new punctuation is a
0:40:57.230,0:41:07.52,kind of separation of sections but also
0:41:05.150,0:41:09.86,is a kind of an element of meaning in
0:41:07.520,0:41:11.72,the poem mm-hmm this poem has a single
0:41:09.860,0:41:14.09,asterisk for the first section 2 for the
0:41:11.720,0:41:17.18,second 3 for the third yeah
0:41:14.090,0:41:20.63,others have crosses yeah
0:41:17.180,0:41:23.00,dividing sections which mean to suggest
0:41:20.630,0:41:25.73,the Christian cross of course but also
0:41:23.000,0:41:28.04,sign of addition your oaken section
0:41:25.730,0:41:32.03,being in addition to the next to the
0:41:28.040,0:41:34.34,previous one let's see what else
0:41:32.030,0:41:36.41,one of my readers this matrix that they
0:41:34.340,0:41:39.08,found they're distracting another's did
0:41:36.410,0:41:42.95,they've been excited I'm hoping for the
0:41:39.080,0:41:44.51,exciting here I have a kind of version
0:41:42.950,0:41:47.69,of this is the one of the Bruce Paisley
0:41:44.510,0:41:50.21,poems okay it's kind of a version of the
0:41:47.690,0:41:51.59,it does not equal son yeah because I'm
0:41:50.210,0:41:53.66,writing about these geometrical shapes
0:41:51.590,0:41:57.95,I'm working with the geometrical shapes
0:41:53.660,0:42:00.20,of punctuation in typography and that I
0:41:57.950,0:42:03.10,suppose where you can do that on
0:42:00.200,0:42:06.77,typewriter head so that's a imported
0:42:03.100,0:42:10.37,symbol for my computer young lady okay
0:42:06.770,0:42:15.05,so that way see here I'm talking about
0:42:10.370,0:42:17.81,the Korean letter which has no sound you
0:42:15.050,0:42:21.47,have to put it I'm learning Korean with
0:42:17.810,0:42:23.15,my son who's who's Korean um it's a
0:42:21.470,0:42:24.92,letter you have to put in front of the
0:42:23.150,0:42:27.29,vowel sound because vowels can't come
0:42:24.920,0:42:29.09,first in a word in Korean okay
0:42:27.290,0:42:31.36,so if you begin with a vowel like an all
0:42:29.090,0:42:34.70,you have to put this null consonant
0:42:31.369,0:42:37.94,front of it huh but it also resembles an
0:42:34.700,0:42:41.86,egg or a zero yeah so I'm working
0:42:37.940,0:42:43.60,visually with the sound of that there's
0:42:41.869,0:42:45.28,a consonant shaped like an egg balanced
0:42:43.609,0:42:47.08,understand that stands for nothing makes
0:42:45.289,0:42:48.38,enough sound mm-hmm
0:42:47.089,0:42:54.14,and I'm connecting that to certain
0:42:48.380,0:42:58.36,hollow geometrical structures and
0:42:54.140,0:43:00.34,brusque Weasley's sculptures so so next
0:42:58.369,0:43:06.07,you're good yeah yeah this is a poem
0:43:00.349,0:43:09.24,this based on in pedigrees the ancient
0:43:06.079,0:43:11.77,philosopher who the read they didn't um
0:43:09.249,0:43:13.48,primordial times they were body parts
0:43:11.779,0:43:17.45,scattered all over the world
0:43:13.480,0:43:19.03,disconnected hearts and lungs and livers
0:43:17.450,0:43:22.50,and that they gradually morph together
0:43:19.039,0:43:25.09,and creating monsters Fortis
0:43:22.509,0:43:26.63,amalgamation of bodyguards until
0:43:25.099,0:43:28.51,eventually they came to a point where
0:43:26.630,0:43:31.19,they the body parts work together in
0:43:28.519,0:43:33.38,form human beings and animals so here I
0:43:31.190,0:43:36.25,have straight syllables scattered all
0:43:33.380,0:43:38.56,over the page you that keep coming
0:43:36.259,0:43:43.09,together and trying to form words yeah
0:43:38.569,0:43:47.50,um like for Mom Kaz mal malformed
0:43:43.099,0:43:48.52,picked I'll fickle cavern us the nuts me
0:43:47.509,0:43:51.98,hello
0:43:48.529,0:43:53.90,you know straight syllables sort of
0:43:51.980,0:43:56.15,groping together to form words and by
0:43:53.900,0:44:00.06,the end of the poem goes on it hmm
0:43:56.150,0:44:02.45,there's a lot of shape the Omega and
0:44:00.069,0:44:07.27,this is also maintained at a balloon
0:44:02.450,0:44:08.74,yeah so a lot of slob of visual shape by
0:44:07.279,0:44:11.21,the time the poem gets to the end it
0:44:08.749,0:44:13.70,makes perfect sense want to come
0:44:11.210,0:44:14.93,together and just into the syllables are
0:44:13.700,0:44:16.24,going to get into words and the words
0:44:14.930,0:44:19.94,that come to get into sentences and
0:44:16.249,0:44:22.99,sentences and coherent units of me sure
0:44:19.940,0:44:26.02,do you write out the sentences in a in a
0:44:22.999,0:44:27.34,more like prose style or I mean like to
0:44:26.029,0:44:28.81,make sure that they're working like that
0:44:27.349,0:44:30.76,I mean like I guess how do you get from
0:44:28.819,0:44:32.41,the notes the line that you know the
0:44:30.769,0:44:35.08,line notes or
0:44:32.410,0:44:37.02,the notes in your computer to something
0:44:35.089,0:44:41.03,that's shaped I guess is a newer thing
0:44:37.029,0:44:44.45,you'd be terrified yes the trances okay
0:44:41.039,0:44:46.55,I have several hundred syllables and and
0:44:44.459,0:44:48.05,into drafts the rule of the poem is that
0:44:46.559,0:44:51.20,once a syllable is introduced it has to
0:44:48.059,0:44:52.97,be repeated elsewhere in the poem is to
0:44:51.209,0:44:55.19,keep repeating and recombining with
0:44:52.979,0:44:58.25,other syllables so I have pages and
0:44:55.199,0:45:00.53,pages of syllables in alphabetical order
0:44:58.259,0:45:03.11,and when they repeat it would scratch
0:45:00.539,0:45:05.36,the mountain so I have AC in a form
0:45:03.119,0:45:09.68,accident and then it would come back as
0:45:05.369,0:45:12.80,accumulate and but any syllable that was
0:45:09.689,0:45:14.03,introduced it was a really didn't echo
0:45:12.809,0:45:17.33,somewhere else in the pole on my way
0:45:14.039,0:45:20.57,down after keep revising until it came
0:45:17.339,0:45:22.76,back yeah so the beginning was just a
0:45:20.579,0:45:25.82,list of syllables not even words just
0:45:22.769,0:45:29.15,miss syllables I guess I'm interested in
0:45:25.829,0:45:31.94,and I mean like your early work is less
0:45:29.150,0:45:34.06,disjunctive ly broken right I mean so
0:45:31.949,0:45:40.97,where do I when did that come in and why
0:45:34.069,0:45:43.34,did that come in started in late 90s I
0:45:40.979,0:45:47.15,guess signs and abominations was a big
0:45:43.349,0:45:50.24,break I think in poetics for me yeah
0:45:47.150,0:45:54.67,much more much more interested in
0:45:50.249,0:45:57.47,fragmentation and disruption and
0:45:54.679,0:45:59.40,imitating disruptive states of mind and
0:45:57.479,0:46:00.63,disrupted states of knowledge with
0:45:59.400,0:46:03.35,disruptions and the poems themselves
0:46:00.630,0:46:05.51,yeah whereas before that I'd been very
0:46:03.359,0:46:08.84,interested in kind of well made poem it
0:46:05.519,0:46:12.32,was coherent and imagistic and lyrical
0:46:08.849,0:46:14.36,yeah um I got bored with that mode and
0:46:12.329,0:46:20.39,wanted to allow the poems become
0:46:14.369,0:46:24.95,stranger and more broken and more
0:46:20.390,0:46:29.21,intuitive and less logical less linear
0:46:24.959,0:46:30.86,yeah and so and it seems like you you've
0:46:29.219,0:46:32.69,kind of got you've went down that path
0:46:30.869,0:46:35.60,and then now you're you've gone down
0:46:32.699,0:46:37.46,that path further inches into oddly a
0:46:35.609,0:46:41.00,more kind of ordered shape a visual
0:46:37.469,0:46:42.68,shape it but uh but how so how does
0:46:41.009,0:46:44.09,sound work in that sense then when you
0:46:42.689,0:46:46.10,see when you're revising you're reading
0:46:44.099,0:46:50.54,them out loud how do you read out loud
0:46:46.109,0:46:53.71,like a poem shaped like an Omega I'm
0:46:50.549,0:46:53.71,here at particular way of reading
0:46:54.170,0:47:00.50,where where try to space out the sounds
0:46:58.190,0:47:03.44,of the letters that are neither side of
0:47:00.500,0:47:05.42,the Omegas that that central absence is
0:47:03.440,0:47:08.12,there okay I mean it's formed by silence
0:47:05.420,0:47:10.13,resident rather than a visual shape on
0:47:08.120,0:47:12.71,the page and is that I mean I guess I'm
0:47:10.130,0:47:14.93,thinking to some of your cage references
0:47:12.710,0:47:16.61,right away we had to say that and so me
0:47:14.930,0:47:18.68,seems like is he a figure that came in
0:47:16.610,0:47:21.23,later to kind of push forward some of
0:47:18.680,0:47:24.14,those products as well or yeah cage did
0:47:21.230,0:47:25.07,a lot of the studies were important
0:47:24.140,0:47:26.96,especially when I was doing that
0:47:25.070,0:47:27.80,aleatory sequence with the dice and
0:47:26.960,0:47:31.67,things like that
0:47:27.800,0:47:34.73,mm-hmm reading paul salon was hugely
0:47:31.670,0:47:37.76,important I think I first read salon in
0:47:34.730,0:47:42.50,the 90s and he's become a giant really
0:47:37.760,0:47:44.06,important figure for me um and Marzian
0:47:42.500,0:47:46.61,that his work speaks to me so it in
0:47:44.060,0:47:49.06,sleep without me knowing would it say
0:47:46.610,0:47:51.23,you not eating rational ones so are you
0:47:49.060,0:47:54.29,sending you're reading it in the German
0:47:51.230,0:47:57.98,know even in trans-like even interpret
0:47:54.290,0:47:59.51,ah it's magnificent to me but I that
0:47:57.980,0:47:59.90,would be very hard cliff to say what it
0:47:59.510,0:48:03.65,means
0:47:59.900,0:48:08.27,oh okay I'm sorry I'm Stephanie is let
0:48:03.650,0:48:12.17,me mine here's a virgin have been
0:48:08.270,0:48:14.09,reading that streaking the eyes to the
0:48:12.170,0:48:16.52,sign be preserved to dragged through
0:48:14.090,0:48:20.87,darkness or stored to life by sand or
0:48:16.520,0:48:22.55,eyes as magnificently suggested to me
0:48:20.870,0:48:25.37,back and we'd not be able to paraphrase
0:48:22.550,0:48:26.90,it yeah yeah
0:48:25.370,0:48:30.67,and I've been working toward a kind of
0:48:26.900,0:48:34.67,poetic sits lets us paraphrase it all
0:48:30.670,0:48:37.19,how do you I mean like so in the in the
0:48:34.670,0:48:41.78,notes and whatnot do you think you could
0:48:37.190,0:48:43.28,trace like a poetics like the
0:48:41.780,0:48:45.41,progression of your poetic but in these
0:48:43.280,0:48:46.94,in these notes in these prose things to
0:48:45.410,0:48:49.22,write while you're writing the poems and
0:48:46.940,0:48:52.96,so you start to kind of reason with
0:48:49.220,0:48:56.12,yourself or something like that and I
0:48:52.960,0:48:57.83,talked to myself yeah which is a way of
0:48:56.120,0:49:00.17,thinking it's a different way of
0:48:57.830,0:49:02.71,thinking then at least I normally think
0:49:00.170,0:49:04.42,right you don't talk to your side
0:49:02.710,0:49:07.81,talk to myself most the time when I'm
0:49:04.420,0:49:10.89,thinking but when I'm writing this sort
0:49:07.810,0:49:14.74,of meditations on the computer I'm
0:49:10.890,0:49:16.75,literally talking to myself to say I
0:49:14.740,0:49:20.20,want to do this why do I want to do this
0:49:16.750,0:49:22.11,and I'm asking myself questions look so
0:49:20.200,0:49:24.76,you're sort of interrogating your own
0:49:22.119,0:49:27.28,practice while you practice exactly yeah
0:49:24.760,0:49:29.41,and you've been doing that the whole
0:49:27.280,0:49:31.57,time pretty much I mean I guess did you
0:49:29.410,0:49:33.70,were you taught how did you anywhere you
0:49:31.570,0:49:35.77,taught this I mean I guess it's it's an
0:49:33.700,0:49:40.44,interesting practice and I'm wondering
0:49:35.770,0:49:42.91,where it coming I was I taught it no I
0:49:40.440,0:49:46.08,didn't I remember doing it in college a
0:49:42.910,0:49:47.92,lot I thought of it then as automatic
0:49:46.089,0:49:49.35,writing you know and I guess I was
0:49:47.920,0:49:51.09,introduced to the idea of automatic
0:49:49.359,0:49:53.80,writing where you just write whatever
0:49:51.099,0:49:57.04,comes into your mind as a generative
0:49:53.800,0:49:59.71,practice yeah for me automatic writing
0:49:57.040,0:50:06.09,sort of became a talking my way through
0:49:59.710,0:50:08.14,a polis or into a poem and and it's a
0:50:06.099,0:50:09.84,practice I get I don't think of it as
0:50:08.140,0:50:11.68,automatic writing anymore I think it is
0:50:09.849,0:50:17.29,just writing is just the way up right
0:50:11.680,0:50:19.15,yeah yeah and so one question that I
0:50:17.290,0:50:21.72,kind of have from a little earlier is
0:50:19.150,0:50:24.40,when you're doing this automatic writing
0:50:21.720,0:50:25.54,in prose and then you have these you
0:50:24.400,0:50:28.39,have a collections of notebooks that
0:50:25.540,0:50:30.64,were written on the typewriter so they
0:50:28.390,0:50:32.26,work they were saved in files like they
0:50:30.640,0:50:33.43,are now so you couldn't go back at the
0:50:32.260,0:50:35.89,end of the year and print them out so
0:50:33.430,0:50:38.95,how how would you print those out daily
0:50:35.890,0:50:41.47,daily okay and you collect them daily -
0:50:38.950,0:50:43.48,so you've been you let me know it's
0:50:41.470,0:50:44.92,literally typing so on a typewriter I
0:50:43.480,0:50:47.32,just save the page you just said on the
0:50:44.920,0:50:48.70,video notebook and then put at the end
0:50:47.320,0:50:50.41,what you do the same thing kind of a
0:50:48.700,0:50:51.82,ritualistic year-end saying where you
0:50:50.410,0:50:55.06,gather them all together or they just
0:50:51.820,0:50:57.22,coming together I would just keep them
0:50:55.060,0:50:59.56,in a box I think until the end of the
0:50:57.220,0:51:01.54,year and bind them up enjoy LeNoble
0:50:59.560,0:51:05.89,yeah and is this something you do like
0:51:01.540,0:51:08.14,every New Year's Day or for now just not
0:51:05.890,0:51:09.73,any particular time just at the end of
0:51:08.140,0:51:10.29,the year sometime you I go around the
0:51:09.730,0:51:11.85,beginning
0:51:10.299,0:51:12.84,summer because I'm sort of looking back
0:51:11.859,0:51:17.30,and what I've read in the year before
0:51:12.849,0:51:19.35,okay and uh and have time to you know
0:51:17.309,0:51:22.32,focus on things like that
0:51:19.359,0:51:24.50,so like now with daytime now I'll
0:51:22.329,0:51:28.92,probably do the last six months
0:51:24.509,0:51:33.13,for the last year um sometimes in this
0:51:28.929,0:51:35.73,summer okay um and then so I guess the
0:51:33.130,0:51:37.42,you know we've talked some we've talked
0:51:35.739,0:51:41.10,a lot about the kind of composition we
0:51:37.420,0:51:43.08,talked some about the revision has the
0:51:41.109,0:51:44.43,revision changed much over your careers
0:51:43.089,0:51:46.42,I mean I mean like you know when you
0:51:44.439,0:51:50.31,when you introduce this more disjunctive
0:51:46.420,0:51:52.63,line break essentially and and got more
0:51:50.319,0:51:58.47,fragmentary did the revising process
0:51:52.630,0:52:00.75,change it didn't it it used to be much
0:51:58.479,0:52:03.45,more in the clarity clarity would be a
0:52:00.759,0:52:05.79,big thing I would revise toward in terms
0:52:03.459,0:52:08.58,of driving out of the poem anything that
0:52:05.799,0:52:12.24,didn't obviously belong to matically or
0:52:08.589,0:52:18.48,to majestically yeah and that's no
0:52:12.249,0:52:19.90,longer really a concern because there
0:52:18.489,0:52:23.01,are all kinds of things happening my
0:52:19.900,0:52:26.14,poems now that don't obviously belong
0:52:23.019,0:52:27.81,together yeah so it's much more
0:52:26.140,0:52:29.34,intuitive than that I guess but I have a
0:52:27.819,0:52:31.92,general sense of what I want to pull
0:52:29.349,0:52:34.77,them to be doing and what is in it and
0:52:31.929,0:52:36.18,what isn't in it and why but it's not
0:52:34.779,0:52:37.29,clarity it's not the thing that
0:52:36.189,0:52:39.91,determines that anymore
0:52:37.299,0:52:45.68,right right would you say that you're I
0:52:39.910,0:52:48.64,mean are you driven by a certain kind of
0:52:45.689,0:52:50.14,driven by sound by meaning I mean what
0:52:48.640,0:52:51.78,is I guess what's the sort of driving
0:52:50.140,0:52:55.15,force of the revision and has that
0:52:51.789,0:52:56.82,changed when you said you said you kind
0:52:55.150,0:52:59.34,of said is you you were moving more
0:52:56.829,0:53:00.84,towards clarity and now but I mean is
0:52:59.349,0:53:02.04,there a sense that the sound is more
0:53:00.849,0:53:03.57,prominent now or
0:53:02.049,0:53:08.04,that two percent is definitely more
0:53:03.579,0:53:09.60,prominent now but also I'm paying much
0:53:08.049,0:53:11.55,more attention to the shape of words on
0:53:09.609,0:53:16.97,the page yeah the visual appearance of
0:53:11.559,0:53:16.97,the words and to the
0:53:21.640,0:53:28.45,and to be clear you usually work in
0:53:24.020,0:53:28.45,Microsoft Word even dominant America
0:53:30.340,0:53:35.30,okay so this is a poem that was
0:53:33.590,0:53:39.55,published in Gettysburg reviews to them
0:53:35.300,0:53:39.55,in manuscript and it's a poem about
0:53:39.790,0:53:44.81,jellyfish moon jellies in particular
0:53:42.950,0:53:47.06,didn't felt such and such and such and
0:53:44.810,0:53:49.76,such one play with the come the
0:53:47.060,0:53:52.84,expression such and such but also the
0:53:49.760,0:53:56.63,Buddhist concept of such as mmm which is
0:53:52.840,0:53:59.51,a term that means emptiness and Buddhism
0:53:56.630,0:54:01.61,but it also means particularity radical
0:53:59.510,0:54:04.04,particularity reductionists of the thing
0:54:01.610,0:54:06.26,is its particularity but it's also the
0:54:04.040,0:54:08.42,awareness that it's empty yeah but it
0:54:06.260,0:54:12.32,has no ultimate reality and it's
0:54:08.420,0:54:15.92,changeable so I started this poem out
0:54:12.320,0:54:17.48,eventually by losing the lines around I
0:54:15.920,0:54:19.58,can't stop watching the YouTube of these
0:54:17.480,0:54:21.98,moon jellies yanking their translucence
0:54:19.580,0:54:28.52,inside out over and over and getting
0:54:21.980,0:54:30.94,nowhere so this is a poem that is in
0:54:28.520,0:54:38.33,four sections because I'm playing with
0:54:30.940,0:54:41.24,quarter natee poorness mm-hmm and and so
0:54:38.330,0:54:43.40,I have many drafts here and part of the
0:54:41.240,0:54:45.71,revision process is condensation if it's
0:54:43.400,0:54:47.69,too long so there I wrote there that's
0:54:45.710,0:54:50.72,not back and it's to bed down to 3,0:54:47.690,0:54:53.00,lines rather than 40 so Tioga outlays
0:54:50.720,0:54:55.31,partly into it and making a note as to
0:54:53.000,0:54:57.08,what that revision did in the revision
0:54:55.310,0:54:59.51,you got something you do always always
0:54:57.080,0:55:04.28,here and then I went through each
0:54:59.510,0:55:07.85,section um cutting things out adding
0:55:04.280,0:55:09.71,things some of lineage feels clunky you
0:55:07.850,0:55:14.69,need to read through and adjust pretty
0:55:09.710,0:55:16.09,happy with that now you know so that
0:55:14.690,0:55:19.89,kind of thing yeah
0:55:16.090,0:55:25.04,revising more for condensation and
0:55:19.890,0:55:26.54,and surprise I guess in disruption and
0:55:25.049,0:55:32.09,surprise rather than clarity and
0:55:26.549,0:55:33.53,consistency yeah but just but still I
0:55:32.099,0:55:37.14,mean but like you said you're working
0:55:33.539,0:55:39.83,with the four part yet theme so you
0:55:37.140,0:55:41.30,still ECU impose a certain order on it
0:55:39.839,0:55:43.55,as well right I mean there's always an
0:55:41.309,0:55:47.19,is that thing something you you do quite
0:55:43.559,0:55:49.07,a bit yeah yeah in terms of different
0:55:47.190,0:55:52.38,things you do and then also quotations
0:55:49.079,0:55:53.25,so so you know so now we kind of you
0:55:52.380,0:55:55.26,know we've gone through a revision of
0:55:53.250,0:55:57.02,doctor composition a little bit and well
0:55:55.260,0:55:59.25,a little bit about it so what how do
0:55:57.029,0:56:01.68,these become a book then I guess is the
0:55:59.250,0:56:04.79,question there and working on exactly
0:56:01.680,0:56:06.90,that this book is how about sold parts
0:56:04.799,0:56:09.76,are turned I'm still playing the title
0:56:06.900,0:56:13.44,your animal or household horns uh-huh
0:56:09.769,0:56:16.01,and it started the concept of the book
0:56:13.440,0:56:17.25,started with a friend who gave me a
0:56:16.019,0:56:19.58,pamphlet I was going through some
0:56:17.250,0:56:20.78,difficult time emotionally about
0:56:19.589,0:56:23.63,something I don't remember what it was
0:56:20.789,0:56:26.94,but he had somebody hand him a pamphlet
0:56:23.630,0:56:28.95,that a new-age shaman gave him mm-hmm
0:56:26.940,0:56:32.49,and it was a pamphlet that said come to
0:56:28.950,0:56:36.18,this workshop for three hundred
0:56:32.490,0:56:38.22,seventy-five dollars you can consult
0:56:36.180,0:56:40.68,with a shaman who will travel into non
0:56:38.220,0:56:42.42,ordinary reality and find your missing
0:56:40.680,0:56:45.76,soul parts and bring them back to you
0:56:42.420,0:56:49.14,and and it said that cause of all
0:56:45.769,0:56:51.56,emotional turmoil upset unhappiness was
0:56:49.140,0:56:53.46,a part of your soul had broken off and
0:56:51.569,0:56:54.77,on the way yeah they had to be returned
0:56:53.460,0:57:00.50,they could only be returned by
0:56:54.779,0:57:04.14,professional and and the professional
0:57:00.509,0:57:07.76,travels into a mystical state and finds
0:57:04.140,0:57:10.38,your soul parts and the pamphlet had
0:57:07.769,0:57:15.56,this statement I hope also parts
0:57:10.380,0:57:17.57,returned and forever see and as it found
0:57:15.569,0:57:20.75,that hilarious yeah that's the problem
0:57:17.579,0:57:22.31,my soul parts and work I'm gone yeah but
0:57:20.759,0:57:24.44,as I started thinking about these poems
0:57:22.319,0:57:27.72,in conjunction with each other I
0:57:24.440,0:57:29.41,realized it made a really I think rich
0:57:27.720,0:57:35.32,metaphor
0:57:29.410,0:57:38.29,fur fur for loss for grief for emotional
0:57:35.320,0:57:39.73,pain yeah and that it pulled together a
0:57:38.290,0:57:41.98,lot of the things I was dealing with in
0:57:39.730,0:57:45.34,this manuscript then also tonally this
0:57:41.980,0:57:46.12,mashup is much lighter and tone a lot
0:57:45.340,0:57:48.52,more humor in it
0:57:46.120,0:57:51.43,and in my other prose okay the sort of
0:57:48.520,0:57:53.95,irony of that commercial language to
0:57:51.430,0:57:58.60,describe something spiritual yeah also
0:57:53.950,0:58:03.01,Bart's returned like it's saying you
0:57:58.600,0:58:06.01,know kills germs dead or something yeah
0:58:03.010,0:58:08.44,it became the sort of overarching
0:58:06.010,0:58:10.12,metaphor so the revision process has
0:58:08.440,0:58:12.04,been want to moving things around and
0:58:10.120,0:58:16.72,structured poems in relation to each
0:58:12.040,0:58:23.14,other so I've got three big parts that
0:58:16.720,0:58:26.35,one part is a long poem called the mass
0:58:23.140,0:58:28.09,of the ordinary which is a kind of
0:58:26.350,0:58:30.22,contemporary Mass uh-huh
0:58:28.090,0:58:33.58,with all the traditional sections of the
0:58:30.220,0:58:41.56,Catholic Mass yeah the KVA in the Gloria
0:58:33.580,0:58:43.54,and Agnes day and all the parts of the
0:58:41.560,0:58:45.61,of the mass and I originally had that
0:58:43.540,0:58:48.01,it's one big chunk it's about ten poems
0:58:45.610,0:58:50.44,very long times I had that all together
0:58:48.010,0:58:51.91,in the beginning and then I have a long
0:58:50.440,0:58:55.06,series called praise song for
0:58:51.910,0:58:56.71,Schopenhauer about philosopher Arthur
0:58:55.060,0:58:59.17,Schopenhauer it's a kind of argument
0:58:56.710,0:59:01.90,with Schopenhauer's pessimism okay so
0:58:59.170,0:59:05.35,the mast is full in toward the court
0:59:01.900,0:59:08.38,autopsy and traditional Catholic faith
0:59:05.350,0:59:09.55,I'm a converted Catholic and and
0:59:08.380,0:59:12.69,children are poems that are pulling
0:59:09.550,0:59:18.37,toward pessimism and nihilism and
0:59:12.690,0:59:19.78,philosophical despair mm-hmm and
0:59:18.370,0:59:21.49,originally I had started with the mass
0:59:19.780,0:59:23.32,and ended with the Schopenhauer poem
0:59:21.490,0:59:25.06,I've been working because it ended up
0:59:23.320,0:59:27.46,with the books being very despairing
0:59:25.060,0:59:29.65,yeah anyway I didn't want to be so what
0:59:27.460,0:59:31.38,I'm doing now is a broken the mass poems
0:59:29.650,0:59:32.95,and the Chopin our poems up in there in
0:59:31.380,0:59:33.57,interspersed all the way through the
0:59:32.950,0:59:38.66,menus
0:59:33.570,0:59:41.31,as it kind of - tugging contrasting
0:59:38.660,0:59:44.04,motifs that are marketing with each
0:59:41.310,0:59:46.05,other all the way through so this is the
0:59:44.040,0:59:48.30,composition of a book like this feel a
0:59:46.050,0:59:49.89,lot like the composition of individual
0:59:48.300,0:59:52.35,poem I mean it's like direct or like
0:59:49.890,0:59:54.54,commencement it does exactly like that
0:59:52.350,0:59:56.25,yeah and has that been the case your
0:59:54.540,0:59:58.68,entire career has that yeah it's
0:59:56.250,1:00:01.77,something you okay yes yeah it feels
0:59:58.680,1:00:04.80,exactly like this a large poem in that

1:00:01.770,1:00:08.37,now the individual poems are the stanzas

1:00:04.800,1:00:10.50,non due to the book what the stanzas

1:00:08.370,1:00:12.12,diggle upon you know - means you can

1:00:10.500,1:00:14.04,move them around and the poem changes

1:00:12.120,1:00:16.89,meaning drastically according to where

1:00:14.040,1:00:18.75,you start and where you end do you

1:00:16.890,1:00:20.91,change the poems

1:00:18.750,1:00:22.02,- once they're in you once they're in

1:00:20.910,1:00:23.13,this order and you're still so you're

1:00:22.020,1:00:24.45,still working on the phone with you

1:00:23.130,1:00:26.48,still and you're working on the book I'm

1:00:24.450,1:00:28.44,working on columns to help them

1:00:26.480,1:00:31.08,illustrate the structure at the boat

1:00:28.440,1:00:32.70,okay so I have a poem that I wrote when

1:00:31.080,1:00:35.76,I was on sabbatical I wrote a poem in to

1:00:32.700,1:00:36.72,write a report to the Provost where you

1:00:35.760,1:00:38.76,tell them what you did on your

1:00:36.720,1:00:40.89,sabbatical and I got the idea that I

1:00:38.760,1:00:42.48,would write that as a poem mm-hmm the

1:00:40.890,1:00:46.25,poem it's got report to the Provost on

1:00:42.480,1:00:49.55,the progress of my leave and like hey

1:00:46.250,1:00:52.11,don't I get one point is the poem about

1:00:49.550,1:00:52.80,losing your soul parts and losing part

1:00:52.110,1:00:54.93,for yourself

1:00:52.800,1:00:57.21,yeah so I thought what if I and that's

1:00:54.930,1:00:59.73,talking to a friend of mine is him and I

1:00:57.210,1:01:01.71,said well wait what if I put the leave

1:00:59.730,1:01:03.86,poem first because then it begins with

1:01:01.710,1:01:06.63,the leaving yeah and first line of that

1:01:03.860,1:01:08.01,when I revised it I realized I could

1:01:06.630,1:01:09.54,move this to the beginning of the poem

1:01:08.010,1:01:11.79,and that's the beginning the book was

1:01:09.540,1:01:16.26,I've gone missing the way someone else

1:01:11.790,1:01:18.03,might go drinking or caroling and so now

1:01:16.260,1:01:21.21,the book is called also parks returned

1:01:18.030,1:01:22.91,and it starts with losing myself you

1:01:21.210,1:01:25.50,know losing control of myself

1:01:22.910,1:01:28.46,emotionally psychologically spiritually

1:01:25.500,1:01:31.19,yeah and so it starts with a sort of

1:01:28.460,1:01:34.49,losing connection with yourself and then

1:01:31.190,1:01:38.06,ends now with a coming back up the cell

1:01:34.490,1:01:39.71,the way I've got it ending now is and

1:01:38.060,1:01:43.91,there's a silly process but I think it's

1:01:39.710,1:01:45.89,going to go this way it's ending now

1:01:43.910,1:01:48.44,with a section that says I'm here with

1:01:45.890,1:01:51.10,most of my soul parts

1:01:48.440,1:01:51.88,none of us just wishing we were here

1:01:51.109,1:01:54.47,mm-hmm

1:01:51.880,1:01:57.17,so he knows from losing soul posture

1:01:54.470,1:01:59.11,beginning because I wanted that title

1:01:57.170,1:02:00.77,also parts return to be ironic but also

1:01:59.119,1:02:03.71,to be what happens in the process of the

1:02:00.770,1:02:06.34,world yeah you know so the book being

1:02:03.710,1:02:08.30,the act of personal shamans and

1:02:06.349,1:02:10.52,shamanism that brings back the missing

1:02:08.300,1:02:12.68,parts of yourself and reiterates the

1:02:10.520,1:02:15.26,episode so you become professionals

1:02:12.680,1:02:19.40,yeah it should hurt turned on soul

1:02:15.260,1:02:21.34,waters yeah let's look at that but I've

1:02:19.400,1:02:23.59,showed the manuscript several friends

1:02:21.349,1:02:25.82,and other poets and haven't felt like

1:02:23.599,1:02:28.04,the overall metaphor to working toward

1:02:25.820,1:02:29.39,is coming through clearly enough you

1:02:28.040,1:02:32.06,know anything it's partly because this

1:02:29.390,1:02:35.72,idea of soul part or treatment is going

1:02:32.060,1:02:37.88,Halon to people who aren't in it in that

1:02:35.720,1:02:40.43,subculture so what I'm planning to do

1:02:37.880,1:02:43.43,now and I'm planning to start on it next

1:02:40.430,1:02:45.44,week even is a brief lyrical

1:02:43.430,1:02:48.95,introduction that describes what soul

1:02:45.440,1:02:52.49,retrieval is okay and it describes the

1:02:48.950,1:02:54.08,shaman is belief that every time you

1:02:52.490,1:02:57.17,endure any kind of trauma a part of your

1:02:54.080,1:02:59.18,soul leaves you and that your soul

1:02:57.170,1:03:01.31,diminished because you've lost parts of

1:02:59.180,1:03:03.10,your soul that are no longer accessible

1:03:01.310,1:03:04.94,yeah and that if they can be restored

1:03:03.109,1:03:08.24,then you'll be restored to wholeness

1:03:04.940,1:03:10.36,um but where the epigraphic I have here

1:03:08.240,1:03:13.01,in a little commit to the metagraph it's

1:03:10.369,1:03:16.94,from a new-age website and it's a

1:03:13.010,1:03:21.44,frequently asked question and um one of

1:03:16.940,1:03:23.89,the questions is my soul parts don't

1:03:21.440,1:03:23.89,like me

1:03:24.480,1:03:28.47,this is from somebody who got their soul

1:03:26.579,1:03:30.83,hearts back but now haunted their soul

1:03:28.470,1:03:32.36,hearts are unhappy to be there yeah and

1:03:30.839,1:03:35.36,the answer is of course they don't like

1:03:32.369,1:03:36.50,you if it is good that you know help

1:03:35.369,1:03:38.84,these people

1:03:36.500,1:03:40.53,first you betrayed them by sending them

1:03:38.849,1:03:42.15,away then you forgot them and left them

1:03:40.530,1:03:47.66,there and now that they are back they

1:03:42.150,1:03:50.60,discover that you're boring that's cute

1:03:47.660,1:03:53.04,so what I'm trying to get at there is it

1:03:50.609,1:03:55.32,you can get your soul parts back they

1:03:53.040,1:03:59.67,may not be happy to be there because the

1:03:55.320,1:04:05.46,soul is not a new series of flickering

1:03:59.670,1:04:07.38,part yeah hi there I think it's in CFO

1:04:05.460,1:04:09.72,be aware you mentioned that was there a

1:04:07.380,1:04:12.35,website up seldom we ask questions may

1:04:09.720,1:04:14.07,happen that you okay I thought that was

1:04:12.359,1:04:16.95,like the funniest thing shit for a while

1:04:14.070,1:04:18.48,tells me that that building once enough

1:04:16.950,1:04:19.98,for the leverage that they'll be really

1:04:18.480,1:04:23.99,good like I better like a here I think

1:04:19.980,1:04:29.09,so don't can that be really funny page

1:04:23.990,1:04:32.67,but yeah I know that well but I mean and

1:04:29.099,1:04:35.13,this too I mean so you seem to use the

1:04:32.670,1:04:38.40,Internet as content and as fodder for a

1:04:35.130,1:04:42.35,lot for poem starting obviously I'm 200,
1:04:38.400,1:04:43.47,so we're worried where does where does

1:04:42.359,1:04:44.60,the internet lie in kind of your

1:04:43.470,1:04:46.47,practice I guess I mean I've seen

1:04:44.609,1:04:49.34,printouts in here and I've seen I mean

1:04:46.470,1:04:50.79,you definitely use a lot of etymology

1:04:49.349,1:04:53.73,and stuff do you go to the internet for

1:04:50.790,1:04:57.15,that you I do a go to Oxford English so

1:04:53.730,1:04:58.44,we D LM on yeah frequently and I have

1:04:57.150,1:05:00.18,all poems in here that came out although

1:04:58.440,1:05:03.05,we deep definitions that are written on

1:05:00.180,1:05:05.22,the Internet yeah I just pull them out

1:05:03.050,1:05:08.09,to have in here it was in the Kenyon

1:05:05.220,1:05:10.07,review called mean meanness and it came

1:05:08.099,1:05:11.79,out of teaching class and dreams and

1:05:10.079,1:05:14.67,poetry and we were talking about what

1:05:11.790,1:05:16.56,dreams mean and what poems mean and then

1:05:14.670,1:05:19.56,I got the idea in class well it's called

1:05:16.560,1:05:23.55,the OED online and look at what the word

1:05:19.560,1:05:25.29,mean means we did that one of them so I

1:05:23.550,1:05:26.67,headed up on screen and the classroom

1:05:25.290,1:05:29.76,and one of the definitions of me

1:05:26.670,1:05:33.69,was an archaic definition that used to

1:05:29.760,1:05:35.61,mean to lament or to mourn uh-huh

1:05:33.690,1:05:38.49,so we were talking about even the word

1:05:35.610,1:05:41.64,mean has multiple meanings that it

1:05:38.490,1:05:43.35,didn't mean to me Anna and how drains

1:05:41.640,1:05:45.15,are multiple the cones are multiple of

1:05:43.350,1:05:48.63,the word mean in words individual words

1:05:45.150,1:05:51.84,are so multiple that you can delimit

1:05:48.630,1:05:55.05,their their their their flux yeah and

1:05:51.840,1:05:56.97,I'm so kept thinking about that and I

1:05:55.050,1:05:59.73,know Brian comb comb mean meaning which

1:05:56.970,1:06:03.20,is about the idea that meaning has

1:05:59.730,1:06:05.76,lamentation or mourning left into

1:06:03.200,1:06:09.11,because meaning can be controlled and it

1:06:05.760,1:06:11.10,can be it can't be packaged it can be

1:06:09.110,1:06:12.21,narrowed down there's something

1:06:11.100,1:06:14.42,wonderful about that but there's

1:06:12.210,1:06:17.55,something more important too yes

1:06:14.420,1:06:18.99,before I say before the internet became

1:06:17.550,1:06:21.27,something that you were able to use

1:06:18.990,1:06:23.55,reasonably what would you turn to to

1:06:21.270,1:06:25.23,kind of do this sort of work I mean were

1:06:23.550,1:06:28.17,you doing this sort of work where you I

1:06:25.230,1:06:31.32,was much more in a library than I am now

1:06:28.170,1:06:33.84,okay so so you can't the internet meant

1:06:31.320,1:06:36.72,the leaving library in some ways yeah

1:06:33.840,1:06:38.46,still smell on tummy letters but yeah it

1:06:36.720,1:06:40.02,allows me to do things right here that

1:06:38.460,1:06:42.63,used to have to go to a lot of great for

1:06:40.020,1:06:45.99,yeah and so how much does research

1:06:42.630,1:06:47.79,inform the poems I mean obviously a huge

1:06:45.990,1:06:50.79,amount and how does that work in

1:06:47.790,1:06:52.29,relationship so I'm usually researching

1:06:50.790,1:06:55.59,while I'm writing when I'm writing those

1:06:52.290,1:06:59.57,paragraphs of sort of thinking and then

1:06:55.590,1:07:03.54,straight lines and things and often

1:06:59.570,1:07:05.52,wondering things alike one of my poems

1:07:03.540,1:07:07.35,head in this manuscript has the line

1:07:05.520,1:07:11.46,I keep wondering if mass and massacre

1:07:07.350,1:07:15.36,have some common root hmm and then I was

1:07:11.460,1:07:18.69,go to the internet and research mass and

1:07:15.360,1:07:21.03,Massacre and copy from the OED the

1:07:18.690,1:07:22.89,definitions yeah and the etymologies can

1:07:21.030,1:07:25.92,paste them into the document at one time

1:07:22.890,1:07:27.78,yeah that kind of thing or I'll start

1:07:25.920,1:07:29.25,thinking about soul retrieval and I'll

1:07:27.780,1:07:30.16,go a whole bunch of soul retrieval

1:07:29.250,1:07:32.25,website

1:07:30.160,1:07:34.80,see what kind of promises they're making

1:07:32.259,1:07:37.75,a fan hilarious that a lot of them don't

1:07:34.809,1:07:40.89,even do it in person he says in $35,
1:07:37.750,1:07:43.15,through PayPal and they claim that they

1:07:40.890,1:07:45.19,from their own home in Virginia or

1:07:43.150,1:07:46.90,wherever it is a journey into not

1:07:45.190,1:07:50.16,ordinary reality in which creep your

1:07:46.900,1:07:53.47,soul parts and one of the questions is

1:07:50.160,1:07:55.93,don't you need to be with me in order to

1:07:53.470,1:07:57.27,bring my console ports oh no or your

1:07:55.930,1:08:00.81,soul parts can be brought back to you

1:07:57.279,1:08:02.65,spiritually and and so is there a

1:08:00.819,1:08:04.42,difference between soul retrievals that

1:08:02.650,1:08:05.98,you in person and ones that you do from

1:08:04.420,1:08:09.09,a distance on those are so just some

1:08:05.980,1:08:11.58,differences people are actually paying

1:08:09.099,1:08:13.93,people hundreds of dollars to claim

1:08:11.589,1:08:16.44,they're returning there so forth so they

1:08:13.930,1:08:17.58,never even met yeah not at least we do

1:08:16.449,1:08:20.50,it in person they blow it they

1:08:17.589,1:08:22.96,supposedly blow it into your mouth who

1:08:20.500,1:08:25.44,they catch the soul parson they have a

1:08:22.960,1:08:28.21,name below those so FAR's into your into

1:08:25.449,1:08:29.88,your lungs did you as research get your

1:08:28.210,1:08:33.69,soul parts returned to you I guess is my

1:08:29.889,1:08:34.87,highest thought about it but they wanted

1:08:33.699,1:08:37.75,to spin that much money

1:08:34.870,1:08:39.73,yeah maybe you can get a grant for there

1:08:37.750,1:08:42.58,is somebody who lives there and teaches

1:08:39.730,1:08:44.79,at Western Louisa academic expert on

1:08:42.580,1:08:45.94,soul retrieval really and I'm thinking

1:08:44.799,1:08:47.92,of going to Tantra

1:08:45.940,1:08:49.35,yeah but I'm not sure I could keep

1:08:47.920,1:08:52.21,straight expected

1:08:49.350,1:08:55.38,did she take the very serious out of it

1:08:52.210,1:08:57.21,dude she doesn't offer the Internet but

1:08:55.389,1:08:58.92,like the burst of all production works

1:08:57.219,1:09:00.75,that saying that it was in Brazil I

1:08:58.929,1:09:07.29,don't think okay she does train people

1:09:00.759,1:09:09.25,on how to do oh wow so uh it was talked

1:09:07.299,1:09:11.50,about books talked about kind of got in

1:09:09.250,1:09:12.88,there I guess one thing you've mentioned

1:09:11.500,1:09:15.42,in passing a couple times or other

1:09:12.880,1:09:17.29,people in in their relationship to your

1:09:15.429,1:09:19.15,process so so where do other people fit

1:09:17.290,1:09:22.21,in I mean that like do they are they I

1:09:19.150,1:09:24.75,know your wife's a poet and a writer and

1:09:22.210,1:09:25.75,you have I'm sure many poet friends I

1:09:24.759,1:09:27.75,mean are they part of the revision

1:09:25.750,1:09:30.96,process part of or are they more like

1:09:27.759,1:09:32.71,kind of general book level process where

1:09:30.969,1:09:34.27,do they come in or are you corresponding

1:09:32.710,1:09:40.21,with them and I read all of each other's

1:09:34.270,1:09:43.84,work um

1:09:40.210,1:09:45.88,and we tend to really tell his work when

1:09:43.840,1:09:48.10,we reach the point with calls exhausting

1:09:45.880,1:09:51.10,our resources means that you've realized

1:09:48.100,1:09:54.70,enough stay here there's nothing nothing

1:09:51.100,1:09:56.95,in the draft that makes you that you

1:09:54.700,1:09:57.91,know you could improve yeah you reach

1:09:56.950,1:09:59.80,the point where you've done everything

1:09:57.910,1:10:03.64,you can do it it's time to get somebody

1:09:59.800,1:10:06.43,else's feedback so Suzanne will read my

1:10:03.640,1:10:08.92,work and she's a really great reader and

1:10:06.430,1:10:10.15,give me really honest feedback on what's

1:10:08.920,1:10:15.94,working well once

1:10:10.150,1:10:19.18,yeah means work and then I have four or

1:10:15.940,1:10:22.66,five friends that I tend to share my

1:10:19.180,1:10:24.67,work with usually accuracies answer it

1:10:22.660,1:10:27.19,memorized it further I'm finding them

1:10:24.670,1:10:29.44,and with the book manuscript so this is

1:10:27.190,1:10:31.87,a stack of different versions that I

1:10:29.440,1:10:34.81,took three different prints of red okay

1:10:31.870,1:10:36.16,and Savannah's read um the one of the

1:10:34.810,1:10:39.67,things I'm doing this week is going

1:10:36.160,1:10:42.46,through the manuscript with all three or

1:10:39.670,1:10:45.37,four versions with marginal comments

1:10:42.460,1:10:48.10,from three different friends and from

1:10:45.370,1:10:50.83,Suzanne getting compared page by page

1:10:48.100,1:10:52.75,and see where their commonalities so

1:10:50.830,1:10:56.11,they all agree that something needs some

1:10:52.750,1:10:57.76,work yeah where they're contradictions

1:10:56.110,1:11:00.10,and think through the contradict yeah

1:10:57.760,1:11:02.17,and are these people that you work with

1:11:00.100,1:11:05.11,are they all poets themselves mostly or

1:11:02.170,1:11:06.64,and are they people the same people have

1:11:05.110,1:11:09.25,been there the whole time where has that

1:11:06.640,1:11:11.80,changed throughout the course mostly

1:11:09.250,1:11:12.94,some of the room two or three of them

1:11:11.800,1:11:15.34,are people I went to graduate school

1:11:12.940,1:11:17.44,with it Virginia come on and we had a

1:11:15.340,1:11:21.55,writing group where we all met once a

1:11:17.440,1:11:23.38,week while we were grad school it would

1:11:21.550,1:11:28.83,sort of continued over over the years

1:11:23.380,1:11:35.32,through the internet yeah anyone is a

1:11:28.830,1:11:37.21,new brand of poet I've met who's just

1:11:35.320,1:11:38.23,spread my manuscript for me and I'm

1:11:37.210,1:11:41.21,ready just managed here for him and

1:11:38.230,1:11:45.46,that's been great um but this is me

1:11:41.210,1:11:46.88,never shared work with him both okay in

1:11:45.469,1:11:48.68,the way is that you corresponding I

1:11:46.880,1:11:50.30,guess earlier work we're by mail are you

1:11:48.680,1:11:52.37,still mostly doing I mean those are

1:11:50.300,1:11:53.78,physical objects I mean you must be send

1:11:52.370,1:11:55.21,them to the send them a description they

1:11:53.780,1:11:57.26,were sent or email the main trip than me

1:11:55.219,1:11:58.48,many active they sitting that notes and

1:11:57.260,1:12:02.21,on that written you can have that answer

1:11:58.489,1:12:07.64,yeah that's nice okay I think I hit over

1:12:02.210,1:12:11.36,here in my falcon falco poems feedback

1:12:07.640,1:12:13.91,from readers and keep all the physical

1:12:11.360,1:12:16.04,copies that of all the poems that have

1:12:13.910,1:12:16.40,come back from the people of children

1:12:16.040,1:12:21.37,too

1:12:16.400,1:12:21.37,yeah which I used a lot in revising

1:12:21.820,1:12:26.36,sortie I mean I think we're pretty close

1:12:23.810,1:12:27.80,I guess I mean I kind of would like to

1:12:26.360,1:12:30.35,ask him if it's one question to me of

1:12:27.800,1:12:32.48,this or search but I mean solve it's all

1:12:30.350,1:12:34.04,over the place but what do you think I

1:12:32.480,1:12:35.63,mean do you think anything fundamentally

1:12:34.040,1:12:37.96,changed you starting to use computers

1:12:35.630,1:12:39.68,more for your writing or do you I mean

1:12:37.969,1:12:43.85,do you think those practices that you

1:12:39.680,1:12:46.55,had before or somehow metaphorically the

1:12:43.850,1:12:51.86,same in a different kind of context

1:12:46.550,1:12:55.73,aminos I would say it's influenced the

1:12:51.860,1:12:59.71,content of my poems more than the more

1:12:55.730,1:13:01.64,than the composition process okay so

1:12:59.719,1:13:03.35,what is the context computers and

1:13:01.640,1:13:05.60,Internet even plus the content of my

1:13:03.350,1:13:10.15,homes a lot you know doing a lot with

1:13:05.600,1:13:11.77,websites with that kind of radical

1:13:10.150,1:13:13.82,interconnectivity of

1:13:11.770,1:13:19.67,associative thinking than the internet

1:13:13.820,1:13:20.48,suggests yeah and I think the dawn of

1:13:19.670,1:13:23.96,the Internet

1:13:20.480,1:13:26.57,probably has a change the way I compose

1:13:23.960,1:13:29.48,my poets in a certain way and that it's

1:13:26.570,1:13:33.86,given permission for a more Associated

1:13:29.480,1:13:38.23,metonymic making notice bit SSA but with

1:13:33.860,1:13:41.65,internet links um I have a poem called

1:13:38.239,1:13:46.91,hyperlinks in tons of abominations that

1:13:41.650,1:13:48.70,is a poem about thinking the way the

1:13:46.910,1:13:50.05,internet thinks in a way in

1:13:48.700,1:13:51.64,everything reminds you of something else

1:13:50.050,1:13:54.37,it takes you to another place so that

1:13:51.640,1:13:56.68,each line of the poem weeps or one one

1:13:54.370,1:14:01.18,idea to another that's only tangentially

1:13:56.680,1:14:03.01,related to the conclusion there are

1:14:01.180,1:14:05.20,certain obsessive themes in that poem

1:14:03.010,1:14:09.67,having to do with the birth of my son

1:14:05.200,1:14:12.36,and adoption and purification and

1:14:09.670,1:14:15.37,rituals of sort of preparing for

1:14:12.360,1:14:16.27,fatherhood but they're oblique and

1:14:15.370,1:14:17.74,they're associative

1:14:16.270,1:14:19.78,yeah and that I think was one of the

1:14:17.740,1:14:23.35,first poems where I consciously wrote a

1:14:19.780,1:14:25.48,poem whose thinking was related to the

1:14:23.350,1:14:28.33,way I think the internet thinks if we

1:14:25.480,1:14:34.09,can call the internet a thinker in some

1:14:28.330,1:14:35.83,ways it yeah you know I mean yeah but it

1:14:34.090,1:14:37.87,hasn't really changed my composition

1:14:35.830,1:14:40.03,process a whole lot because I was doing

1:14:37.870,1:14:42.73,some typewriters what I'm now doing on

1:14:40.030,1:14:48.03,computers you know it's made it easier

1:14:42.730,1:14:50.38,to cut and paste and move things around

1:14:48.030,1:14:51.88,but I can do that on note cards in

1:14:50.380,1:14:53.98,writing anyway rather than on the

1:14:51.880,1:14:57.43,computer yeah because there's something

1:14:53.980,1:14:59.50,about writing out the sections of a poem

1:14:57.430,1:15:01.57,on a card and then moving them around it

1:14:59.500,1:15:04.11,I found more satisfying even than doing

1:15:01.570,1:15:04.11,it on the computer

1:15:08.520,1:15:13.83,so I'm using it especially my newest

1:15:11.010,1:15:18.54,poems a lot of material that's based on

1:15:13.830,1:15:21.81,because the physicality of icons and

1:15:18.540,1:15:24.51,things of them that are possible from a

1:15:21.810,1:15:26.94,computer let me show you some other

1:15:24.510,1:15:29.43,example here's some more shapes that I'm

1:15:26.940,1:15:33.68,using in that poem there's an X and a

1:15:29.430,1:15:33.68,wine then an Omega yeah

1:15:35.960,1:15:47.31,and I'm using fear of reproductions of

1:15:43.830,1:15:48.78,the Bruce basil cultures yeah which of

1:15:47.310,1:15:53.10,course would be possible without the

1:15:48.780,1:15:57.24,internet but I'm doing more visual

1:15:53.100,1:16:01.86,collisions between text and between text

1:15:57.240,1:16:03.30,and image yeah that it's suggested by it

1:16:01.860,1:16:07.11,bye bye the Internet

1:16:03.300,1:16:08.91,yeah well that's it okay thank you very

1:16:07.110,1:16:11.84,much that's great

1:16:08.910,1:16:11.84,we threw these off
