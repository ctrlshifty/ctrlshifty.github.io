"always strats poem in long-hand, writing it over and over by hand, then moves to computer then prints out, etc. ",between;paper,"it's always been going back and-I mean, it's mostly handwritten over, and over, and over, and over, and over again, starting from the beginning. I never have been able to do it any other way. First word first. First syllable first. All the way to the end."
most pieces come differenlty than others though; has finished some poems 25 years after starting,prompt;revision,"It really is like doing problems, I think. At that stage of composition, at least. The ideas kind of that you get something that compels you. Isn't that how it is? It drives you through till it's finished, and that finish may take a while or not. It might take forms, there can be snags along the way. There can be endings that don't come, but it isn't linear-there are problems that occur. Structural problems, and so forth."
early benefit of computer was simply not having to re-type so much,early,"Again, it was great to be able to change things without typing them all out again-and that's pretty much all you could with it."
"writes on white and yellow paper, folding the white paper in half and writing over the halves, then tucking them together",paper,"What I do is I take a piece of white typing paper-usually it has something written on the other side of it-I will fold it in half, and I will start writing on one side of it. And, you know, if that goes on-if it's longer than that-I will go to the other side. And then when I have to store them, I will shove them together, you know, in a way that they can be folded-in inside, and the latest one will be on top. But also, I will write on yellow pads, and that'll come into the process."
"averse to learning more than necessary about back up procedures, etc; employs a computer guy to manage system",future;files,"I don't know how they do that but I'm pretty ignorant of all these stuff, and willfully so. It just would suck up too much of my time to learn about it."
stores his paper copies in brown boxes that dot his office,future;paper,"My office is filled with stacks of brown boxes, as you might remember. It's all a big mess and a big pile."
"focus for poem is that it come into its own as a thing, realizes itself as the best possible poem it can be",revision,"So again, it's just my audience for a poem is the poem. What anybody else thinks of it-or even what I think of it-doesn't matter at all. To me, what I want to do is get the poem to come off of the page and become a thing."
essentially works on the computer with his poems much like he worked on the typewriter,revision;early;change,"Essentially. I mean, I guess maybe sometimes I do make little changes on the screen. You know, if I'm typing it up again or something, that will perhaps provoke-probably very minor-changes."
ability to look up etymologies and rhymes online = greatest change to writing process due to computer; remarkably consistent practice throughout,change,"But I have looked up-I confess-rhyming pairs. There are rhyming dictionaries online. So, sometimes I've used those just to see what the options are."
physical problems using the computer one reason he's used computer less for some writing,paper; early;change,"Also, I'm having some physical problems using computers, and probably heading for a shoulder surgery this summer, so it's not physically comfortable to spend too much time on it. But mostly, even before that, I don't like to read off the screen."
screens not native to him; paper is,paper;change,"I like having a physical thing in my hands to read from. That's native to me. I mean, screens didn't come in any significant way until about 15 years ago."
