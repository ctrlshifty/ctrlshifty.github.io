gluck,"Reading poems backwards divorces editorial attention from meaning and refocuses it toward syntax and mechanics. ",revision,"[reading mss backwards] Oh yeah. I still do that. It's horrible, and you need someone to help you. Your eye makes substitutions, so unless you read it out of order&#8212;i.e. backwards&#8212;you're going to be doing that."
gluck,"Teaching is an integral source of inspiration—and a way out of writer's block.",teaching,"The minute I started teaching, I started writing again. I still feel about teaching that it's the most miraculous thing I've ever discovered, because I can't always write, and long periods go by and I don't write. But I can always teach, and I will always meet people who fascinate me and who are doing things, who have minds that go places my mind has never gone. "
gluck,"Entire manuscripts are sometimes revised at the line level due to the late addition of a single poem or other new element. ",mss;revision,"Yeah, and then sometimes there will be a massive revision. One edition to an accumulating manuscript makes it clear how the thing should be ordered, and then you see you can make a lot of short, little changes in the other stuff because of this new thing."
gluck,"The repetitve nature of the typewriter aides in revealing previously missed issues in a poem.",paper;early;highlight;revision,"So it's a new sheet of paper, and you have to do the whole thing again, and problems emerge in those retypings, like your fingers will hesitate over something you thought was resolved, and you realize it's not resolved."

gluck,"A slower writing practice lends more clarity to larger, holistic revision and structural considerations.",mss;revision,"You learn how to be an editor out of a sense of lack, and from that grows a capacity to organize disparate things into something that has a sense of dramatic shape."
gluck,"The visual experience of seeing a poem on paper is how a poem is truly heard.",paper,"I hear with my eyes. I mean, the experience of reading a poem&#8212;for me, with my eyes&#8212;contains an oral experience."
gluck,"Feedback is important, but from whom it is requested varies in accordance with the particular poem or project. ",correspondence,"They change. I mean, it's certain periods, certain people. Sometimes, you'll feel these poems&#8212;if they're ever going to be understood by anyone&#8212;will be understood by X. And you're usually right&#8212;when X says, This won't do, you trust it, because the person is basically on the side of the work."
gluck,"Composing on a screen inhibits otherwise natural and fluid stylistic choices about line and diction.",paper;early,"I don't get that on the screen. I don't see lines on the screen quite the same way, and I don't feel as though I'm making the letter."
gluck,"Judging the Yale Younger Poets Series and working on final manuscripts with winners was a joy, and one not unlike that found in teaching. ",yaleyounger;teaching,"Then I would make very detailed recommendations, which they were free to not take because the book had won. On the other hand, they weren't free to change the books any which way because I could say, This is not the book I chose."
gluck,"Finalists for the Yale Younger Poets Series were filtered through a pre-screened team of readers, a system that ensured a diverse final round of manuscripts.",yaleyounger,"I had great people screening for me and they were people whose judgments I trusted and who sent me very broadly diverse manuscripts."
gluck,"Though all composition is done on paper, digital proofs are reviewed. But then it's back to paper for any changes or fixes.   ",between,"I cannot imagine typing poems on that board."
gluck,"Though archived, most original drafts and documents are either typed on a typewriter or written longhand, and with very little marginalia/notation.",early; future,"It's one of the reasons that my papers are not valuable, because there will be pages with little scribbles, but usually I just put in a new piece."
pinsky,"Early drafts are printed out for notation, then memorized and recited for revision.",prompt;between;revision,"See if you have the poem by memory. Turn the light off while going to sleep and try to recite the poem. If you come to a part you don't have memorized, maybe that's the part you need to work on."
pinsky,"The process of a poem's creation involves both digital and analog methods, but physical engagement with the poem—printouts, oral recitation, etc.—is most integral.  ",between; paper,"I do all of the above. I write longhand on paper, I compose on a computer, more process of revising."

pinsky,"The final venue for a piece of writing—the screen or printed page—determined how the piece would be composed. ",early;software,"For a long time, anything I wrote to be read on the screen, I wrote on the computer and things I meant to be read off paper, I wrote on paper."
pinsky,"The IBM Selectric was a favorite tool for composition.",early,"It was like a BMW. It was such an excellent machine—that golf ball click-click-click."
pinsky,"The early 80's computer game Mindwheel was composed entirely on an Atari.",early,"I still remember that monochrome, yellow, black-on-yellow monitor that weighed more than anybody's big flat screen TV. It was immense."
pinsky,"Computer skills have been self-taught over the years, a process which has benefited from having began in the early days of computers.  ",early,"Adept is a relative term compared to all the other writers and poets I know. I guess I'm adept compared to any 15-year-old. I try hard."
pinsky,"The ease of inserting passages on computers may have led to an increase in bloated prose.",early;change,"I've met an editor who said she thinks prose declined—people started writing much more poorly—when the computer made it so easy to insert passages."
pinsky,"Though digitally stored in a meticulous manner, old drafts are considered of little value beyond occassional review later on.",files;future,"I look at it and I sometimes feel the way I told you I feel about the family photographs. Nobody wants all this."

pinsky,"Writing letters to other writers has been used as a warm-up for writing poetry.",change;correspondence,"I used to write a lot of letters. They used to be a way I would warm up."
pinsky,"The generation of new content immediately follows inspiration—very little precedes the writing of the first lines. ",prompt,"I have never kept notes. I'm not a note maker. I would get an idea for a poem and I would write it."
pinsky,"The true beginning of a new draft comes from an attention to sound—the actual material content is secondary.",prompt,"The poem starts when you start thinking about the vowels and consonants."
pinsky,"The ordering of a manuscript is intuitive, but involves an attention to the introduction and subsequent amplification of new ideas and thematic elements.",mss,"I guess it's different for each book. I'm not sure how to answer. It's intuitive."
pinsky,"The initial draw to poetry was in response to its more oral tradition.",career,"This was more physical in some way. More bodily, let's say."
pinsky,"Digital archiving has lead to a new anxiety in regard to the longevity of stored documents.",future,"The new anxiety is the mortality of digital information."
pinsky,"Many word processors have been used over the years, such as Nissus Pro, Scrivner, Word, and Word Perfect, but ease of use and simplicity of the program is most important.",software,"In a way, I use all of the above but I'm not loyal to any particular word processor."
beasley,"The internet facilitates leaps in thought, association, and poetic imagination.",change,"Computers and internet have influenced the content of my poems a lot, doing a lot with websites, with that kind of radical interconnectivity of associative thinking that the internet suggests. I think that the dawn of the internet probably has changed the way I compose my poetics in certain way, and that it has given permission for more associative, mimetic thinking process that I associate with internet links."
beasley,"How the internet thinks in relation to poetic composition.",change,"And that, I think, was one of the first poems where I consciously wrote a poem whose thinking was related to the way I think the internet thinks&#8212;if we can call the internet a thinker."
beasley,"Ongoing value of paper processes.",paper;change;between,"There is something about writing out the sections of a poem on a card and then moving them around that I find more satisfying even than doing it on the computer."
beasley,"Contemporary practice involves a necessary back & forth between paper and screen. ",prompt;paper;printdig;between,"I can write individual lines by hand. When it comes to a whole poem, I do it almost exclusively on the computer. This one says, Even the evenings are odd, even the odds are even/ offspring, autumnal, equinox, off kilter, which are not lines I ended up using but often, when I'm doing this kind of walking, I'll end up with a stack this big of note cards, and then when I'm at the computer, I shift them around and type them up, and rearrange them and shuffle them and move them into different places."
beasley,"If stray words and lines are generative rolls of the dice, digital composition deals a hand (for more on this & related processes, see Bruce Beasley's Prompt Generator).",prompt;paper;printdig;between,"I'm a big fan of craps and gambling, and I like to think of words as, like, rolls of the dice, in a way. So often when I'm beginning a poem, I'll start with the straight lines and images, or phrases, quotations&#8212;like this&#8212;and then when I'm sitting down with a computer, I'll deal them out with something like&#8212;You're in geometry."
beasley,"Archiving involves a yearly retrospective of digital files, and the chance to revisit both stray lines and process notes. ",paper;future;between,"The other thing I do&#8212;you might be interested in&#8212;is once a year I print out all the notes, all the computer writing I've done. I keep them in a bound journal that is by year. So this one, for example, is 1999&#8212;and you'll see that a lot of times, when I work on the computer, I'll write a kind of journal, just sort of what's going on and what I'm thinking about, and working with stray pieces of poems that I've written down by hand."
beasley,"Tecnology has had less influence on composition process, and more on the ways poems take physical shape. ",early,"So just doing essentially what I do now&#8212;large chunks of prose that would lead to ideas and sort of mull through ideas&#8212;but I was typing it on a Selectric typewriter."
beasley,"If the internet facilitates a leaping quality of thought, walking and flipping offer complementary rhythm.",prompt;revision,"There is something about the action, repetitive action of throwing and catching, that's always been really important to generating ideas. It's similar to the kind of rhythm I have when I'm walking, I think&#8212;that kind of rhythmic catch and release. So often when I'm writing, all through my life, I have kept this thing with me and I flip it while I'm thinking. Often, I can't think unless I'm doing that. It's a kind of kinetic thing, I think, and when I'm walking, often I have a stick, a stick that I'm flipping or throwing around, too."
beasley,"Transitions from screen to page become an exercise in fruitful disorder. ",printdig;prompt;revision,"I just let lines accumulate, images accumulate, phrases&#8212;until I have a whole series of pages of drafts. Then I'll start worrying about it. I try not to make myself&#8212;I know poets who write from the first line on: begin with the first line and then write the second one. Linda Bierds once told me she writes that way, which astonished me because it's so utterly unlike anything I do. But I really try, especially when I write long poems&#8212;which a lot of my poems are&#8212;not to impose any order on it until I've got pages and pages of lines. Then I'll print them out."
beasley,"Files organization goes hand in hand with revision process. ",files;revision,"You'll see I have a whole bunch of lines that I'm working on, and what I often do is just copy those, and write some prose about them&#8212;sort of identifying what I like about it and what's bugging me about it, what I don't like about it&#8212;and then paste it back again, move things around. Often, I'll put bold face when this is a revision process, when I get to a place that I don't like or feels clunky, I'll bold face it so that I can come back to it and just say, What am I going to do to fix that?"
beasley,"Spare time on the job as key to first-book drafting. ",career,"There was an old, famous ad campaign for Maytag washing machines, and the joke of it was that the washing machine never broke down; so they had Maytag Repairs, and the Maytag Repairs people were just really bored, they had nothing to do. So, I had a sign on my desk that said Maytag Repairs. But I had a lot of spare time, so I would write a lot at work on my typewriter&#8212;this was before computers. So, I wrote a lot of my first book in those jobs."

mcmichael,"Writing process stayed the same until final book, so until about 2010 or so",early;prompt; between;paper,"The process through all of the books until this most recent one was all long-hand and then typewriter"
mcmichael,"moving from long-hand to typewriter was a producitve and often pleasurable break/move that he repeated over and over to write his books, even on long sections",between;paper;revision,"There's 16 sections of it of varying lengths, and I'd do it section by section. It was pretty much chronological, but some of the sections were 16, 17 pages long, so I'd go through the whole process for that particular section. You know, if I were typing up what I'd recently added 4 or 5 lines to, I'd probably type the whole thing again"
mcmichael,"With last book, found he didn't miss the typing stage and that the notetaking, typing, and revision stages all started to meld",change; between,"There was, as I said before, a surprise that I wasn't at all missing the typing—the typing stage probably because it was all typing. So, it was as if... That's what's happened with this machine—was the long-hand and the typing just coalesced and because the same activity."

mcmichael,"highly idiosyncratic note-taking technique, with mutli-colored references and interpretations of previous notes",paper; prompt,"these are the notes that I would take for the book that I'm reading. The RED is the more important material. It's something that, if I'm going through it I can read and just pick out the highlighted parts, then GREEN are my own responses. So, I'm always working on the right hand page when I'm taking notes from books I'm reading, then when I'm going back over the material, I'll work on this page and there'll be other changes. Usually more GREEN will turn up."
mcmichael,"Doesn't write drafts; instead writes whole book poem by poem line by line; mss just one file with most recent additions, written poem by poem, line by line",files; mss;revision,"I work on them almost only cumulatively so that I take them along line by line. I don't...I'm not able to write a draft of something."
mcmichael,"Major changes in writing practice more due to realization of content and improvement of practice/standards rather than technology",change,"After I wrote the Vegetables, I had a standard that I had to apply all the time. And once it was in place, then I had something to work with besides form (I had form, too, but I had form before when I was filling form with bad phrases)."
mcmichael,"loves non-invasive quality of computer, especially for corresopndence",correspondence; ,"But I love how non-invasive this [the computer] is as a medium—not so much in terms of my being protected against being invaded by somebody else, but being able to say something (send somebody something here [on the computer]) and understand that they can open it when they want, and that it's not an imposition on them."
mcmichael,"music, starting with jazz then moving to rock and roll, and finally staying with classical, had a profound effect on practice, especially on form and length of individual poems ",change; revision,"I think there's a non-accidental relationship between the forms I was working with having been as short as a 3-minute take and a sonata form, or a scherzo trio form, or an adagio, or something like that that the lengths of it (the units I was working on ) got larger when I was listening to pieces of music that were 8-9 minutes to ½ an hour long."

vanwinckel,"Drafts every project by hand, in a separate notebook/space. ",paper;prompt,"I work in longhand, on yellow legal tablets, or just whatever. I have different notebooks that I have. That's what all these notebooks are here; these are my various writing projects in process. They each get their own little notebook."
vanwinckel,"Cleans up digital archives as each project is published. ",future;files,"Yeah, I save them as Word docs and then when I'm done with them and the books are published, then I just put them on a back-up disk and take them off my hard drive here."
vanwinckel,"Lifiting spacial limitations re: which poem(s) start on which pages creates opportunity for new poem ideas via association, juxtaposition. ",paper;revision;change,"So yeah, early on - one of the things that's different now- is that early on I would probably just work on a poem, so I would write. I would have a page in my notebook, and there were lines, and I would move things around on the page, and then I would have another page in the notebook with a different poem. But over the years I've started working on maybe two or three poems almost kind of simultaneously, on the same page, which feels kind of nutty, but what I was experiencing that led me this way was that a lot of times things would be coming to me - images, lines --- that didn't seem to belong to the poem I thought I was working on. So I realize it might be helpful to not confine myself. So that's why that was one of the main transitions. I think that happened maybe half-way along. In the late-eighties or so I started experimenting with that and I liked it. I liked having just a page with a poem one margin, and another going down another margin, and one going across the bottom. Something like that."
vanwinckel,"Same-page drafting segues into poem series', informs manuscript structure. ",change;mss,"And then I liked that. I like working in series so much when I was writing that book that I also just decided I wanted to keep moving in that direction. I liked those series poems. And they maybe lent themselves more to that practice with several poems happening at the same time in early draft stages."
vanwinckel,"Immersion-style writing process--by hand, or in her head--for stories versus poems. ",paper;prompt,"So much is going on. I go out and I take a walk every afternoon in this park. It's actually part of my writing process. I take a walk in the afternoon, and it's like 'shut up' I'm just trying to take a walk!' People are talking in my head. It feels like this overpowering thing when I'm working on a story. It just comes over me and wakes me up in the morning. People wake me up in the morning. They are chattering away. It's very unnerving. I often push back at a story until I am really sure that I have quite a few of the building blocks in place. Because otherwise it just seems like a struggle and a fight. And it's going to occupy - it takes me like 10 ten-hour days in a row for a story."
vanwinckel,"Teaching inspired initial foray into fiction. ",career;teaching,"So, I think I just accidentally taught myself to write fiction by trying to help my students make their stories better and trying to diagnose: 'What does this story need?'"
vanwinckel,"Necessity of teaching fiction as a poet inspires unexpected bank of story ideas.",career;teaching;prompt;early,"I remember so many days walking to my fiction writing class and trying to think about what I was going to say to this writer about her story-how to address its troubles-and I realized that I was internalizing all of this. And then the first time I got a sabbatical, I remember I was driving into Chicago for a little adventure for the day (and I was so happy I had this sabbatical I was going to work on poems, of course) and I got this idea for a story. I remember I was just writing on my car seat while I'm driving-just this little note to myself about what the story-kind of just a synopsis, like one sentence of what it would be. By the time I got in to Chicago, I had 5 story synopses written on this piece of paper, and then I just came home. That's what I did for my whole sabbatical-I wrote a bunch of stories and that was the 1st book of stories. Limited Lifetime Warranty, it was called."

I have notebooks and notebooks where I have a big X through the page so that I do not get confused that I'm actually done with this version, and now if I look hard enough in the notebook, there is a later version of these poems. But I throw the old, ripped up pages in the back of the notebook, and there's a newer version somewhere in there. But the older ones are fatter and often&#8230; I'm also experimenting with line break, then too, with the shaping issues&#8230;"

I'm less inclined to fiddle with line lengths once I've got it on the computer. I do that. For some reason it still feels easier for me to do it on the page because like I just stick my slashes in there."

vanwinckel,"Digital composition now happens in the moment, not just via transcription or revision.",career;change;between,"Well, I think it's mostly been gradual. I've grown more comfortable doing some revision work on the computer and especially with the fiction, and maybe because fiction still feels like a newer form to me. One shift that has felt a little bit more dramatic with composing is that I have found myself, when I'm working on short stories, actually doing some new composing work right here while I'm sitting. Like I'll be working on a story thinking&#8230; I'm typing in from my notebook&#8230;"

mohammad,"Though composition, revision, and manuscript assembly happens almost exclusively in a digital environment, the actual files aren't necessarily cared for as one might think. Could this be because Mohammad's was a writing practice born in a digital environment, where he feels more at home, less anxious, than others?",files,"Oh, no. I don't. I probably should, but I almost never save drafts. I just open up a doc and write over it until I think it's finished."

And in the middle of that process, I'd usually get rid of most of the language—some of the language I couldn't figure out what interesting things I could do with, or that wouldn't be interesting."
mohammad,"Finding unusual and pleasant combinations of the language itself takes precedence over finding or constructing new meaning.",revision;prompt,"You know, it didn't matter what it said in the traditional sense. I was interested in, like, Wow! How can you put those words in that place!"

At that stage of composition, at least. The ideas kind of that you get something that compels you. Isn't that how it is? It drives you through till it's finished, and that finish may take a while or not. It might take forms, there can be snags along the way. There can be endings that don't come, but it isn't linear-there are problems that occur. Structural problems, and so forth."

And, you know, if that goes on-if it's longer than that-I will go to the other side.

gerstler,"She's focused on the low-tech, tactile facets of textual production and revision--how these influenced the making and copying of text--before transitioning to the computer. ",early;paper;between,"Well, this now gets to era and what generation I am, because I'm 57, so when I started writing it was typewriters, you know? I took a typewriter to college and it moved from-you know, I took typing in high school-and it went kind of quickly during my little time capsule of when I was sort of coming up. From portable typewriters and little cute cases that were sort of like a big lunch box with a little handle, to increasingly kind of complicated electric typewriters. With all their weird accoutrements like carbon paper and white out, or weird-they started making typewriters that actually had a correcting tape in them. It was like white and you would type over the letter that you wanted to correct with this white, chalky strip that was in there as part of the typewriter. Before you had to like shove a weird little piece. So, all these kind of very low-tech-viewed in hindsight-ways of dealing with making texts, correcting texts, revising texts, and also copying text. And then to the first sort of big-I remember when, you know, I first got a computer. It was sort of like, you know, I was ZZ Top. I had a tall music system here-it was this big, bulky thing, and there were things that went under the desk. And the printer had like-the print was really ugly looking."
gerstler,"Tension between an allegiance to paper drafting and the insubstantial nature of typing paper--how this fragility almost seemed to impact the poems themselves. ",early;paper;between;revision,"When I started writing poems when I was a kid-before I had access to a typewriter or learned to type-it was, you know, spiral-bound, lined notebooks. And then it kind of moved to typing things, which you'd think would have made me revise a lot, and I did revise, but I love computers. Every time you wanted to change a period, or move texts around, you had to retype everything. And you were sometimes dealing with these crappy kinds of paper like that onion skin-it was erasable, but it was so like thin and fragile and weird-looking, and tactilely bizarre, and kind of see-through-y. And made the poems seem like they were really not substantial. Smeared easily."
gerstler,"Compared to typing, digital revision allows for quicker, more streamlined experimentation with form, lineation, and shape.",between;revision;change,"What I like is I can take a chunk of text and move it up here and it doesn't take me 40 minutes to retype the whole damn thing. And if I don't like it, I can try it down here. And if I want to print out a copy of something as a prose poem, and a copy of it with some line breaks, and look at them next to each other, I can do that in a flash. All that? I couldn't be happier. Because then I'm spending my time reading and writing and revising, and not spending my time [makes typing sound]. Oh! Now I have to do the whole thing all over again!"

You know what I mean? Or something like that. And I love research. Research is, to me, such a rich, poetic, amazing exploration, and is full of the unexpected. Like-this is another thing that relates to sort of digital stuff, at least in my mind-one of the only things I miss about pre-digital is card catalogs, because, thumbing through a card catalog, I would be taken on many more weird tributaries than I get doing a computer search in a library on whatever. You know, I'd be looking up the history of ferns or something, and I'd come across the history of shock treatment, and I'd be like, Oh, that's way more interesting than ferns. What do we got here? And then go find that book or something. So, that I kind of regret, the way computer indexes are set up. It's actually a little harder to find things, I think, on topic.

Whereas that would be serendipitous in a kind of journalistic- or factual-type research, and it would be totally the point in more poetic or literary research may be."
gerstler,"Likens manuscript production process to interior design, awarness of shape and cover art as well as balance between darker and lighter subject matter. ",mss;change,"More or less. For me, if it's a book of poems, some books of poems are sort of like a scrapbook, or a portfolio, or something, and some of them are more thematic, or the book itself has some kind of looser type-in my case, it's usually loose-structure, or trajectory. And even the ones that are kind of a sampler, I spend a fair amount of time trying to figure out, What's the first poem? What's the last poem? What's the movement? How do they work together? How do some of the last lines of ones feed in to the title or the first line of the next one? What looks good next? In a way, it's sort of like, though it's not exactly like, interior decoration-you want it to flow, have ups and downs. With me, it's like, What's the mixture of dark and funny ones? I mean, you do mini version of that when you're reading, even. And then sometimes it's like, Oh, this is going to be in sections, and, Are these sections going to be numbered? It's basically manuscript construction, right? And if you're dealing with-I mean, I've been really lucky in being able to pick a verse because, you know, it's a funny thing with poems. It's like hardly anybody publishes poems anymore, and if you're lucky enough to get a book of poems published, usually they're not treating it like it's, you know the next big best-seller. They don't have a big investment in it. So, the fact that it's much less a big deal to them has its pros and its cons, but one of the pros is, usually, they're not going to impose a cover on me, because it's not like, Well, this is going to be a blockbuster, and therefore, we need to have this kind of cover. So, I get to pick covers by artists that I like usually. So, thinking about that, and how the title-the overall title of the book-where that's going to come from."

But you wouldn't be sitting there over the phone going, OK, in paragraph 3, about the middle, this sentence, this word-you know what I mean? Again-making things much more efficient, speeding things up. And also, it was a lot about-for me, but I don't think I was alone in this-a lot about learning curve. Figuring out how to use the computer, and what you could do with it graphically, also, with poems. Because suddenly, you know, on a typewriter and on the early computers, you couldn't play with typeface, you couldn't play with type size. People who wanted to make concrete poetry or poetry that uses, you know-they really worked hard. You know, all those guys back in the day they worked hard to get that written and then made sure that it went in to print as the artistic, graphic, on-the-page creation that they wanted to make."

And then there's some winnowing. At least this has been my experience-probably other people have a different experience-but some people stop doing it and do something else. Which is cool. Some people get very busy, or you lose touch with them. And then a lot of people have jobs and lives that-you know, they're already reading their students work, and trying to make a living, and trying to keep their life together, and do their own work.
