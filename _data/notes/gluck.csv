Reading poems backwards divorces editorial attention from meaning and refocuses it toward syntax and mechanics. ,revision,"[reading mss backwards] Oh yeah. I still do that. It's horrible, and you need someone to help you. Your eye makes substitutions, so unless you read it out of order&#8212;i.e. backwards&#8212;you're going to be doing that."
Teaching is an integral source of inspiration—and a way out of writer's block.,teaching,"The minute I started teaching, I started writing again. I still feel about teaching that it's the most miraculous thing I've ever discovered, because I can't always write, and long periods go by and I don't write. But I can always teach, and I will always meet people who fascinate me and who are doing things, who have minds that go places my mind has never gone. "
Entire manuscripts are sometimes revised at the line level due to the late addition of a single poem or other new element. ,mss;revision,"Yeah, and then sometimes there will be a massive revision.

"Feedback is important, but from whom it is requested varies in accordance with the particular poem or project. ",correspondence,"They change. I mean, it's certain periods, certain people. Sometimes, you'll feel these poems&#8212;if they're ever going to be understood by anyone&#8212;will be understood by X. And you're usually right&#8212;when X says, ""This won't do,"" you trust it, because the person is basically on the side of the work."
