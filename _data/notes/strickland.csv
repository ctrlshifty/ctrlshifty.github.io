"books have much more staying power; digital/online poetry productions very hard to capture/record, like a theatre performance --> once it's done it's done",printdig,"But I would never not want books. You could see that. The minute you start to do digital work, there's a certain way—in the same way that, if you're a theater person—that you have to let something go. Even more than you let a manuscript go. Today's performance was today's performance, and that won't come back. Even if you videotaped it, it really doesn't come back."
Paper enables better long form argument,printdig; paper,"Well, if you're writing something long with a complex argument, I think it's much easier to read and have it in front of you on paper and read it out"
"writing poetry on paper provides enormous freedom, when compared to digital forms",printdig; paper,"it's not fluid enough to do poetry. I mean, it restricts you way too much in terms of formatting compared to what you can do on a page by hand in terms of how you want to scratch things out or put something right in—"
"hyper aware of changes in software and, due to one particularly bad experience, threat of data loss due to software glitches",between;paper,
writes back into notebooks to generate work by seeing whether an image or idea is still arresting,between;paper,"Because I want to go back and see is there—does it still have the pull for me that it did, the things that I wrote down at that time, because there are things that tend to be continually magnetizing for me."
technology/software evidenced via usage characteristics as well as characteristic mistakes made,early,"So each technology actually gave rise to a certain kind of poetry and a certain kind of mystique. people making email or characteristic word substitutions that you do that you never did on the page—anyway, so I don't think that story has really been told because it shifts so rapidly, because you went from email to texting, to this to that, you know, and each one of those things has a different"
"used to rent a computer when going to residencies, mostly for printout",early,"I would rent a computer to have at that place because I wanted the print out, and I still want the print out."
"with digital work, there's no straight path (as opposed to print); sometimes Strickland provides path through",printdig;paper;mss,"that's for print because then in a digital work, there's not an ""in"" in the same way, right? In other words, there's an access often to all parts of it at once, you know in some kinds though I generally provide a default path through as well as more open thing."
will revise within file with date and version listed; mss will get new files,files;mss,
IBM Selectric introduced erasing --> big deal but also required discipline,change; early,"I need those little balls on the IBM Selectric. That was like this huge thing that you could erase with an erase thing, that you don't have to pull the page out and start all over again. On the other hand, there was a discipline about that. "
design intelligence lost due to changing technology; much explored disappeared already,future;software;change,"I understand Flash is a memory hog and all that when we moved to&#8212; but between those two things, those were very creative things, you know, and they haven't been really replaced. The HTML 5 and JavaScript doesn't do it the same way. I mean, people are trying to do it, so the thing is, they'll make an app. So, yeah&#8212;that whole thing just annoys me, that it's under the control of so few software, I mean, so few computer or software companies, you know, what you can do or what's supposed to be done and the way things are supposed to look. It was such an open&#8212;so much to explore and so much did get explored and has disappeared because of the inability to access it."
"stuck with digital projects/eliterature due to inherent possibilities and international aspect, the latter Strickland connects with the importance of global communication generally",software;prompt;,"the possibilities are just so great with respect to time and performativity and— —reach, and it's an international art form, the last of which was maybe concrete poetry. You know? We need to communicate. The world's problems are global, whether climatologic or poverty or what have you, right? Water, whatever; resources, survival. So, you need to speak—you know, I can't speak to 500 people, you know what I mean?"
"eliterature is hard to get, and so both worlds tend to be exclusive",software,"And I'm pretty much really deeply in both worlds, and they just don't get it. I mean they don't get each other and it's very hard with e-literature because it changes so much that unless you're deeply in it, it's hard to learn it."
nature of eliterature work requires collaboration and is bracketed by limited amount of time,software;prompt;,"And so, it's how much can you get done in the time, and you hope to God that you think of the right thing at the moment that the person is able to implement it, and that you have this whole other thing that's really important to do, skip your mind or whatever"
often has a vision of her projects but technology often not available to make happen; product is a negotiation ,software;prompt;,"So, I usually have a vision, just like with True North. It's a vision that's impossible, short of an installation"
"very non-traditional career both in medium and in practice, with struggles often to find time due to family and work committments",career,
"collaboration, friendship paramount to her career and working methods",career,
no clue how to best preserve elit projects but believes video might be efficient,future;software;change," I think that the best way probably at the moment to save digital stuff is to have some video or something of somebody using it, plus people's notes, interview them about what they intended or whatever, save the code if you can, and adding emulation migration. All of it is so burdensome, you know? I"
believes books and notebooks sufficient for archive; no need to save whole histories of revisions,future,
