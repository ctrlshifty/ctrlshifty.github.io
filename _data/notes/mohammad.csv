"Prior to the advent of the internet, finding venues for the language poetry that would later become integral to his style was difficult. ",early;career,I think I was really just kind of feeling around in the dark.
"Paper is rarely, if ever, used in the composition process, though very early drafts are saved (and hidden away).",paper,I think the only exception to that is maybe I have some paper copies somewhere of something I wrote in college and hope no one ever sees
"Though composition, revision, and manuscript assembly happens almost exclusively in a digital environment, the actual files aren't necessarily cared for as one might think. Could this be because Mohammad's was a writing practice born in a digital environment, where he feels more ""at home,"" less anxious, than others?",files,"Oh, no. I don't. I probably should, but I almost never save drafts. I just open up a doc and write over it until I think it's finished."
"Three distinct stages frame the evolution of writing practice: 1) exchanges of language experiments with other poets via a low-pressure email group, 2) ""Google collage""-making (using search results), and 3) experiments with rearranging Shakespearean sonnetts (""Sonograms"").  ",change;between;career;correspondence,"it's kind of, at least so far, been kind of a really distinct, three-stage process."
Composition almost resembles a kind of digital painting—moving copy and pasted words and phrases around on the screen until the desired effect is achieved.,prompt;revision;flarf,There was something kind of pleasing about pulling the components around and almost physically moving them around in that digital space.
"Basic—and often purposefully absurd—search terms serve as a starting point, and often evolve into a kind of unifying theme across a manuscript. ",prompt;mss,"my first book Deer Head Nation involved a bunch of searches that usually included, among other terms, the term ""deer head."""
"After a period of pushing found excerpts around into interesting arrangements, the least interesting language is stripped away.",revision;flarf,"it would be like refrigerator magnets, though sometimes with full phrases instead of just individual words. And in the middle of that process, I'd usually get rid of most of the language—some of the language I couldn't figure out what interesting things I could do with, or that wouldn't be interesting."
Finding unusual and pleasant combinations of the language itself takes precedence over finding or constructing new meaning.,revision;prompt,"You know, it didn't matter what it ""said"" in the traditional sense. I was interested in, like, ""Wow! How can you put those words in that place!"""
"Much like the poems themselves, manuscripts as a whole are most often organized in terms of energies existing at the language level rather than a thematic one. ",mss;flarf,"Really, the only one that's thematically organized in any sense is the first one."
"Aside from a physical collection of print journals containing past work, ongoing projects and more recent publications are saved digitally, and only occassionally backed up.",future,"Yeah, I've gotten kind of lax on it. I need to go in and update it, but typically what it'll be is: I have a folder—a main poetry folder—and within that, if there is a specific categories for certain projects, I'll divide them in to that, like a book project or whatever."
Blogging and other online forums have—outside of initial Flarf exchanges—been used mostly as a casual social connection with other poets.,correspondence;flarf,"I think for me, again, the main value of the blogging thing was to bring me in to contact with other poets and having discussions."
"At a certain point, the Flarf movement began to dismantle itself, as central figures began expanding upon initial Flarf ideas and motivations (like the ""sonograms"").",flarf,"I think ""Death of Flarf,"" most of the time, was a phrase we used ourselves just to kind of, like, kill the beast before it killed us, or something. But I think it just ran its course."
"""Flarf"" is the term used to describe a recent movement in language poetry that used text found online to construct poems, and originated on a small, extremely casual email listserv.",flarf,"There was almost nothing critical going on in there, ever."
