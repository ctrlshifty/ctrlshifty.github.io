"Writing process stayed the same until final book, so until about 2010 or so",early;prompt; between;paper,The process through all of the books until this most recent one was all long-hand and then typewriter
"moving from long-hand to typewriter was a producitve and often pleasurable break/move that he repeated over and over to write his books, even on long sections",between;paper;revision,"There's 16 sections of it of varying lengths, and I'd do it section by section. It was pretty much chronological, but some of the sections were 16, 17 pages long, so I'd go through the whole process for that particular section. You know, if I were typing up what I'd recently added 4 or 5 lines to, I'd probably type the whole thing again"
"With last book, found he didn't miss the typing stage and that the notetaking, typing, and revision stages all started to meld",change; between,"There was, as I said before, a surprise that I wasn't at all missing the typing—the typing stage probably because it was all typing. So, it was as if... That's what's happened with this machine—was the long-hand and the typing just coalesced and because the same activity."
"reading and notetaking central to process from beginning, moving from 5x8 cards to notebooks, increasing in importance over years",paper; prompt,I think the reading and the note-taking part of it has gotten to be more dominant over the course of the time
"highly idiosyncratic note-taking technique, with mutli-colored references and interpretations of previous notes",paper; prompt,"these are the notes that I would take for the book that I'm reading. The RED is the more important material. It's something that, if I'm going through it I can read and just pick out the highlighted parts, then GREEN are my own responses. So, I'm always working on the right hand page when I'm taking notes from books I'm reading, then when I'm going back over the material, I'll work on this page and there'll be other changes. Usually more GREEN will turn up."
"Doesn't write drafts; instead writes whole book poem by poem line by line; mss just one file with most recent additions, written poem by poem, line by line",files; mss;revision,I work on them almost only cumulatively so that I take them along line by line. I don't...I'm not able to write a draft of something.
Major changes in writing practice more due to realization of content and improvement of practice/standards rather than technology,change,"After I wrote the Vegetables, I had a standard that I had to apply all the time. And once it was in place, then I had something to work with besides form (I had form, too, but I had form before when I was filling form with bad phrases)."
"loves non-invasive quality of computer, especially for corresopndence",correspondence; ,"But I love how non-invasive this [the computer] is as a medium—not so much in terms of my being protected against being invaded by somebody else, but being able to say something (send somebody something here [on the computer]) and understand that they can open it when they want, and that it's not an imposition on them."
"music, starting with jazz then moving to rock and roll, and finally staying with classical, had a profound effect on practice, especially on form and length of individual poems ",change; revision,"I think there's a non-accidental relationship between the forms I was working with having been as short as a 3-minute take and a sonata form, or a scherzo trio form, or an adagio, or something like that that the lengths of it (the units I was working on ) got larger when I was listening to pieces of music that were 8-9 minutes to ½ an hour long."
"has sense of what's missing in current manuscript and writes toward that, save for, of course, first poem",prompt;mss,"I'm focused on one, but I have a pretty good sense of where it might go, organizationally, in relation to the others except right at the beginning of the project. At that point, I'm not clear on what's missing. I'm working toward beginning to understand what the whole might contain,"
reading and engagement with other authors key to both generating and revising work,prompt;revision,"And then that gives me a sense that there's less I've failed to address, and therefore maybe I've been brought to a position (with their help) of being able to find a phrase that lets me move from this point, in where I am with the poem I'm writing, further along."
"the product of all the work is the poem that can't be made better, which is contained in a book",revision,The poem that I can't make any better
mcmichael's career dotted by periods of not-writing too,career;prompt,"I don't understand why I didn't just accept that I was thru writing. I mean, that should have been enough, but that wasn't what I felt –I don't know why, but I didn't."
"has never regretted getting rid of lines, etc.",future;revision,I didn't ever regret throwing stuff away.
