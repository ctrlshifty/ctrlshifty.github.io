"The internet facilitates leaps in thought, association, and poetic imagination.",change,"Computers and internet have influenced the content of my poems a lot, doing a lot with websites, with that kind of radical interconnectivity of associative thinking that the internet suggests. I think that the dawn of the internet probably has changed the way I compose my poetics in certain way, and that it has given permission for more associative, mimetic thinking process that I associate with internet links."
"How the internet ""thinks"" in relation to poetic composition.",change,"And that, I think, was one of the first poems where I consciously wrote a poem whose thinking was related to the way I think the internet thinks&#8212;if we can call the internet a ""thinker."""
Ongoing value of paper processes.,paper;change;between,There is something about writing out the sections of a poem on a card and then moving them around that I find more satisfying even than doing it on the computer.
Contemporary practice involves a necessary back & forth between paper and screen. ,prompt;paper;printdig;between,"I can write individual lines by hand. When it comes to a whole poem, I do it almost exclusively on the computer. This one says, ""Even the evenings are odd, even the odds are even/ offspring, autumnal, equinox, off kilter,"" which are not lines I ended up using but often, when I'm doing this kind of walking, I'll end up with a stack this big of note cards, and then when I'm at the computer, I shift them around and type them up, and rearrange them and shuffle them and move them into different places."
"If stray words and lines are generative ""rolls of the dice,"" digital composition ""deals a hand"" (for more on this & related processes, see ""Bruce Beasley's Prompt Generator"").",prompt;paper;printdig;between,"I'm a big fan of craps and gambling, and I like to think of words as, like, ""rolls of the dice,"" in a way. So often when I'm beginning a poem, I'll start with the straight lines and images, or phrases, quotations&#8212;like this&#8212;and then when I'm sitting down with a computer, I'll deal them out with something like&#8212;""You're in geometry."""
"Archiving involves a yearly retrospective of digital files, and the chance to revisit both stray lines and process notes. ",paper;future;between,"The other thing I do&#8212;you might be interested in&#8212;is once a year I print out all the notes, all the computer writing I've done. I keep them in a bound journal that is by year. So this one, for example, is 1999&#8212;and you'll see that a lot of times, when I work on the computer, I'll write a kind of journal, just sort of what's going on and what I'm thinking about, and working with stray pieces of poems that I've written down by hand."
"Tecnology has had less influence on composition process, and more on the ways poems take physical shape. ",early,So just doing essentially what I do now&#8212;large chunks of prose that would lead to ideas and sort of mull through ideas&#8212;but I was typing it on a Selectric typewriter.
"If the internet facilitates a leaping quality of thought, walking and ""flipping"" offer complementary rhythm.",prompt;revision,"There is something about the action, repetitive action of throwing and catching, that's always been really important to generating ideas. It's similar to the kind of rhythm I have when I'm walking, I think&#8212;that kind of rhythmic catch and release. So often when I'm writing, all through my life, I have kept this thing with me and I flip it while I'm thinking. Often, I can't think unless I'm doing that. It's a kind of kinetic thing, I think, and when I'm walking, often I have a stick, a stick that I'm flipping or throwing around, too."
Transitions from screen to page become an exercise in fruitful disorder. ,printdig;prompt;revision,"I just let lines accumulate, images accumulate, phrases&#8212;until I have a whole series of pages of drafts. Then I'll start worrying about it. I try not to make myself&#8212;I know poets who write from the first line on: begin with the first line and then write the second one. Linda Bierds once told me she writes that way, which astonished me because it's so utterly unlike anything I do. But I really try, especially when I write long poems&#8212;which a lot of my poems are&#8212;not to impose any order on it until I've got pages and pages of lines. Then I'll print them out."
Files organization goes hand in hand with revision process. ,files;revision,"You'll see I have a whole bunch of lines that I'm working on, and what I often do is just copy those, and write some prose about them&#8212;sort of identifying what I like about it and what's bugging me about it, what I don't like about it&#8212;and then paste it back again, move things around. Often, I'll put bold face when this is a revision process, when I get to a place that I don't like or feels clunky, I'll bold face it so that I can come back to it and just say, ""What am I going to do to fix that?"""
Spare time on the job as key to first-book drafting. ,career,"There was an old, famous ad campaign for Maytag washing machines, and the joke of it was that the washing machine never broke down; so they had Maytag Repairs, and the Maytag Repairs people were just really bored, they had nothing to do. So, I had a sign on my desk that said Maytag Repairs. But I had a lot of spare time, so I would write a lot at work on my typewriter&#8212;this was before computers. So, I wrote a lot of my first book in those jobs."
Revision as a means to heighten the evolving logic of the manuscript.,mss,I revise my poems to help them illustrate the structure of the book.
Same writing group for sharing work from pre- to post-email era.,correspondence,"Mostly. Some of them&#8212;two or three of them are people I went to graduate school with at Virginia. We had a writing group where we all met once a week while we were at grad school, and we've sort of continued over the years through the internet."
