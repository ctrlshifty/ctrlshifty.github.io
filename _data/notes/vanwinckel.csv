"Drafts every project by hand, in a separate notebook/space. ",paper;prompt,"I work in longhand, on yellow legal tablets, or just whatever. I have different notebooks that I have. That's what all these notebooks are here; these are my various writing projects in process. They each get their own little notebook."
Cleans up digital archives as each project is published. ,future;files,"Yeah, I save them as Word docs and then when I'm done with them and the books are published, then I just put them on a back-up disk and take them off my hard drive here."
"Lifiting spacial limitations re: which poem(s) start on which pages creates opportunity for new poem ideas via association, juxtaposition. ",paper;revision;change,"So yeah, early on - one of the things that's different now- is that early on I would probably just work on ""a"" poem, so I would write. I would have a page in my notebook, and there were lines, and I would move things around on the page, and then I would have another page in the notebook with a different poem. But over the years I've started working on maybe two or three poems almost kind of simultaneously, on the same page, which feels kind of nutty, but what I was experiencing that led me this way was that a lot of times things would be coming to me - images, lines --- that didn't seem to belong to the poem I thought I was working on. So I realize it might be helpful to not confine myself. So that's why that was one of the main transitions. I think that happened maybe half-way along. In the late-eighties or so I started experimenting with that and I liked it. I liked having just a page with a poem one margin, and another going down another margin, and one going across the bottom. Something like that."
"Same-page drafting segues into poem series', informs manuscript structure. ",change;mss,And then I liked that. I like working in series so much when I was writing that book that I also just decided I wanted to keep moving in that direction. I liked those series poems. And they maybe lent themselves more to that practice with several poems happening at the same time in early draft stages.
"Immersion-style writing process--by hand, or in her head--for stories versus poems. ",paper;prompt,"So much is going on. I go out and I take a walk every afternoon in this park. It's actually part of my writing process. I take a walk in the afternoon, and it's like 'shut up' I'm just trying to take a walk!' People are talking in my head. It feels like this overpowering thing when I'm working on a story. It just comes over me and wakes me up in the morning. People wake me up in the morning. They are chattering away. It's very unnerving. I often push back at a story until I am really sure that I have quite a few of the building blocks in place. Because otherwise it just seems like a struggle and a fight. And it's going to occupy - it takes me like 10 ten-hour days in a row for a story."
Teaching inspired initial foray into fiction. ,career;teaching,"So, I think I just accidentally taught myself to write fiction by trying to help my students make their stories better and trying to diagnose: 'What does this story need?'"
Necessity of teaching fiction as a poet inspires unexpected bank of story ideas.,career;teaching;prompt;early,"I remember so many days walking to my fiction writing class and trying to think about what I was going to say to this writer about her story-how to address its troubles-and I realized that I was internalizing all of this. And then the first time I got a sabbatical, I remember I was driving into Chicago for a little adventure for the day (and I was so happy I had this sabbatical I was going to work on poems, of course) and I got this idea for a story. I remember I was just writing on my car seat while I'm driving-just this little note to myself about what the story-kind of just a synopsis, like one sentence of what it would be. By the time I got in to Chicago, I had 5 story synopses written on this piece of paper, and then I just came home. That's what I did for my whole sabbatical-I wrote a bunch of stories and that was the 1st book of stories. Limited Lifetime Warranty, it was called."
Tiered system of older > newer drafts stored in notebooks prior to digital trancription. ,between;revision;paper,"So, I probably&#8230; as I said, I probably do 2 or 3 handwritten drafts and I'll actually rip the notebook page out. I have notebooks and notebooks where I have a big X through the page so that I do not get confused that I'm actually done with this version, and now if I look hard enough in the notebook, there is a later version of these poems. But I throw the old, ripped up pages in the back of the notebook, and there's a newer version somewhere in there. But the older ones are fatter and often&#8230; I'm also experimenting with line break, then too, with the shaping issues&#8230;"
"Visually (and maybe generationally?), she experiences a heightened sense of permanence typing lines on the computer vs. experimenting with lineation by hand.",revision;between;printdig,"And then I feel like when I move it to the computer, I'm sort of getting to a place where I want to look at it&#8230; There's something that&#8230; I'm sure you're going to hear this with lots of writers my age&#8230; that there's something about when you type it up that starts to make it look permanent, especially for me in terms of the shape of the poem, the line links especially in a poem. I'm less inclined to fiddle with line links once I've got it on the computer. I do that. For some reason it still feels easier for me to do it on the page because like I just stick my slashes in there."
Computer serves as a bridge between paper drafts and submission/correspondence. ,between;revision;correspondence,"I'll look at it on&#8230; I'll come back to it over a period of a couple of weeks on the computer then (once it's on the computer file) and look at it, probably tinker with it a little bit more before, and then I'll start sending it out probably."
"Digital composition now happens ""in the moment,"" not just via transcription or revision.",career;change;between,"Well, I think it's mostly been gradual. I've grown more comfortable doing some revision work on the computer and especially with the fiction, and maybe because fiction still feels like a newer form to me. One shift that has felt a little bit more dramatic with composing is that I have found myself, when I'm working on short stories, actually doing some new composing work right here while I'm sitting. Like I'll be working on a story thinking&#8230; I'm typing in from my notebook&#8230;"
"On picking and choosing her own work for a hybrid approach to ""selected poems."" ",change;between;mss;revision,"And, you know, I feel like I'm kind of talking&#8230; I had&#8230; I sense one of the things that's going on in this project is that I'm talking back to history in a way and saying, 'No, that's not right,' and I like that. I like that versus-"
"Attached to the hand-eye coordination, tactile effect of drafting on paper.",paper,"And I still feel that when I'm working, especially on poems, that there's something happening between the eye and the fingers and the page. It's very tactile that I'm hanging on to that, which I like."
