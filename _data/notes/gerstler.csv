"She's focused on the low-tech, tactile facets of textual production and revision--how these influenced the making and copying of text--before transitioning to the computer. ",early;paper;between,"Well, this now gets to era and what generation I am, because I'm 57, so when I started writing it was typewriters, you know? I took a typewriter to college and it moved from-you know, I took typing in high school-and it went kind of quickly during my little time capsule of when I was sort of coming up. From portable typewriters and little cute cases that were sort of like a big lunch box with a little handle, to increasingly kind of complicated electric typewriters. With all their weird accoutrements like carbon paper and white out, or weird-they started making typewriters that actually had a correcting tape in them. It was like white and you would type over the letter that you wanted to correct with this white, chalky strip that was in there as part of the typewriter. Before you had to like shove a weird little piece. So, all these kind of very low-tech-viewed in hindsight-ways of dealing with making texts, correcting texts, revising texts, and also copying text. And then to the first sort of big-I remember when, you know, I first got a computer. It was sort of like, you know, I was ZZ Top. I had a tall music system here-it was this big, bulky thing, and there were things that went under the desk. And the printer had like-the print was really ugly looking."
Tension between an allegiance to paper drafting and the insubstantial nature of typing paper--how this fragility almost seemed to impact the poems themselves. ,early;paper;between;revision,"When I started writing poems when I was a kid-before I had access to a typewriter or learned to type-it was, you know, spiral-bound, lined notebooks. And then it kind of moved to typing things, which you'd think would have made me revise a lot, and I did revise, but I love computers. Every time you wanted to change a period, or move texts around, you had to retype everything. And you were sometimes dealing with these crappy kinds of paper like that onion skin-it was erasable, but it was so like thin and fragile and weird-looking, and tactilely bizarre, and kind of see-through-y. And made the poems seem like they were really not substantial. Smeared easily."
"Compared to typing, digital revision allows for quicker, more streamlined experimentation with form, lineation, and shape.",between;revision;change,"What I like is I can take a chunk of text and move it up here and it doesn't take me 40 minutes to retype the whole damn thing. And if I don't like it, I can try it down here. And if I want to print out a copy of something as a prose poem, and a copy of it with some line breaks, and look at them next to each other, I can do that in a flash. All that? I couldn't be happier. Because then I'm spending my time reading and writing and revising, and not spending my time [makes typing sound]. ""Oh! Now I have to do the whole thing all over again!"""
"Like Beasely with the notecards, dice, and dictionary prompts, she returns to pre-digital card catalogs for the unexpected associations, juxtapositions, tangents. An aspect of research hard to replicate via the internet.",prompt;change,"Well, I get ideas for poems, and sometimes they're phrases or sort of topics, or weird feelings, or vocabularies, or I want to write a poem based on the initial sort of generative impulses-""Oh, this has to do with hurricanes and my mother-in-law."" You know what I mean? Or something like that. And I love research. Research is, to me, such a rich, poetic, amazing exploration, and is full of the unexpected. Like-this is another thing that relates to sort of digital stuff, at least in my mind-one of the only things I miss about pre-digital is card catalogs, because, thumbing through a card catalog, I would be taken on many more weird tributaries than I get doing a computer search in a library on whatever. You know, I'd be looking up the history of ferns or something, and I'd come across the history of shock treatment, and I'd be like, ""Oh, that's way more interesting than ferns. What do we got here?"" And then go find that book or something. So, that I kind of regret, the way computer indexes are set up. It's actually a little harder to find things, I think, on topic. But anyway-I'm talking about going off on tangents and research, and I just went off on a tangent."
Difference between lucky finds in journalistic reserach and the neceessity of stumbling upon new ideas for literary projects. ,prompt;change,"For poetic and literary kind of research, I definitely miss the kind of strolling through the card catalog and all the different little blooming subjects that you would come across. Although, occasionally, in doing any kind of research-even a very sort of scholarly or fact-based project-you would come across something useful but that wasn't something you were looking for specifically, something that you didn't know was going to be there. Whereas that would be serendipitous in a kind of journalistic- or factual-type research, and it would be totally the point in more poetic or literary research may be."
"Likens manuscript production process to interior design, awarness of shape and cover art as well as balance between darker and lighter subject matter. ",mss;change,"More or less. For me, if it's a book of poems, some books of poems are sort of like a scrapbook, or a portfolio, or something, and some of them are more thematic, or the book itself has some kind of looser type-in my case, it's usually loose-structure, or trajectory. And even the ones that are kind of a sampler, I spend a fair amount of time trying to figure out, ""What's the first poem? What's the last poem? What's the movement? How do they work together? How do some of the last lines of ones feed in to the title or the first line of the next one? What looks good next?"" In a way, it's sort of like, though it's not exactly like, interior decoration-you want it to flow, have ups and downs. With me, it's like, ""What's the mixture of dark and funny ones?"" I mean, you do mini version of that when you're reading, even. And then sometimes it's like, ""Oh, this is going to be in sections,"" and, ""Are these sections going to be numbered?"" It's basically manuscript construction, right? And if you're dealing with-I mean, I've been really lucky in being able to pick a verse because, you know, it's a funny thing with poems. It's like hardly anybody publishes poems anymore, and if you're lucky enough to get a book of poems published, usually they're not treating it like it's, you know the next big best-seller. They don't have a big investment in it. So, the fact that it's much less a big deal to them has its pros and its cons, but one of the pros is, usually, they're not going to impose a cover on me, because it's not like, ""Well, this is going to be a blockbuster, and therefore, we need to have this kind of cover."" So, I get to pick covers by artists that I like usually. So, thinking about that, and how the title-the overall title of the book-where that's going to come from."
"Anticipating use of something like InDesign for greater flexibility when it comes to digital manipulation and shaping of text, layouts. ",mss;change;software,"In the dark ages with, you know, lint and dog hair and crumbs. But I'm sure at this point there are multiple programs-there must be-that if I knew how to use them, I could pull the thing together and look at it on a grid, or two grids-something like that. Or scan things in."
"File titles as shorthand for easy poem recognition, as opposed to the finished poem title itself --> emphasis on findability via subject versus date.",files,"The names change, because I was so happy when I realized that you could change the names. Because I start out&#8212;and this is more true of poems than anything else&#8212;but sometimes I'll start out calling something, you know, ""Ostrich Parade,"" or something, and then by the time I get to the fifth draft, there are no ostriches in it anymore, and I'm going to remember something else in order to be able to find it quickly. So, I will change the name."
Email and digital editing tools changed the nature of both journalistic revision/correspondence and ability to maintain aeshtetic intentions with poetry submissions. ,change;between;revision;correspondence,"Yeah, like almost the whole time that I worked at Art Forum, it was like-well, at the beginning-it was like over the phone, you know, ""Blah, blah, blah."" And then it would be like somebody would mark something up and send it to you over email, and then you'd go argue with them over the phone. But you wouldn't be sitting there over the phone going, ""OK, in paragraph 3, about the middle, this sentence, this word""-you know what I mean? Again-making things much more efficient, speeding things up. And also, it was a lot about-for me, but I don't think I was alone in this-a lot about learning curve. Figuring out how to use the computer, and what you could do with it graphically, also, with poems. Because suddenly, you know, on a typewriter and on the early computers, you couldn't play with typeface, you couldn't play with type size. People who wanted to make concrete poetry or poetry that uses, you know-they really worked hard. You know, all those guys back in the day they worked hard to get that written and then made sure that it went in to print as the artistic, graphic, on-the-page creation that they wanted to make."
"Again with the pros and cons of tactile process--cutting and pasting by hand versus digital manipulation of the text. How this early process was fun, but also hard to render as a polished final draft. ",revision;early;paper;,"Kind of. And I actually-this is making me remember things-I did a lot of cutting with scissors and taping together with scotch tape. I did more and more and more of that. So, you can't believe how happy I was. And, you know, you'd lose pieces, or the wind would blow them, or the dog would eat them. You know what I mean? And then if you tried to Xerox something like that, they would have these big, gross lines, and it would just look like, ""Yay! We're in kindergarten!"""
"She saves the sharing of work with fellow writers for a limited number of correspondents, towards the end of the drafting process. ",correspondence;revision ,"Yeah, ""It's all about me today!"" You know. So, I have a few people I try not to tap very often, and much later in the process. And I try really hard to do it myself, and to come back to things multiple times from multiple angles. Because, you know, when you're younger, you have a lot more friends, and you're all young, and you have a little bit more time, and maybe people aren't locked in to jobs or families, and you're all artists and writers together coming up. And then there's some winnowing. At least this has been my experience-probably other people have a different experience-but some people stop doing it and do something else. Which is cool. Some people get very busy, or you lose touch with them. And then a lot of people have jobs and lives that-you know, they're already reading their students work, and trying to make a living, and trying to keep their life together, and do their own work. So, you know, you're like, ""Hey, here's sixty pages of my poem on top of your busy, multi-tasking life. Have fun!"""
Email and file storage/archives via Carbonite. ,correspondence;future,"Oh, yeah. Some emails I print out, and many I save by leaving them on the computer. And again, since the gods of Carbonites are supposedly looking out for me, it's saved there, too"
