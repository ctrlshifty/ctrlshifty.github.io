looks like paper to me yeah but I I

0:01:18.920,0:01:26.040
don't know but it was nice not to have

0:01:22.380,0:01:36.530
to ask an artist or an artist estate for

0:01:26.040,0:01:36.530

0:01:59.350,0:02:06.220
I mean it's whatever makes you leave

0:02:03.310,0:02:07.510
while you - oh no no no yeah just do

0:02:06.220,0:02:08.770
whatever you done just yeah and then

0:02:07.510,0:02:14.050
I'll give you a ring when we're not

0:02:08.770,0:02:16.450
finished okay so I know you're you know

0:02:14.050,0:02:18.690
you don't use a great amount of digital

0:02:16.450,0:02:21.490
devices as well you use one zero

0:02:18.690,0:02:23.770
well the iPad does that's very new

0:02:21.490,0:02:28.480
that's that's this last year okay

0:02:23.770,0:02:30.430
oh I I got it in a strange way and I

0:02:28.480,0:02:33.850
learned how to use it very very very

0:02:30.430,0:02:38.320
very slowly okay I've only been able to

0:02:33.850,0:02:41.890
use it for oh I don't even think a whole

0:02:38.320,0:02:44.890
year okay so yeah

0:02:41.890,0:02:49.590
so I all just so then in some ways this

0:02:44.890,0:02:53.530
might be really short movie but I'll ask

0:02:49.590,0:02:56.850
kind of is this a bad basically focused

0:02:53.530,0:02:59.350
on the use of digital equipment it is a

0:02:56.850,0:03:00.550
sort of that's what that's Mike that's

0:02:59.350,0:03:02.170
kind of my slant

0:03:00.550,0:03:05.170
I mean that's kind of like the way I got

0:03:02.170,0:03:06.580
money probably but it's but it's become

0:03:05.170,0:03:08.500
much more interest I've become more

0:03:06.580,0:03:10.810
interested in just sort of talking to

0:03:08.500,0:03:12.519
the artists and writers about the ways

0:03:10.810,0:03:14.049
that their processes have evolved and

0:03:12.519,0:03:15.700
how it's changed and so in some ways

0:03:14.049,0:03:17.620
that that's definitely doesn't it

0:03:15.700,0:03:19.209
doesn't matter device whatever you're

0:03:17.620,0:03:20.860
using it's just I just AM interested on

0:03:19.209,0:03:24.700
how that how your physical day-to-day

0:03:20.860,0:03:27.670
works and so while what these first

0:03:24.700,0:03:29.830
group of questions are really based on

0:03:27.670,0:03:31.690
digital stuff so just tell me to skip it

0:03:29.830,0:03:33.610
if he doesn't make sense to you but then

0:03:31.690,0:03:35.590
we'll talk more about sort of the

0:03:33.610,0:03:37.870
general arc of the career in some and

0:03:35.590,0:03:43.810
how those processes change and go back

0:03:37.870,0:03:46.120
and forth and so if you would state your

0:03:43.810,0:03:51.790
name and the location we're at for this

0:03:46.120,0:03:53.209
interview Louise Glick I think like is

0:03:51.790,0:03:55.760
spelt with you

0:03:53.209,0:03:58.760
and I know love and the names Hungarian

0:03:55.760,0:04:03.920
and we're in Cambridge Massachusetts

0:03:58.760,0:04:05.329
in my apartment okay and of course I

0:04:03.920,0:04:08.030
know the answers to many of these

0:04:05.329,0:04:17.320
questions but so what genre do you work

0:04:08.030,0:04:22.190
in poetry and I have written some essays

0:04:17.320,0:04:26.180
some forwards to books when I was

0:04:22.190,0:04:28.430
judging my first book price contests but

0:04:26.180,0:04:30.889
in me apologize yeah are you gonna

0:04:28.430,0:04:32.870
collect those essays yeah good good

0:04:30.889,0:04:34.310
those are so excellent because I you

0:04:32.870,0:04:37.039
worked really hard at them I don't work

0:04:34.310,0:04:40.009
I worked so hard and they ruined ten

0:04:37.039,0:04:46.780
summers I guess a lady's frantic with

0:04:40.009,0:04:49.970
anxiety the idea of trying to do serve a

0:04:46.780,0:04:50.990
new talent and to describe its

0:04:49.970,0:04:54.080
uniqueness

0:04:50.990,0:04:57.080
great great and you know it's a natural

0:04:54.080,0:05:00.080
offshoot of teaching which I've loved

0:04:57.080,0:05:02.210
for years and I I loved everything about

0:05:00.080,0:05:03.800
judging those contests and I loved

0:05:02.210,0:05:07.039
working with the poet's on their

0:05:03.800,0:05:11.960
manuscripts mm-hmm and in the early days

0:05:07.039,0:05:14.630
before you know press was convinced that

0:05:11.960,0:05:16.970
this was worthwhile I used to buy a

0:05:14.630,0:05:21.380
plane ticket for people so they could

0:05:16.970,0:05:24.620
come here and spend three days working

0:05:21.380,0:05:27.409
okay and then we would you know I would

0:05:24.620,0:05:29.659
make very detailed recommendations which

0:05:27.409,0:05:32.120
they were free to not take because the

0:05:29.659,0:05:35.419
book you're on on the other hand they

0:05:32.120,0:05:38.630
weren't free to change the books any

0:05:35.419,0:05:41.330
which way yeah because I could say this

0:05:38.630,0:05:43.830
is not the book I chose so they had they

0:05:41.330,0:05:47.330
they could stay exactly

0:05:43.830,0:05:54.870
we were or they could respond to

0:05:47.330,0:05:57.659
suggestions and mm-hm and work further

0:05:54.870,0:05:59.699
and many of them actually felt a great

0:05:57.659,0:06:01.590
need for that kind of work and they just

0:05:59.699,0:06:06.150
didn't have somebody who was willing to

0:06:01.590,0:06:08.520
take that kind of detailed yeah early

0:06:06.150,0:06:09.870
interest why I mean from what I'm

0:06:08.520,0:06:13.229
experiencing it doesn't seem to be a

0:06:09.870,0:06:15.720
very common thing for is the selector to

0:06:13.229,0:06:16.889
make a real interest after they choose

0:06:15.720,0:06:17.849
and then they're done and they get their

0:06:16.889,0:06:20.250
money in they're on their way I think

0:06:17.849,0:06:23.219
that's sort of how most of them feel and

0:06:20.250,0:06:25.259
yes that them also don't want this off

0:06:23.219,0:06:27.840
the point that you're no no no it's all

0:06:25.259,0:06:30.569
it's all one thing most of them don't

0:06:27.840,0:06:32.610
want to read a lot of books or some some

0:06:30.569,0:06:35.849
time in some contests they're not

0:06:32.610,0:06:39.210
permitted yeah they're sent ten

0:06:35.849,0:06:43.259
finalists right screened by you know it

0:06:39.210,0:06:47.129
varies yeah but if these manuscripts are

0:06:43.259,0:06:50.430
being screened by people whose aesthetic

0:06:47.129,0:06:52.800
judgment do you question you don't know

0:06:50.430,0:06:57.120
what you're getting Yeah right I asked

0:06:52.800,0:06:59.069
to see as many as possible and with the

0:06:57.120,0:07:01.229
understanding that nothing would be

0:06:59.069,0:07:03.719
thrown out and tell where it was chosen

0:07:01.229,0:07:05.279
because if I didn't find a winner and a

0:07:03.719,0:07:07.409
hundred manuscript so I'm just going to

0:07:05.279,0:07:10.710
see the next hundred great and that was

0:07:07.409,0:07:12.509
all that was all fun because you didn't

0:07:10.710,0:07:14.250
have to read each book here to

0:07:12.509,0:07:16.529
completion and you didn't have to write

0:07:14.250,0:07:19.500
a little paragraph evaluating it the way

0:07:16.529,0:07:21.659
you do for other kinds of things yeah

0:07:19.500,0:07:23.490
yeah if you didn't love it it was

0:07:21.659,0:07:26.490
unlikely you would choose it you know

0:07:23.490,0:07:29.580
put it in the unlikely pile right in my

0:07:26.490,0:07:33.659
living room was filled with piles you

0:07:29.580,0:07:34.460
know identifiable by me yeah and then at

0:07:33.659,0:07:36.860
the end I would

0:07:34.460,0:07:38.900
read through the piles to see whether

0:07:36.860,0:07:40.690
something got primo promoted or demoted

0:07:38.900,0:07:44.690
and mm-hmm

0:07:40.690,0:07:48.080
some years were thrilling I mean it was

0:07:44.690,0:07:50.750
too much stuff and in those years most

0:07:48.080,0:07:55.789
of the runners-up ended up winning some

0:07:50.750,0:07:57.229
other well later yeah prize oh okay

0:07:55.789,0:07:59.360
this island you would encourage them to

0:07:57.229,0:08:01.880
result yeah yeah some people would

0:07:59.360,0:08:04.460
submit like three or four times yeah oh

0:08:01.880,0:08:07.960
that's that's interesting I don't I want

0:08:04.460,0:08:11.090
to know who it is yeah that's all okay

0:08:07.960,0:08:14.000
the so what part what time of year were

0:08:11.090,0:08:17.509
usually doing that evaluation it worked

0:08:14.000,0:08:21.020
out very well because for a lot of that

0:08:17.509,0:08:24.560
time I was just working halftime mm-hm

0:08:21.020,0:08:26.570
and yell night in the spring semester

0:08:24.560,0:08:28.759
and I'll get the manuscripts in December

0:08:26.570,0:08:32.500
right after the semester ended mm-hmm

0:08:28.759,0:08:35.180
and sometimes it was a little bit of I I

0:08:32.500,0:08:40.339
tried to give myself a couple of weeks

0:08:35.180,0:08:44.540
of blank yeah and then the cartons would

0:08:40.339,0:08:52.600
start to come from the people who were

0:08:44.540,0:08:56.060
screaming and yell aloud the

0:08:52.600,0:08:58.700
appropriation of a mechanism that I had

0:08:56.060,0:09:03.290
picked up from Michael Collier when I

0:08:58.700,0:09:07.430
judged the bailiffs price that he was it

0:09:03.290,0:09:11.720
revised he had each poet who was judging

0:09:07.430,0:09:14.510
shoes younger poets to scream so I chose

0:09:11.720,0:09:16.370
ten poets and they got paid it pittance

0:09:14.510,0:09:18.890
boots when each of them were at a

0:09:16.370,0:09:22.940
hundred books in seventy 10 okay

0:09:18.890,0:09:25.010
and kept 90 yeah and that meant that I

0:09:22.940,0:09:28.339
had someone to talk to about each of

0:09:25.010,0:09:30.829
these manuscripts yeah and sometimes we

0:09:28.339,0:09:31.889
would talk before they even said things

0:09:30.829,0:09:35.790
and

0:09:31.889,0:09:36.809
say read me a few poems and say what do

0:09:35.790,0:09:42.829
you want to see this

0:09:36.809,0:09:46.230
yeah and I'm on the fence yeah and um I

0:09:42.829,0:09:48.269
had great people screaming for me and

0:09:46.230,0:09:54.660
they were people whose judgments I

0:09:48.269,0:09:57.600
trusted and who sent me very broadly

0:09:54.660,0:10:00.540
diverse manuscripts and one thing that I

0:09:57.600,0:10:03.660
wanted was a series in which the books

0:10:00.540,0:10:05.939
weren't a whole like yeah I not yeah

0:10:03.660,0:10:08.249
anyway so no they're different that was

0:10:05.939,0:10:10.529
great and then it what it meant that all

0:10:08.249,0:10:12.899
the prose writing I did for ten years

0:10:10.529,0:10:16.980
was writing forwards

0:10:12.899,0:10:21.839
mm-hmm and that's all I have a stack and

0:10:16.980,0:10:28.559
yeah I had a few other essays it doesn't

0:10:21.839,0:10:33.089
make as pleasing a collection as the

0:10:28.559,0:10:37.470
first one yeah but I can't stand the

0:10:33.089,0:10:41.629
idea that it's just don't know where no

0:10:37.470,0:10:41.629
I I will be very excited to have that oh

0:10:41.839,0:10:48.209
not three words not three words that's

0:10:45.509,0:10:48.509
not like proofs and theories oh this and

0:10:48.209,0:10:56.009
that

0:10:48.509,0:11:01.799
oh um no I don't either I want if I

0:10:56.009,0:11:04.619
think of okay is it coming out of this

0:11:01.799,0:11:06.899
FSG years yeah but not in another

0:11:04.619,0:11:11.339
no yeah I mean when I you've got this

0:11:06.899,0:11:21.959
next book yeah okay um well that was the

0:11:11.339,0:11:24.149
first question but uh I guess the other

0:11:21.959,0:11:26.519
I saw I went to a WPS year which was

0:11:24.149,0:11:30.809
terrifying I've never been yeah you

0:11:26.519,0:11:33.629
should never go but there was a there

0:11:30.809,0:11:36.740
was a panel with Richard Steichen oh

0:11:33.629,0:11:43.050
right and who were the other two

0:11:36.740,0:11:45.060
article and article ins and losing it

0:11:43.050,0:11:46.740
daddy to knows exactly and they were

0:11:45.060,0:11:48.810
talking I just I caught that second half

0:11:46.740,0:11:50.250
but I'd so I heard second talking about

0:11:48.810,0:11:51.870
this he's working with you on crash

0:11:50.250,0:11:53.819
which was really funny

0:11:51.870,0:11:55.199
he's funny I didn't know how funny he

0:11:53.819,0:12:04.939
was I didn't know you know I mean like

0:11:55.199,0:12:10.139

0:12:04.939,0:12:29.129
yeah oh really

0:12:10.139,0:12:31.319
I like that thank you yeah that's he

0:12:29.129,0:12:41.519
made these envelopes cuz he thought he

0:12:31.319,0:12:43.740
was gonna be living in Europe hmm and

0:12:41.519,0:12:48.000
then you know the message was the

0:12:43.740,0:12:54.470
envelope I didn't I don't know how you

0:12:48.000,0:12:59.449
can frame them because yeah I don't

0:12:54.470,0:12:59.449
they're very nice I think wonderful yeah

0:13:01.309,0:13:09.269
and he has another book coming out too

0:13:05.480,0:13:12.330
which I saw a long time ago I mean the

0:13:09.269,0:13:15.960
other Peter Peter strike us has a new

0:13:12.330,0:13:18.770
and oh it's wonderful

0:13:15.960,0:13:26.610
is it I really love his first book I

0:13:18.770,0:13:29.760
yeah and I I just think he's an

0:13:26.610,0:13:33.240
amazement mom and Jay Cutler has a new

0:13:29.760,0:13:37.290
book that he's peddling oh so those

0:13:33.240,0:13:39.120
first three I worked with really Luther

0:13:37.290,0:13:42.270
off really strong book closely on the

0:13:39.120,0:13:45.810
first books and with Peter and Jay I

0:13:42.270,0:13:51.000
worked a lot on the second two with

0:13:45.810,0:13:53.940
Richard much less he it's funny because

0:13:51.000,0:13:56.610
he needed a lot of editing his poems

0:13:53.940,0:13:58.650
were way too long yeah the stanzas were

0:13:56.610,0:14:03.240
too long the lines were too long but you

0:13:58.650,0:14:10.160
had to preserve that sense of an

0:14:03.240,0:14:13.770
avalanche sense that had long sense and

0:14:10.160,0:14:17.910
so it was very hard to figure out but

0:14:13.770,0:14:20.610
once he once he saw over a way of

0:14:17.910,0:14:22.320
approaching the language to edit it and

0:14:20.610,0:14:24.270
still give it mhm

0:14:22.320,0:14:26.310
still preserve his character he was he

0:14:24.270,0:14:29.820
was an excellent editor and he may feel

0:14:26.310,0:14:33.420
that he just knows how to do it yeah

0:14:29.820,0:14:38.430
humming sound yeah well I mean we talked

0:14:33.420,0:14:41.160
on the phone then yeah but I and I saw

0:14:38.430,0:14:43.800
early versions of a lot of poems yeah

0:14:41.160,0:14:47.040
well it crush has become sort of its own

0:14:43.800,0:14:48.900
mold oh yeah it really has it's been cut

0:14:47.040,0:14:53.010
it's it's interesting I mean I remember

0:14:48.900,0:14:54.960
I first heard about it at bread-loaf

0:14:53.010,0:14:57.750
that year I was there and somebody was

0:14:54.960,0:15:00.030
like have you read crush no spec oh like

0:14:57.750,0:15:01.770
I'm sorry nearly lost and then I taught

0:15:00.030,0:15:03.690
it and then I still have you know what

0:15:01.770,0:15:05.520
we know the MFA students kind of at

0:15:03.690,0:15:08.250
Idaho and there's some of them were

0:15:05.520,0:15:09.600
teaching it or like the guy I wanted my

0:15:08.250,0:15:12.540
the guy was actually working for me and

0:15:09.600,0:15:14.040
digital is they faced his final poem and

0:15:12.540,0:15:16.650
this beeps us off those lines and those

0:15:14.040,0:15:18.420
and that sort of stanza style so well a

0:15:16.650,0:15:21.150
lot of it is both sound like him you can

0:15:18.420,0:15:24.400
see they read the broken

0:15:21.150,0:15:29.880
yeah yeah that's the things your heart I

0:15:24.400,0:15:29.880
know but uh yeah

0:15:29.910,0:15:38.590
are you okay yeah yeah okay yeah then

0:15:36.940,0:15:43.830
you can tell me how ridiculous this

0:15:38.590,0:15:43.830
interview is later so your primary genre

0:15:47.280,0:15:54.100
and so your primary genre is poetry

0:15:49.960,0:15:57.660
correct yes so what kinds of devices do

0:15:54.100,0:16:00.370
you own or have access also or just you

0:15:57.660,0:16:04.570
what what kinds of devices do you have

0:16:00.370,0:16:06.700
access to or use for writing I have

0:16:04.570,0:16:11.100
access to an iPad I'd never written

0:16:06.700,0:16:14.650
anything on it except a terse email okay

0:16:11.100,0:16:17.380
and I can't bear reading poems in that

0:16:14.650,0:16:21.970
form and in fact today there was a

0:16:17.380,0:16:24.700
conversation with my publisher because

0:16:21.970,0:16:28.810
they finally figured out a way to their

0:16:24.700,0:16:34.180
satisfaction to convert their poetry

0:16:28.810,0:16:35.520
listings to ebooks mm-hmm and question

0:16:34.180,0:16:38.460
was do that what

0:16:35.520,0:16:39.780
my permission and I cannot bear reading

0:16:38.460,0:16:42.180
palms in that form

0:16:39.780,0:16:44.640
I mean scrolling down the page you have

0:16:42.180,0:16:47.070
no idea how long the thing is yeah you

0:16:44.640,0:16:57.270
don't know whether you're in the middle

0:16:47.070,0:17:01.140
or at the end and Miranda who was my you

0:16:57.270,0:17:04.200
know daily editor not my big guy yet

0:17:01.140,0:17:06.720
okay I who was the student of mine at

0:17:04.200,0:17:11.430
Yale no it's very funny oh I have all

0:17:06.720,0:17:13.440
these students down positions up I have

0:17:11.430,0:17:16.500
to take to say authority but I turned to

0:17:13.440,0:17:20.040
them for you know solace and advice all

0:17:16.500,0:17:23.700
the time right Miranda is quite great

0:17:20.040,0:17:29.090
and her judgment is wonderful and she

0:17:23.700,0:17:32.010
was a wonderful beginning writer too um

0:17:29.090,0:17:34.380
anyway she she said she thought it was a

0:17:32.010,0:17:37.200
good idea she said for people who are

0:17:34.380,0:17:41.610
used to reading in this form you know

0:17:37.200,0:17:44.580
it's not such a violation mm-hmm it

0:17:41.610,0:17:46.290
makes me uneasy so so if friends for

0:17:44.580,0:17:51.440
example when I was in Stanford and

0:17:46.290,0:17:57.500
friends would send me drafts of poems us

0:17:51.440,0:17:59.960
do yeah I do through the mail right or

0:17:57.500,0:18:02.900
at Stanford I would give something to a

0:17:59.960,0:18:09.679
secretary but you know there wasn't a

0:18:02.900,0:18:11.780
lot that's further up the pike I just

0:18:09.679,0:18:13.580
have to go to someone who can print it

0:18:11.780,0:18:15.320
you have to have it on paper yeah

0:18:13.580,0:18:18.169
and that's well I have to be able to

0:18:15.320,0:18:20.720
move my pen around and make notes first

0:18:18.169,0:18:25.220
of all yeah and I have to see what it

0:18:20.720,0:18:30.799
looks like what if what the duration is

0:18:25.220,0:18:34.760
what and I have to be able to read the

0:18:30.799,0:18:36.710
beginning in the end I have to have them

0:18:34.760,0:18:39.440
all in my head but mainly is that I

0:18:36.710,0:18:43.120
don't know how to make notes otherwise

0:18:39.440,0:18:45.799
so I have but I have this that gives me

0:18:43.120,0:18:50.740
fantastic pleasure in other ways I mean

0:18:45.799,0:18:56.120
I love it and it said an endless

0:18:50.740,0:18:59.450
amusement and I keep it very near my bed

0:18:56.120,0:19:01.309
or on my bed and if I wake in the middle

0:18:59.450,0:19:07.100
of the night I turn on the light and I

0:19:01.309,0:19:09.620
see if anybody's reading - I always have

0:19:07.100,0:19:12.559
that experience around the clock rate

0:19:09.620,0:19:15.380
except that I you know I I check it

0:19:12.559,0:19:18.580
every four minutes and I'm so

0:19:15.380,0:19:23.419
heartbroken when there's no change

0:19:18.580,0:19:26.360
same old email from Amazon or you know

0:19:23.419,0:19:30.669
even some some website that I patronized

0:19:26.360,0:19:33.660
once right and I have a regular

0:19:30.669,0:19:36.120
old-fashioned cell phone I only

0:19:33.660,0:19:40.110
about five years ago because I'm taxi

0:19:36.120,0:19:45.540
dependent I needed to be on the street

0:19:40.110,0:19:48.960
and calling the guy yeah so it doesn't

0:19:45.540,0:19:51.150
do it doesn't receive emails or so you

0:19:48.960,0:19:54.180
need please just and it's a regular iPad

0:19:51.150,0:20:10.040
just like a the first no or a larger one

0:19:54.180,0:20:10.040
or a smaller yeah okay okay

0:20:11.380,0:20:30.280
oh the stream yeah yeah yeah okay that's

0:20:28.390,0:20:31.960
the regular size they have the minis now

0:20:30.280,0:20:34.740
that's the only kind of different what

0:20:31.960,0:20:34.740
happened was

0:20:35.700,0:20:43.680
some of this has to be off the record

0:20:38.050,0:20:48.450
okay this event I was invited to just

0:20:43.680,0:20:52.330
think the golden plate award for

0:20:48.450,0:20:55.030
sponsored by held by something called

0:20:52.330,0:20:58.300
the Academy of achievement I mean it

0:20:55.030,0:21:00.460
sounds so spurious and ridiculous but

0:20:58.300,0:21:02.290
but to show you showed up and you got

0:21:00.460,0:21:05.260
ten thousand dollars and it was in

0:21:02.290,0:21:10.510
Washington DC and the hotel wasn't

0:21:05.260,0:21:15.760
honnestly swine no I mean super Swank so

0:21:10.510,0:21:18.400
I I asked my agent to find out what was

0:21:15.760,0:21:24.100
the fewest number of days I could go and

0:21:18.400,0:21:26.950
still collect the food and it was one so

0:21:24.100,0:21:29.470
I scaled it way back yeah that I found

0:21:26.950,0:21:34.840
that when I arrived that the dinner the

0:21:29.470,0:21:37.570
night before for the honorees had been

0:21:34.840,0:21:43.330
in the chambers of the Supreme Court

0:21:37.570,0:21:46.080
with the justices just just that just

0:21:43.330,0:21:49.960
the justices and the honorees yeah I

0:21:46.080,0:21:55.420
couldn't you could have eaten dinner

0:21:49.960,0:21:57.880
oh no so anyway when I arrived part of

0:21:55.420,0:22:01.480
my welcome package was this thing

0:21:57.880,0:22:05.140
and it was all programmed with the

0:22:01.480,0:22:09.400
winners okay and their BIOS yeah

0:22:05.140,0:22:11.440
and of the entertainment of the last

0:22:09.400,0:22:14.320
night when we all got our plates

0:22:11.440,0:22:19.650
you actually got gold plates yeah I mean

0:22:14.320,0:22:23.289
the room was it was a very very good for

0:22:19.650,0:22:26.500
banquet me oh yeah extraordinary in this

0:22:23.289,0:22:29.309
space I mean if you square it off this

0:22:26.500,0:22:32.260
room and then he's off the whole thing

0:22:29.309,0:22:33.880
it certainly wasn't bigger yeah there

0:22:32.260,0:22:38.520
might have been a little smaller when I

0:22:33.880,0:22:38.520
saw the picture an intimate space I

0:22:40.530,0:22:45.490
always want people to guess but it's

0:22:42.880,0:22:47.860
ridiculous what are they gonna guess it

0:22:45.490,0:22:50.320
was like seeing Mozart it was a wreath

0:22:47.860,0:22:55.360
of Franklin oh my gosh really

0:22:50.320,0:23:01.870
retha yeah she was there right where the

0:22:55.360,0:23:04.059
tulips are bow yeah different color so

0:23:01.870,0:23:06.190
that the whole thing was eerie

0:23:04.059,0:23:07.929
anyway the guy gave you gave me this one

0:23:06.190,0:23:09.669
I arrived I said don't give me this I'm

0:23:07.929,0:23:11.860
never gonna use it get rid of someone

0:23:09.669,0:23:13.960
who can make use of it great he said I

0:23:11.860,0:23:16.870
have to give it to you and I said but I

0:23:13.960,0:23:20.470
I won't use it I don't want it I'll

0:23:16.870,0:23:21.460
leave it in the hotel room please give

0:23:20.470,0:23:25.240
it to someone else

0:23:21.460,0:23:27.520
mm-hmm and he said I have to give it to

0:23:25.240,0:23:30.400
you and he thrust it at me and then I

0:23:27.520,0:23:32.049
was holding it then I seemed to have it

0:23:30.400,0:23:34.870
so I took it to the hotel room and I'd

0:23:32.049,0:23:37.920
seen that people push the screen so I

0:23:34.870,0:23:40.080
pushed the screen yeah nothing happened

0:23:37.920,0:23:42.840
I mean it wasn't connected to anything

0:23:40.080,0:23:49.440
but and I thought well I apparently

0:23:42.840,0:23:53.340
don't have the gift so I I then brought

0:23:49.440,0:23:56.730
it home well actually I had somebody

0:23:53.340,0:24:01.410
ship it to me uh-huh and then I kept

0:23:56.730,0:24:04.200
looking at it and thinking I guess now

0:24:01.410,0:24:07.650
that I own this I should learn how to

0:24:04.200,0:24:12.780
use it but I I lingered in that state

0:24:07.650,0:24:18.690
for about six months and then at some

0:24:12.780,0:24:22.110
point I asked one of my former students

0:24:18.690,0:24:24.210
from Billings Indiana like yeah don't

0:24:22.110,0:24:26.340
touch with the Yale students sometimes

0:24:24.210,0:24:31.890
come up here to work on their stuff

0:24:26.340,0:24:35.490
mm-hmm and one did and I said what do I

0:24:31.890,0:24:38.960
have to do to learn how to use this yeah

0:24:35.490,0:24:43.410
and he said well you need to get Wi-Fi

0:24:38.960,0:24:46.770
and I said how do I do that

0:24:43.410,0:24:49.140
do I call a TM table I called Comcast he

0:24:46.770,0:24:51.480
said call Comcast so I called Comcast

0:24:49.140,0:24:54.150
and they asked me questions I couldn't

0:24:51.480,0:24:58.680
answer yeah do you have a blank do you

0:24:54.150,0:25:01.590
blank blank and I said I know nothing

0:24:58.680,0:25:04.590
you have to just assume I have nothing

0:25:01.590,0:25:06.990
yeah but he I I thought this is not

0:25:04.590,0:25:08.850
gonna work it wasn't working so I called

0:25:06.990,0:25:11.430
the student back and I said write me a

0:25:08.850,0:25:14.610
script here's the kinds of thing

0:25:11.430,0:25:18.480
I was asked ya tell me what I say right

0:25:14.610,0:25:20.700
so I went back and I recited in my

0:25:18.480,0:25:25.050
script and someone came to the house and

0:25:20.700,0:25:26.940
installed a device mm-hmm and no one had

0:25:25.050,0:25:31.350
told me they had these little strobe

0:25:26.940,0:25:33.870
flickers and I'm epileptic right so I

0:25:31.350,0:25:40.200
thought oh this is never gonna do yeah

0:25:33.870,0:25:43.380
so I called the student again and he

0:25:40.200,0:25:45.930
said you can turn it around turn it some

0:25:43.380,0:25:54.930
strobe is facing another direction yeah

0:25:45.930,0:25:56.880
and I did and but then I still didn't

0:25:54.930,0:26:00.150
have an email account so then someone

0:25:56.880,0:26:03.750
else came up to work on poems and I got

0:26:00.150,0:26:05.820
an email then I was so horrified at this

0:26:03.750,0:26:07.680
transformation that I couldn't do

0:26:05.820,0:26:13.560
anything for it there for another six

0:26:07.680,0:26:17.580
months and then Robert Pinsky I told him

0:26:13.560,0:26:20.370
I had an email and he sent me a photo of

0:26:17.580,0:26:22.590
one of his grandchildren ah and I opened

0:26:20.370,0:26:29.900
this little thing and there was a photo

0:26:22.590,0:26:31.500
yeah and I got Wow and so I learned

0:26:29.900,0:26:34.890
certain skills

0:26:31.500,0:26:36.810
I still can't add an attachment uh-huh

0:26:34.890,0:26:41.130
no that's not what they're called

0:26:36.810,0:26:43.920
and oh okay yeah so somebody has to do

0:26:41.130,0:26:46.440
that when I need to know yeah yeah like

0:26:43.920,0:26:50.100
I wanted a HBO because I couldn't get

0:26:46.440,0:26:55.650
you to go yeah but then I have all of

0:26:50.100,0:26:58.080
these you know names passwords and I can

0:26:55.650,0:27:00.360
never remember what they are then they

0:26:58.080,0:27:03.570
asked me you know you said you want to

0:27:00.360,0:27:05.940
change your password yes and they asked

0:27:03.570,0:27:08.070
me my special secret question which

0:27:05.940,0:27:11.220
makes absolutely no sense what is your

0:27:08.070,0:27:15.630
favorite pet's name and I didn't have

0:27:11.220,0:27:21.000
pets I mean except when I was a child so

0:27:15.630,0:27:24.690
I yeah and they say well we can't change

0:27:21.000,0:27:25.470
the question because the the person who

0:27:24.690,0:27:28.860
this is

0:27:25.470,0:27:31.140
came up with this question and I think

0:27:28.860,0:27:33.740
you know that I never would have great

0:27:31.140,0:27:37.620
rady I still haven't figured that out

0:27:33.740,0:27:40.200
but now I try to write down the put a

0:27:37.620,0:27:42.980
password so you have some other place to

0:27:40.200,0:27:48.060
get it from in my phone book oh okay

0:27:42.980,0:27:50.430
because I think there's such a long list

0:27:48.060,0:27:53.460
in my head and I don't know which one is

0:27:50.430,0:27:55.740
for which great great so all that stuff

0:27:53.460,0:27:58.050
I hate yeah

0:27:55.740,0:27:59.850
no it's it's it's a it's such a daily

0:27:58.050,0:28:02.160
part of life now and we just we all

0:27:59.850,0:28:04.830
dislike it and when it's new to someone

0:28:02.160,0:28:08.130
it's also well kind of realize how awful

0:28:04.830,0:28:12.830
some of it is I like the adventure of

0:28:08.130,0:28:12.830
the nail and I

0:28:12.940,0:28:19.130
watching I've watched a lot of

0:28:16.370,0:28:21.770
television and when what I was I had

0:28:19.130,0:28:23.960
bronchitis this winter and so wonderful

0:28:21.770,0:28:25.670
because there it was in bed with me I

0:28:23.960,0:28:29.570
didn't have to go anywhere

0:28:25.670,0:28:31.310
yeah I didn't have to sit in a chair had

0:28:29.570,0:28:34.490
it all right there and you had endless

0:28:31.310,0:28:42.680

0:28:42.680,0:28:48.860
something I own em mmm you thought I

0:28:46.250,0:28:51.050
didn't want to wait for the lesson yeah

0:28:48.860,0:28:57.430
it's worth it those are pretty intense

0:28:51.050,0:29:00.770
and once dust ident this the real spine

0:28:57.430,0:29:01.970
thank you yeah I loved it I loved that

0:29:00.770,0:29:04.370

and we just finished that one oh yeah

0:29:04.370,0:29:12.290
not too long ago yeah yeah the what else

0:29:06.620,0:29:14.960
have you liked TV wives um whatever what

0:29:12.290,0:29:16.820

0:29:14.960,0:29:18.560
very good is it good yeah that's a very

0:29:16.820,0:29:20.570
good one have you seen Friday Night

0:29:18.560,0:29:22.010
Lights I've watched some of Friday Night

0:29:20.570,0:29:23.990
Lights machine you've never seen it

0:29:22.010,0:29:26.620
right now so we need to do the whole

0:29:23.990,0:29:30.980
thing yeah I did it several years ago

0:29:26.620,0:29:32.930
yeah I love that so I watch that at

0:29:30.980,0:29:35.750
Stanford this year and I thought it was

0:29:32.930,0:29:37.400
gonna take me there five seasons I

0:29:35.750,0:29:40.040
thought this is gonna last me the whole

0:29:37.400,0:29:43.190
my Stanford experience it's gonna be

0:29:40.040,0:29:46.370
great mm-hmm and I finished in about two

0:29:43.190,0:29:48.770
weeks but I didn't want to watch

0:29:46.370,0:29:51.650
anything else it's yeah

0:29:48.770,0:29:54.830
a marvelous book and there was something

0:29:51.650,0:29:57.590
about I mean I can record and watch

0:29:54.830,0:29:59.210
things on demand but yeah there was

0:29:57.590,0:30:01.730
something about the fact that I could do

0:29:59.210,0:30:04.040
this anywhere mm-hmm and if I went to a

0:30:01.730,0:30:05.510
hotel I could do it I still have it you

0:30:04.040,0:30:08.800
still do it you would you know it was

0:30:05.510,0:30:11.900
just I it was it was an amazing

0:30:08.800,0:30:14.150
discovery for me and I loved that show

0:30:11.900,0:30:17.420
and I ended up watching the last season

0:30:14.150,0:30:19.670
a second time and then I still didn't

0:30:17.420,0:30:23.120
want to watch anything else so I watched

0:30:19.670,0:30:26.120
the first season think I was ready

0:30:23.120,0:30:29.780
um but I have not have not found a new

0:30:26.120,0:30:32.600
thing since then since then well if you

0:30:29.780,0:30:35.090
watch the wire okay

0:30:32.600,0:30:38.740
I watched the wire on TV at Frank's

0:30:35.090,0:30:43.490
house ah yeah dopey unless he has

0:30:38.740,0:30:46.580
equipment uh-huh yes yeah like quality

0:30:43.490,0:30:47.510
equipment um well I'll think of some

0:30:46.580,0:30:52.510
some other ones

0:30:47.510,0:30:54.950
I'm sure oh yeah we should talk about

0:30:52.510,0:31:02.330
I'll definitely let you know because we

0:30:54.950,0:31:11.270
watch a lot of okay all right moving

0:31:02.330,0:31:14.300
along no that's good I mean like you

0:31:11.270,0:31:19.160
know it's about being a person

0:31:14.300,0:31:21.580
so you're you kind of that's I gotta

0:31:19.160,0:31:24.110
kind of adjust on the fly here but I

0:31:21.580,0:31:26.000
think I'll just skip these because you

0:31:24.110,0:31:27.980
don't really you know you don't write

0:31:26.000,0:31:29.600
any poems on the iPad you never have

0:31:27.980,0:31:31.340
them in digital format until they go to

0:31:29.600,0:31:33.370
your publisher essentially and then

0:31:31.340,0:31:37.430
though how do you know how they do it

0:31:33.370,0:31:40.850
you send them a type script because then

0:31:37.430,0:31:42.500
I have to prove the digital and be sure

0:31:40.850,0:31:46.400
there haven't been mistakes

0:31:42.500,0:31:48.480
yeah always huge mistake hmm I could pay

0:31:46.400,0:31:50.580
somebody to do it but it would still be

0:31:48.480,0:31:54.480
same problem same happy yeah prove it

0:31:50.580,0:31:56.790
yeah um I imagine that I'm stuck with

0:31:54.480,0:31:59.669
that for life because I cannot imagine

0:31:56.790,0:32:01.679
typing poems on that so when you you say

0:31:59.669,0:32:03.960
that F is G and then someone types like

0:32:01.679,0:32:04.919
or do they scan it and then I mean do

0:32:03.960,0:32:07.290
you know how they do it

0:32:04.919,0:32:09.419
no okay cuz I mean there are ways they

0:32:07.290,0:32:13.260
should be what I can tell you know if

0:32:09.419,0:32:16.650
you wanna ask yeah um do you want em hmm

0:32:13.260,0:32:18.059
maybe I don't know I I'm just I mean

0:32:16.650,0:32:19.799
it's just sort of in inin but you then

0:32:18.059,0:32:20.669
once they do that then they send it back

0:32:19.799,0:32:22.110
to you and you make sure that

0:32:20.669,0:32:23.190
everything's right and then I mean you

0:32:22.110,0:32:25.559
go back and forth with them with the

0:32:23.190,0:32:26.850
proofs for quite a bit right I remember

0:32:25.559,0:32:29.460
when I was a student I think you had

0:32:26.850,0:32:31.950
would have been beaten OVA you were

0:32:29.460,0:32:33.120
working on her for seven ages and you

0:32:31.950,0:32:35.820
were telling me how you were reading it

0:32:33.120,0:32:37.770
backwards no so yeah how much that

0:32:35.820,0:32:42.270
what's the thing you do horrible yeah

0:32:37.770,0:32:43.770
that's great because you can't you it's

0:32:42.270,0:32:46.140
in your book and you you hear it pretty

0:32:43.770,0:32:50.669
you know you you remember your palms are

0:32:46.140,0:32:52.290
fairly memorized almost all of them so

0:32:50.669,0:32:53.610
like once and especially when you're

0:32:52.290,0:32:55.890
working in the book like when you're

0:32:53.610,0:32:58.470
going back through you're hearing it you

0:32:55.890,0:33:01.710
you're I make substitutions so unless

0:32:58.470,0:33:04.940
you unless you read it out of order

0:33:01.710,0:33:10.770
yeah you're gonna be doing that yeah

0:33:04.940,0:33:12.450
yeah um okay well it so that was the

0:33:10.770,0:33:14.040
first section but there's not much to it

0:33:12.450,0:33:17.309
because it's mostly digital but then

0:33:14.040,0:33:19.860
this is more practice and so I've kind

0:33:17.309,0:33:21.600
of delineated the writing process into

0:33:19.860,0:33:23.690
kind of a three-step sort of things so

0:33:21.600,0:33:25.950
there's the composition there's the

0:33:23.690,0:33:27.660
there's the revision and then there's

0:33:25.950,0:33:30.000
the sort of organizational archival

0:33:27.660,0:33:31.380
point and that's just my kind of

0:33:30.000,0:33:32.520
construction for this interview if that

0:33:31.380,0:33:37.080
doesn't make sense to you we could talk

0:33:32.520,0:33:39.090
about in different ways so and I have I

0:33:37.080,0:33:40.410
have kind of like the beginning

0:33:39.090,0:33:42.570
questions which is kind of to give us an

0:33:40.410,0:33:44.669
art like a idea about the arc of your

0:33:42.570,0:33:45.960
career but and this question I'm sure

0:33:44.669,0:33:49.010
you'll love but how long have you been

0:33:45.960,0:33:51.670
writing professionally would you say

0:33:49.010,0:33:55.570
well I was trying to write for

0:33:51.670,0:33:57.580
additionally I've been writing since I

0:33:55.570,0:33:59.860
was a child and I had a very high

0:33:57.580,0:34:05.590
opinion that my early work so I was

0:33:59.860,0:34:13.929
sending books out to publishers in my

0:34:05.590,0:34:24.900
early teens oh really Wow but I did have

0:34:13.929,0:34:28.929
I did have that intense dream and I

0:34:24.900,0:34:33.940
developed it as as anybody has to a very

0:34:28.929,0:34:36.550
tough skin I mean I have enormous vanity

0:34:33.940,0:34:39.040
you know every time one was rejected

0:34:36.550,0:34:41.530
didn't matter that I was 15 years old I

0:34:39.040,0:34:44.500
thought I'm never gonna write better

0:34:41.530,0:34:51.160
than this this is this is the climax of

0:34:44.500,0:34:53.710
my vision and no one wants that yeah

0:34:51.160,0:34:59.140
that was how hard but I continued to

0:34:53.710,0:35:01.750
send things out and when I had when I

0:34:59.140,0:35:06.130
started working on what became my first

0:35:01.750,0:35:08.670
book I was in my late teens and from the

0:35:06.130,0:35:11.809
time I was I think 23

0:35:08.670,0:35:14.490
this was published I think when I was 25

0:35:11.809,0:35:20.339
something like that

0:35:14.490,0:35:24.210
I had I think 28 rejections okay a real

0:35:20.339,0:35:30.569
law but I had some poems in magazines

0:35:24.210,0:35:35.190
mm-hmm but it was all of that was in

0:35:30.569,0:35:39.720
place by the time I was probably 12 that

0:35:35.190,0:35:41.700
sort of ambition and drive yeah yeah and

0:35:39.720,0:35:43.770
then there were long periods of not

0:35:41.700,0:35:50.930
writing at all that were harrowing

0:35:43.770,0:35:54.930
continue to be have mm-hmm and I had

0:35:50.930,0:35:57.630
different mechanisms for trying to get

0:35:54.930,0:36:03.990
through them the greatest discovery was

0:35:57.630,0:36:07.410
teaching because I finally learned after

0:36:03.990,0:36:09.119
the first really lengthy this is

0:36:07.410,0:36:10.440
completely off the track of what you

0:36:09.119,0:36:11.940
want no it's absolutely no no the my

0:36:10.440,0:36:15.119
next question was described the arc of

0:36:11.940,0:36:17.869
your career so this night well the first

0:36:15.119,0:36:21.500
time that that happened I went I

0:36:17.869,0:36:24.540
firstborn had been published and I had

0:36:21.500,0:36:29.010
not only did it happen I've pretty much

0:36:24.540,0:36:34.109
done what I what was in me to do mm-hmm

0:36:29.010,0:36:36.119
I had also formed evolved the style in

0:36:34.109,0:36:38.119
which there were no complete sentences

0:36:36.119,0:36:44.339
they were just little bullet-like

0:36:38.119,0:36:47.910
fragments and every time I thought to

0:36:44.339,0:36:50.160
write I couldn't I couldn't no longer I

0:36:47.910,0:36:51.020
can't make this in so it's gonna be

0:36:50.160,0:36:53.060
grammatical but

0:36:51.020,0:36:57.080
could no longer it was it struck me

0:36:53.060,0:37:03.530
write a sentence so I realized there was

0:36:57.080,0:37:07.900
something about that bad particular wall

0:37:03.530,0:37:12.560
that I had hit that had to do with

0:37:07.900,0:37:17.330
syntax and I thought I have I have to

0:37:12.560,0:37:20.109
write poems like no sonnet on his

0:37:17.330,0:37:23.049
blindness that are all ones

0:37:20.109,0:37:27.160
or as close to that as I can manage yeah

0:37:23.049,0:37:29.619
and I couldn't do it I couldn't do

0:37:27.160,0:37:31.630
anything that approached it and I

0:37:29.619,0:37:35.499
couldn't at the same time write

0:37:31.630,0:37:39.039
fragments anymore and the more I

0:37:35.499,0:37:41.289
couldn't write the more I repudiated the

0:37:39.039,0:37:44.979
world I thought that the problem was

0:37:41.289,0:37:48.369
that I was too worldly too involved in

0:37:44.979,0:37:53.459
the world too diverse in my interest so

0:37:48.369,0:37:57.130
I became more and more hermetic man

0:37:53.459,0:37:59.019
dedicated and I would sit at this was

0:37:57.130,0:38:02.349
living in Provincetown for part of this

0:37:59.019,0:38:05.079
time in New York City and I would sit in

0:38:02.349,0:38:07.989
Provincetown at a very beautiful desk

0:38:05.079,0:38:12.539
that was made for me by my photographer

0:38:07.989,0:38:19.900
boyfriend with all of these marvelous

0:38:12.539,0:38:23.529
objects to gaze at and I heart

0:38:19.900,0:38:27.939
horrifying and you know on a good day I

0:38:23.529,0:38:30.069
would write an article but had a really

0:38:27.939,0:38:33.729
good day there would be a noun you know

0:38:30.069,0:38:36.539
tree but you know we never moved yeah I

0:38:33.729,0:38:41.170
couldn't get beyond that and I thought

0:38:36.539,0:38:43.959
I'm not I have not consecrated myself

0:38:41.170,0:38:51.339
sufficiently there needs to be more for

0:38:43.959,0:38:56.529
swearing and I fine I had I had a bed of

0:38:51.339,0:39:01.470
nails kind of life just sitting in the

0:38:56.529,0:39:05.240
sort of soup of my failure for a year

0:39:01.470,0:39:08.369
and during that time I had one or two

0:39:05.240,0:39:12.030
teaching job offers in those years it

0:39:08.369,0:39:14.640
was very much easier because you the

0:39:12.030,0:39:17.210
economy was different and you know there

0:39:14.640,0:39:21.270
weren't all these MFA programs

0:39:17.210,0:39:24.330
especially if you were female I had a

0:39:21.270,0:39:26.670
book out and I don't know that I would

0:39:24.330,0:39:30.570
have gotten a tenure track job given my

0:39:26.670,0:39:37.080
spotty education but I I could certainly

0:39:30.570,0:39:39.660
I had these offers hmm and I kept saying

0:39:37.080,0:39:42.330
no no no no because poets shouldn't

0:39:39.660,0:39:44.880
teach I mean there was that long long

0:39:42.330,0:39:46.859
list of things poets shit'll do yeah I

0:39:44.880,0:39:49.440
should never have children they

0:39:46.859,0:39:57.420
shouldn't teach they shouldn't go out in

0:39:49.440,0:39:59.849
the world they can eat but finally I was

0:39:57.420,0:40:04.710
invited to do a colloquium in Vermont

0:39:59.849,0:40:08.310
and I hated Provincetown but I I didn't

0:40:04.710,0:40:10.589
I didn't know how I didn't want to just

0:40:08.310,0:40:13.740
begin moving and to sort of pin the tail

0:40:10.589,0:40:16.109
on the map kind of way I was making my

0:40:13.740,0:40:22.589
living as a secretary I could have done

0:40:16.109,0:40:29.280
that anywhere in that period hmm but I

0:40:22.589,0:40:32.490
thought I'll just stay here until the

0:40:29.280,0:40:35.130
future presents itself so I went to do

0:40:32.490,0:40:37.410
this colloquium partly because John

0:40:35.130,0:40:38.540
Barrowman was there he was a hero of

0:40:37.410,0:40:41.660
mine and I

0:40:38.540,0:40:45.470
to be able to pay tribute to him I

0:40:41.660,0:40:50.090
wanted to say you are great artist

0:40:45.470,0:40:52.730
mm-hmm and I salute you which I did get

0:40:50.090,0:40:55.760
to say but he thought I was just you

0:40:52.730,0:40:57.860
know a chick on the make it was really I

0:40:55.760,0:41:00.140
didn't know how to say to him you don't

0:40:57.860,0:41:02.710
understand I've never said these words

0:41:00.140,0:41:02.710
yeah

0:41:03.010,0:41:08.450
in any case I realized about the minute

0:41:06.830,0:41:13.340
I got to Vermont I thought I'm supposed

0:41:08.450,0:41:16.010
to live here I just instantly love the

0:41:13.340,0:41:20.120
place and it was a four-day thing and

0:41:16.010,0:41:22.450
there were all these you know English

0:41:20.120,0:41:24.680
teachers at Goddard College hippy

0:41:22.450,0:41:26.540
institution with a naked dorm

0:41:24.680,0:41:29.530
Amina's like that and they said you

0:41:26.540,0:41:34.220
should come here and teach and I thought

0:41:29.530,0:41:39.140
why not I'm not the poet I have to face

0:41:34.220,0:41:42.680
this disastrous fact mm-hmm and make a

0:41:39.140,0:41:45.020
life so I say yes and of course they

0:41:42.680,0:41:46.820
weren't doing parent offer me a job

0:41:45.020,0:41:50.780
they were just drunk and English

0:41:46.820,0:41:55.010
teachers writing to me great but by then

0:41:50.780,0:41:57.230
I had had a sort of Epiphany and we I

0:41:55.010,0:42:02.100
corresponded with two of those people

0:41:57.230,0:42:08.440
who are my still oldest

0:42:02.100,0:42:13.330
dearest friends Ellen Voight and prose

0:42:08.440,0:42:16.030
writer Katherine Davis mm-hmm and by the

0:42:13.330,0:42:19.780
three days before the semester started

0:42:16.030,0:42:24.640
there there was a job cobbled together

0:42:19.780,0:42:26.770
for me for one semester and I moved to

0:42:24.640,0:42:30.340
Vermont and I got a room in a rooming

0:42:26.770,0:42:33.340
house with a bathroom down the hall

0:42:30.340,0:42:37.210
and the minute I started teaching I

0:42:33.340,0:42:40.300
started writing again and I still feel

0:42:37.210,0:42:43.710
about teaching that is a kind of it's

0:42:40.300,0:42:46.960
the most miraculous thing I ever

0:42:43.710,0:42:49.360
discovered because I can't always write

0:42:46.960,0:42:52.270
and a lot of periods go by and I don't

0:42:49.360,0:42:56.230
write but I can always teach and I will

0:42:52.270,0:42:59.470
always need people who fascinate me

0:42:56.230,0:43:02.380
who are doing things with lines that go

0:42:59.470,0:43:06.940
places my mind has never gone and I

0:43:02.380,0:43:09.550
won't find that stuff in books by dead

0:43:06.940,0:43:15.720
people and contemporaries yeah new

0:43:09.550,0:43:19.420
sounding stuff and it changes me and

0:43:15.720,0:43:22.270
electrifies me and to work on the

0:43:19.420,0:43:24.430
material that's still malleable it was

0:43:22.270,0:43:27.060
it was the experience of working on my

0:43:24.430,0:43:27.060
own stuff

0:43:29.010,0:43:38.369
but I didn't feel competitive I didn't

0:43:32.010,0:43:39.930
feel a lot I was so strange because I am

0:43:38.369,0:43:43.349
very competitive

0:43:39.930,0:43:45.810
yeah but not with my students and I

0:43:43.349,0:43:51.440
wanted those poems to be as great as

0:43:45.810,0:43:55.560
they could be or in my view mm-hmm

0:43:51.440,0:43:59.369
and so that's what that's still that's

0:43:55.560,0:44:02.040
served me very well and especially once

0:43:59.369,0:44:05.339
I discovered undergraduates because I

0:44:02.040,0:44:09.390
couldn't know them for four years and I

0:44:05.339,0:44:11.730
loved and Williams was Williams was

0:44:09.390,0:44:15.570
Nirvana you know I do not there and I

0:44:11.730,0:44:19.170
thought I've never been around such

0:44:15.570,0:44:23.430
smart people yeah I was terrified but I

0:44:19.170,0:44:25.320
also was thrilled and you know that a

0:44:23.430,0:44:28.140
lot of those years were years when I

0:44:25.320,0:44:30.780
couldn't do anything but then some of

0:44:28.140,0:44:34.349
them were years when I was writing a

0:44:30.780,0:44:34.800
blue streak and teaching and it was

0:44:34.349,0:44:37.829
never

0:44:34.800,0:44:40.530
oh I teach one semester and then I write

0:44:37.829,0:44:43.800
or I teach and I write in between

0:44:40.530,0:44:48.300
classes no I mean if I was writing I

0:44:43.800,0:44:51.210
would write when I taught and then and

0:44:48.300,0:44:52.559
in fact after the experience in

0:44:51.210,0:44:59.939
Provincetown at this

0:44:52.559,0:45:03.539
desk I I have a horror of the special

0:44:59.939,0:45:06.959
place yeah the you know secluded cabin

0:45:03.539,0:45:10.140
the writers retreat I just can't bear

0:45:06.959,0:45:13.619
them I I want to be and I want to be

0:45:10.140,0:45:17.249
without tools I often have no pencil and

0:45:13.619,0:45:21.150
no paper so I have to borrow them or or

0:45:17.249,0:45:25.619
buy them but I don't want to presume

0:45:21.150,0:45:29.039
anything I just died there's going to be

0:45:25.619,0:45:31.949
a line coming into my head that would be

0:45:29.039,0:45:36.150
great yeah and when I'm working on

0:45:31.949,0:45:41.670
something then it so so the shape has

0:45:36.150,0:45:44.880
always been periods are in the desert

0:45:41.670,0:45:50.249
you know without a language yeah some

0:45:44.880,0:45:52.380
and then work which was set in after I

0:45:50.249,0:45:58.849
was 50 there were most of my books

0:45:52.380,0:46:01.279
written very fast like six eight weeks

0:45:58.849,0:46:06.420
heywhat which book did that start with

0:46:01.279,0:46:09.869
the wild life to others and after that I

0:46:06.420,0:46:12.979
thought I can do anything I can fly

0:46:09.869,0:46:16.859
planes and I remember my husband saying

0:46:12.979,0:46:20.349
you are going to really hit the wall

0:46:16.859,0:46:27.549
very soon yeah and he was right

0:46:20.349,0:46:28.749
I develop neurological symptoms the

0:46:27.549,0:46:30.519
whole Wyatts

0:46:28.749,0:46:34.420
I have not slept the whole of that

0:46:30.519,0:46:37.299
summer practically hmm and one side of

0:46:34.420,0:46:39.400
my face started twitching and I had to

0:46:37.299,0:46:42.220
teach that fall and I remember sitting

0:46:39.400,0:46:46.930
in class like this so that nobody would

0:46:42.220,0:46:49.779
see that my face was long and the

0:46:46.930,0:46:53.380
neurologist said I don't think this is

0:46:49.779,0:46:57.039
anything you mean it'll probably go away

0:46:53.380,0:46:59.200
in a couple of months which it did but

0:46:57.039,0:47:01.089
every so often I think something like

0:46:59.200,0:47:09.279
that could come back again you know just

0:47:01.089,0:47:10.839
some some we I mean it was it's weird to

0:47:09.279,0:47:13.960
write that fast and you don't have a

0:47:10.839,0:47:21.160
sense of agency very hard to revise

0:47:13.960,0:47:25.029
because yeah you can't picture you you

0:47:21.160,0:47:27.880
don't have you don't remember writing it

0:47:25.029,0:47:37.269
you just were sitting there and then it

0:47:27.880,0:47:42.989
was and the the last two books village

0:47:37.269,0:47:42.989
life and then they were slower what

0:47:44.390,0:47:51.660
there were they were standing so this

0:47:48.439,0:47:53.309
especially village life the newer one

0:47:51.660,0:47:55.589
there were lots of moments when I

0:47:53.309,0:47:57.269
thought this is never going to be a book

0:47:55.589,0:48:00.619
I don't know how to put this material

0:47:57.269,0:48:00.619
together mm-hmm

0:48:00.769,0:48:06.420
so I mean if you think back when you

0:48:04.439,0:48:08.579
before you hit this sort of stride where

0:48:06.420,0:48:10.439
you were reducing books very quickly I

0:48:08.579,0:48:14.130
mean what what was it like say writing

0:48:10.439,0:48:25.829
have some marshals or long okay it took

0:48:14.130,0:48:29.640
many years I I revised poems heavily and

0:48:25.829,0:48:33.209
constantly one poem I remember took two

0:48:29.640,0:48:35.579
years to write for my mother mm-hmm the

0:48:33.209,0:48:38.369
opening lines it was better when we work

0:48:35.579,0:48:41.009
together in one body I had those lines

0:48:38.369,0:48:46.589
in my head for a really long time and at

0:48:41.009,0:48:49.079
the beginning at the beginning I felt

0:48:46.589,0:48:52.679
very grateful because I thought o-22

0:48:49.079,0:48:54.630
really beautiful lines this is going to

0:48:52.679,0:48:57.420
be a poem and I'm screaming this is

0:48:54.630,0:49:02.420
exciting I have at least these lines to

0:48:57.420,0:49:04.579
cling to and then time went by and

0:49:02.420,0:49:08.839
nothing happened no other language

0:49:04.579,0:49:12.020
attached to that little shard and so

0:49:08.839,0:49:14.480
that those those phrases that language

0:49:12.020,0:49:16.760
became a torment was the first thing out

0:49:14.480,0:49:19.760
here in the morning murmured in my head

0:49:16.760,0:49:22.369
the last thing I would hear at night but

0:49:19.760,0:49:25.940
it was it was a chastisement a torment

0:49:22.369,0:49:30.349
you you don't know what I'm for

0:49:25.940,0:49:32.960
right and I tried to convince myself it

0:49:30.349,0:49:35.200
was a high coat you know thought well

0:49:32.960,0:49:40.220
maybe it's just a very austere

0:49:35.200,0:49:43.910
abbreviated mm-hmm but I didn't think

0:49:40.220,0:49:50.839
that and nobody I showed it to thought

0:49:43.910,0:49:53.510
that either so that took really a very

0:49:50.839,0:49:58.480
very very very long time to write and

0:49:53.510,0:50:01.280
had lots of different approaches and

0:49:58.480,0:50:04.700
ended up being a kind of collage of

0:50:01.280,0:50:07.609
pieces of language from different old

0:50:04.700,0:50:09.079
poems and during that time you weren't

0:50:07.609,0:50:11.720
where you just were working on the one

0:50:09.079,0:50:13.040
poem I was for a long time yeah and so

0:50:11.720,0:50:14.680
there weren't other poems coming in and

0:50:13.040,0:50:17.599
out of this it's just and that is that

0:50:14.680,0:50:19.430
traditionally how you work or there is

0:50:17.599,0:50:22.099
one poem and then the next moment then

0:50:19.430,0:50:24.470
when we finished it yeah yeah and then

0:50:22.099,0:50:26.599
sometimes I sometimes there'll be a

0:50:24.470,0:50:32.809
massive revision you know oh you know

0:50:26.599,0:50:36.650
what one addition to an accumulating

0:50:32.809,0:50:41.340
manuscript makes it clear how the things

0:50:36.650,0:50:45.800
should be ordered and

0:50:41.340,0:50:49.830
see you can make a lot of short little

0:50:45.800,0:50:53.610
changes and the other stuff because of

0:50:49.830,0:50:58.530
this new thing but so some of the books

0:50:53.610,0:51:01.310
are slower some are the earlier books

0:50:58.530,0:51:08.760
were revised much more the lighter books

0:51:01.310,0:51:13.460
less mm-hmm those though they were there

0:51:08.760,0:51:13.460
were revisions and all of them and

0:51:13.670,0:51:25.830
though most of them proceeded at some

0:51:17.580,0:51:29.910
point rapidly from I would say over a no

0:51:25.830,0:51:34.890
on that were there were hiatuses like

0:51:29.910,0:51:37.670
the Verona was written into fast periods

0:51:34.890,0:51:40.200
and the aged one October because I mean

0:51:37.670,0:51:43.440
that was such a good chat book and yeah

0:51:40.200,0:51:45.840
okay yeah and I had October and I had

0:51:43.440,0:51:47.520
prism great and I thought these people

0:51:45.840,0:51:50.700
these two poems can't be in the same

0:51:47.520,0:51:55.950
book I mean they're just complete

0:51:50.700,0:51:59.580
opposites and then there were two years

0:51:55.950,0:52:02.180
when I wrote nothing hmm and I keep it I

0:51:59.580,0:52:06.290
haven't attended to this

0:52:02.180,0:52:11.990
years but from many decades I kept this

0:52:06.290,0:52:15.320
chart of what I wrote when and each year

0:52:11.990,0:52:18.350
would be written at the top of it

0:52:15.320,0:52:20.180
no the years were like that and the

0:52:18.350,0:52:21.950
months were like that mm-hmm

0:52:20.180,0:52:24.140
and if I wrote a poem then I would write

0:52:21.950,0:52:28.640
its name and if I wrote nothing I would

0:52:24.140,0:52:30.350
write an X and so I would when I got

0:52:28.640,0:52:32.630
depressed I would take this thing out

0:52:30.350,0:52:37.370
and I would see all these lines of X's

0:52:32.630,0:52:40.970
and then they would be at the end that

0:52:37.370,0:52:43.220
would be a little gust and a little gust

0:52:40.970,0:52:46.370
would be completely different from what

0:52:43.220,0:52:52.880
had preceded the X's yeah so I began to

0:52:46.370,0:52:55.580
be I mean I trust a little strong but I

0:52:52.880,0:52:58.430
just figured this is how I it goes

0:52:55.580,0:53:04.070
through me and there's a period usually

0:52:58.430,0:53:08.300
now after I finished something of being

0:53:04.070,0:53:12.770
happy as I go I don't have to write yeah

0:53:08.300,0:53:15.980
I feel kind of on vacation and I have a

0:53:12.770,0:53:18.290
sense of secret pleasure has no one

0:53:15.980,0:53:19.250
seeing it and no one's has anything to

0:53:18.290,0:53:23.050
say about it

0:53:19.250,0:53:23.050
mm-hmm but I loved it and

0:53:24.670,0:53:37.840
and it's finished and I like last year

0:53:33.350,0:53:37.840
was such a happy year for that reason

0:53:48.430,0:53:59.600
yeah you just play back they made me

0:53:57.830,0:54:05.800
take my I think this beautiful Atlantic

0:53:59.600,0:54:08.450
trunks and all with salad on paws of

0:54:05.800,0:54:12.650
pussy-willow uh-huh

0:54:08.450,0:54:18.530
I remember that yeah myself still for

0:54:12.650,0:54:20.780
grounded in my brain anyway so so kill

0:54:18.530,0:54:24.230
the rest of those poems in the Brno were

0:54:20.780,0:54:31.610
written after this two year gap mm-hmm

0:54:24.230,0:54:35.140
and very fast really fast and none of it

0:54:31.610,0:54:38.600
figured out I mean I didn't have

0:54:35.140,0:54:41.300
Persephone I didn't have didn't have to

0:54:38.600,0:54:43.430
serve I'm hurt me everything

0:54:41.300,0:54:47.320
yeah I've been reading a lot of Henning

0:54:43.430,0:54:47.320
Mankell and I was trying to put

0:54:48.380,0:54:54.109
an image from each of his novels and one

0:54:51.499,0:54:57.309
of my poems oh okay

0:54:54.109,0:54:59.599
is he is he a mystery writer yeah okay

0:54:57.309,0:55:01.729
Swedish Swedish I was

0:54:59.599,0:55:06.619
I hate travel but I was is this the near

0:55:01.729,0:55:10.400
wolf book Nero Wolfe mirror okay okay

0:55:06.619,0:55:15.710
no that's reps doubt that was from much

0:55:10.400,0:55:20.869
longer ago no Michael is living okay

0:55:15.710,0:55:25.880
Swedish married to one of a more

0:55:20.869,0:55:30.559
Bergman's daughters well yeah and I

0:55:25.880,0:55:32.960
think he's a genius I love those books I

0:55:30.559,0:55:36.319
think he's a great brother stylist I

0:55:32.960,0:55:38.029
would recommend them start with one step

0:55:36.319,0:55:39.650
behind though don't start at the

0:55:38.029,0:55:43.299
beginning because the first book is not

0:55:39.650,0:55:48.440
good and you wouldn't read the rest okay

0:55:43.299,0:55:51.530
but very dreary compelling

0:55:48.440,0:55:51.530
[Music]

0:55:51.590,0:56:02.720
it's there's there's his detective plugs

0:55:58.400,0:56:05.780
ahead and he you know he notices small

0:56:02.720,0:56:08.380
things that don't make sense and turns

0:56:05.780,0:56:09.710
them over in his mind but he's not a

0:56:08.380,0:56:14.990
firebrand

0:56:09.710,0:56:20.150
he's not handsome man and there's a kind

0:56:14.990,0:56:25.010
of dreary sameness to his days but the

0:56:20.150,0:56:28.670
book the books are fantastic and what

0:56:25.010,0:56:30.230
they what they they're notion of what

0:56:28.670,0:56:33.170
triumph is mm-hmm

0:56:30.230,0:56:40.100
triumph is persistence and then it turns

0:56:33.170,0:56:42.380
into comprehension you know a pattern is

0:56:40.100,0:56:45.830
revealed yeah it's what they're really

0:56:42.380,0:56:49.930
I'd love them so I was reading those and

0:56:45.830,0:56:52.370
I think something of his prose style

0:56:49.930,0:56:57.290
crept into my poems

0:56:52.370,0:57:00.440
hmm I don't know that another person

0:56:57.290,0:57:02.600
would think that but in in Averno or I

0:57:00.440,0:57:03.980
mean you never know did it transfer

0:57:02.600,0:57:11.810
through into a village what life at all

0:57:03.980,0:57:13.430
no that was book yeah so if we started

0:57:11.810,0:57:15.560
so so you had your first sort of period

0:57:13.430,0:57:19.580
of silence after first born and until

0:57:15.560,0:57:21.050
you started teaching at Goddard and then

0:57:19.580,0:57:23.300
was it was it like that sort of like a

0:57:21.050,0:57:25.340
repetition every time I mean if you

0:57:23.300,0:57:27.020
finished a book didn't you

0:57:25.340,0:57:28.430
I mean you had the pleasure but then you

0:57:27.020,0:57:31.400
also had the silence or did some

0:57:28.430,0:57:33.850
someone's jumpsuit was yeah yeah with

0:57:31.400,0:57:38.810
with marshland there were a lot of

0:57:33.850,0:57:42.110
silences in Darien took about seven

0:57:38.810,0:57:44.890
years okay I mean first one was

0:57:42.110,0:57:44.890
published and

0:57:45.109,0:57:56.660
1968 but it was finished in 66 hmm and

0:57:51.660,0:58:00.029
how son Marchand was 75 so it didn't I

0:57:56.660,0:58:03.599
was put in touch with Dan helper and who

0:58:00.029,0:58:08.609
was starting echo by Stanley Kunitz

0:58:03.599,0:58:11.549
family said this this young sport loves

0:58:08.609,0:58:14.069
your work and I thought you know I don't

0:58:11.549,0:58:18.359
want to have to send this out 28 times

0:58:14.069,0:58:21.719
yeah and so I thought I just felt with

0:58:18.359,0:58:26.999
someone family recommends who loves it

0:58:21.719,0:58:29.160
mm-hmm so it was published pretty soon

0:58:26.999,0:58:32.910
after it was done so that was a very

0:58:29.160,0:58:36.119
very long boo period but I feel as

0:58:32.910,0:58:39.689
though firstborn is just an artifact

0:58:36.119,0:58:42.059
from another life and that really by

0:58:39.689,0:58:42.900
writing life began with the house on

0:58:42.059,0:58:48.059
marshland

0:58:42.900,0:58:52.160
and I think you know I can see how each

0:58:48.059,0:58:54.749
book came out of its predecessor mm-hmm

0:58:52.160,0:58:57.900
after that what do you what do you mean

0:58:54.749,0:58:59.489
by that can you see like the dew point

0:58:57.900,0:59:02.880
poems in the previous book that were

0:58:59.489,0:59:04.499
harbingers of the next or you just or

0:59:02.880,0:59:06.390
sort of terms of language I know you

0:59:04.499,0:59:08.039
also I mean you speak in your interviews

0:59:06.390,0:59:09.989
about how you go through and try to kind

0:59:08.039,0:59:11.969
of eliminate the language of the one

0:59:09.989,0:59:17.069
book before you yeah but even in that

0:59:11.969,0:59:20.219
sense so that you certain stylistic

0:59:17.069,0:59:22.999
takes you you try to recognize and

0:59:20.219,0:59:28.890
prohibit the way I tried to prohibit

0:59:22.999,0:59:35.380
fragments but they seem like the work of

0:59:28.890,0:59:41.930
the same person not some sort of journey

0:59:35.380,0:59:44.540
and I try to make them as different as

0:59:41.930,0:59:46.400
possible what and what is the I mean I'm

0:59:44.540,0:59:48.560
interested in what the work of doing

0:59:46.400,0:59:50.000
that is I mean is it you've just lived

0:59:48.560,0:59:51.980
with these poems so often that you

0:59:50.000,0:59:53.960
recognize immediately what the stylistic

0:59:51.980,0:59:55.430
tics are and that they're easy to do or

0:59:53.960,0:59:57.020
is it something that when you read

0:59:55.430,0:59:59.089
through the book and it's finished

0:59:57.020,1:00:00.079
formula oh I see that and I see that and

0:59:59.089,1:00:03.589
these are the things that I need to

1:00:00.079,1:00:05.599
really work about eliminating I never

1:00:03.589,1:00:07.910
see it when I'm working on the book yeah

1:00:05.599,1:00:10.880
which would be probably suffocating yeah

1:00:07.910,1:00:16.910
yeah so it's only afterward I think well

1:00:10.880,1:00:19.760
I can't do that again and and then

1:00:16.910,1:00:21.560
someone's you see isn't things like

1:00:19.760,1:00:24.589
isn't it odd I've never used a

1:00:21.560,1:00:27.829
contraction ever and then you think well

1:00:24.589,1:00:30.380
I guess I have to figure out how to use

1:00:27.829,1:00:34.780
a contraction and that becomes a whole

1:00:30.380,1:00:38.660
with what you realize is that that's

1:00:34.780,1:00:43.250
quotidian speech that was what I hadn't

1:00:38.660,1:00:47.630
used I mean so then you look in order to

1:00:43.250,1:00:50.960
use contractions and questions you the

1:00:47.630,1:00:56.359
Delphic voice evaporates and the human

1:00:50.960,1:00:58.780
is introduced in its place and that was

1:00:56.359,1:01:03.670
a hard moment because a lot of people

1:00:58.780,1:01:07.069
who admire my work admire that for

1:01:03.670,1:01:09.680
exactly the thing that was now no longer

1:01:07.069,1:01:12.380
present and when when what what period

1:01:09.680,1:01:16.160
was this um between which I felt

1:01:12.380,1:01:18.050
achilles okay so coming into triumph

1:01:16.160,1:01:20.720
achilles that was that that was the one

1:01:18.050,1:01:21.890
of the ticks that you were burnt that

1:01:20.720,1:01:30.230
was one of the changes that was being

1:01:21.890,1:01:35.109
made yeah right and then so go triumph

1:01:30.230,1:01:37.180
Achilles to the next one

1:01:35.109,1:01:40.380
Ararat and then Meadowlands and then

1:01:37.180,1:01:45.190
wild iris no other way wild iris

1:01:40.380,1:01:46.690
Meadowlands oh wow I was in okay you're

1:01:45.190,1:01:48.069
pretty car I'm pretty close

1:01:46.690,1:01:49.690
I've been reading The Collected and I'm

1:01:48.069,1:01:51.069
just it's so interesting to kind of like

1:01:49.690,1:01:53.079
move through time as you're moving

1:01:51.069,1:01:54.789
through yeah what did you feel about

1:01:53.079,1:01:59.380
that I mean by publishing The Collected

1:01:54.789,1:02:02.049
Poems oh it it's surprised to me yes I

1:01:59.380,1:02:03.759
always thought it was a terrible idea

1:02:02.049,1:02:07.359
well first of all it's not the collected

1:02:03.759,1:02:10.660
and I didn't think of it as that but

1:02:07.359,1:02:15.249
it's fifty years of writing and yeah and

1:02:10.660,1:02:18.369
I was initially appalled and then amazed

1:02:15.249,1:02:20.980
at its size because I thought it would

1:02:18.369,1:02:24.269
be about 300 pages long and that when

1:02:20.980,1:02:29.460
Miranda said it was six and initially

1:02:24.269,1:02:32.109
688 said no one will buy this we have to

1:02:29.460,1:02:35.829
squeeze it it has to get a little er

1:02:32.109,1:02:37.809
yeah I thought I thought it was a

1:02:35.829,1:02:40.989
valedictory gesture I thought it was

1:02:37.809,1:02:43.930
suicidal to do most of my life I I was I

1:02:40.989,1:02:47.079
was repelled by it in principle the idea

1:02:43.930,1:02:53.950
of doing it myself was horrifying mm-hmm

1:02:47.079,1:02:57.099
and I I had begun to feel I mean I never

1:02:53.950,1:03:05.259
read my old books you think I mean what

1:02:57.099,1:03:09.239
I don't have no reason to but at some

1:03:05.259,1:03:11.829
point I had to do something from from a

1:03:09.239,1:03:15.369
bunch of books or I had to do reading

1:03:11.829,1:03:19.970
and I and I was asked

1:03:15.369,1:03:23.960
dude yeah so I was reading through the

1:03:19.970,1:03:26.869
books and I I didn't hate them I mean

1:03:23.960,1:03:29.240
often once I know you finishing your

1:03:26.869,1:03:31.700
euphoric and then pretty - pretty soon

1:03:29.240,1:03:38.720
you feel a sense of humiliation and

1:03:31.700,1:03:44.690
shame you're just yes think about what

1:03:38.720,1:03:46.190
you've just done so then after that you

1:03:44.690,1:03:52.369
don't go back and you know then you're

1:03:46.190,1:03:59.569
trying to prove you can right mm-hmm by

1:03:52.369,1:04:01.970
writing something else or you know the

1:03:59.569,1:04:11.300
book gets horrible reviews and you had

1:04:01.970,1:04:18.650
this feeling nothing I'll show you the

1:04:11.300,1:04:20.810
people's pants poke yeah but I I was

1:04:18.650,1:04:23.630
reading these old books I'm thinking

1:04:20.810,1:04:27.230
they and I like them and I was proud

1:04:23.630,1:04:31.010
that I wrote them and I remember a

1:04:27.230,1:04:34.160
couple of years ago but I sometimes do

1:04:31.010,1:04:36.770
tarot readings with Dane 11

1:04:34.160,1:04:39.710
Oh Dana's sister is a professional

1:04:36.770,1:04:44.930
clairvoyant and Dane is very good with

1:04:39.710,1:04:50.000
cards I trust her greatly and so we were

1:04:44.930,1:04:51.200
doing one I I guess I had done the cards

1:04:50.000,1:04:53.960
with Dana

1:04:51.200,1:04:56.180
but then Dana's sister Karen the

1:04:53.960,1:04:59.200
clairvoyant was visiting her so we had a

1:04:56.180,1:05:01.780
three-way conversation on my breath

1:04:59.200,1:05:05.890
they for birthday present about the

1:05:01.780,1:05:08.260
reading and Karen asked me questions

1:05:05.890,1:05:10.810
sort of the way a shrink does you know

1:05:08.260,1:05:15.070
leading questions she said you know what

1:05:10.810,1:05:18.640
is what have you you've been thinking

1:05:15.070,1:05:22.630
about it a nice writing and somehow it

1:05:18.640,1:05:25.510
came up then I I was very frightened by

1:05:22.630,1:05:28.119
this pleasure that I was taking in my

1:05:25.510,1:05:30.670
old work because I feared it meant I

1:05:28.119,1:05:34.839
would do no new work hmm

1:05:30.670,1:05:38.680
and Karen said I think you have to

1:05:34.839,1:05:40.570
embrace that I think that's she can use

1:05:38.680,1:05:43.089
words like path but you know that's

1:05:40.570,1:05:47.200
yours that's what you have to do you

1:05:43.089,1:05:50.050
like this you can't pretend that you're

1:05:47.200,1:05:52.920
not feeling it you just must follow that

1:05:50.050,1:05:56.800
feeling and see where it leads

1:05:52.920,1:06:00.700
so where it led was to a readiness to

1:05:56.800,1:06:03.880
see these books all put together which

1:06:00.700,1:06:06.490
had been proposed earlier in fact I was

1:06:03.880,1:06:08.980
contractually obliged to do it but I

1:06:06.490,1:06:10.690
would never have been press and there

1:06:08.980,1:06:13.599
was always the problem of the fact that

1:06:10.690,1:06:17.740
echo owned most of the books and Dan

1:06:13.599,1:06:20.290
helped her and resented for a very long

1:06:17.740,1:06:26.050
time possibly still continuing this

1:06:20.290,1:06:28.210
moment my switching publishers which I

1:06:26.050,1:06:31.920
did simply because his interest seemed

1:06:28.210,1:06:36.970
to be elsewhere so I I missed though I

1:06:31.920,1:06:39.700
missed the attention mm-hmm

1:06:36.970,1:06:42.280
in which book was that I mean did you

1:06:39.700,1:06:47.440
ever knowwwww ever know and it was the

1:06:42.280,1:06:48.380
very inflamed parting and for a long

1:06:47.440,1:06:50.720
time he would

1:06:48.380,1:06:53.059
relinquish any of the books to young so

1:06:50.720,1:06:55.009
none of that was possible but it was

1:06:53.059,1:06:59.239
fine because I didn't want it yeah

1:06:55.009,1:07:06.920
and then somehow or other that was all

1:06:59.239,1:07:16.069
negotiated and I did want it and I found

1:07:06.920,1:07:20.349
it invigorating and generally a very

1:07:16.069,1:07:23.599
pleasant thing and it made me feel I

1:07:20.349,1:07:27.430
didn't have to I didn't have to do a big

1:07:23.599,1:07:32.779
square thing anymore I could and

1:07:27.430,1:07:36.109
anything that I did was gravy and it and

1:07:32.779,1:07:39.220
I really like this new book it's not

1:07:36.109,1:07:42.410
like anything else I'm not done

1:07:39.220,1:07:45.460
it's sort of surreal it's got prose

1:07:42.410,1:07:49.400
poems in it mm-hmm

1:07:45.460,1:07:52.940
that's gonna be a shocker I think I

1:07:49.400,1:07:55.519
don't think people are gonna like it or

1:07:52.940,1:08:01.839
understand it like I I think of it as

1:07:55.519,1:08:07.729
very kind of light-hearted or it kind of

1:08:01.839,1:08:15.940
be the kind of well there's a lightness

1:08:07.729,1:08:19.880
in it a kind of casual shrugging bravado

1:08:15.940,1:08:22.040
like that I like it's not beautiful kind

1:08:19.880,1:08:23.139
of like like certainly though you're the

1:08:22.040,1:08:28.040
right yes

1:08:23.139,1:08:30.560
but a lot of people think it's

1:08:28.040,1:08:32.510
terrifying because you know a lot of it

1:08:30.560,1:08:36.900
is it

1:08:32.510,1:08:40.530
at the end of time but it's not written

1:08:36.900,1:08:44.030
as a struggle mm-hmm and it's not

1:08:40.530,1:08:49.530
written as capitulation it's written as

1:08:44.030,1:08:52.650
what do you know here we are yeah sort

1:08:49.530,1:08:55.859
of like that underneath a there's tones

1:08:52.650,1:09:00.870
in it that are not unlike when you do

1:08:55.859,1:09:05.160
don't know that kind of scratching your

1:09:00.870,1:09:08.520
head thing but but I kind of Mary Mary

1:09:05.160,1:09:11.910
bleakness yeah it's always a pleasurable

1:09:08.520,1:09:14.370
place to be yeah anyway so um did you

1:09:11.910,1:09:16.410
find in actually writing those poems

1:09:14.370,1:09:18.270
that there was a different way like

1:09:16.410,1:09:20.970
physically you were going after them or

1:09:18.270,1:09:22.920
anything else I mean it was it well the

1:09:20.970,1:09:25.170
last couple of books I've written a lot

1:09:22.920,1:09:27.120
of it longhand which was a great

1:09:25.170,1:09:31.050
surprise because everything up until

1:09:27.120,1:09:32.880
Averno was written on a typewriter I

1:09:31.050,1:09:35.850
love the composition including first

1:09:32.880,1:09:38.400
born no first formless by hand first

1:09:35.850,1:09:44.100
Remus Mahan and and everything from

1:09:38.400,1:09:46.589
marsh land caliber no it was composed on

1:09:44.100,1:09:49.490
a typewriter okay and it's one of the

1:09:46.589,1:09:53.550
reasons that my papers are not valuable

1:09:49.490,1:09:55.260
because people there's not everyone sort

1:09:53.550,1:09:57.870
of you know they'll be pages with little

1:09:55.260,1:09:59.850
scribbles but usually I just put in a

1:09:57.870,1:10:03.600
new piece so somebody who goes through

1:09:59.850,1:10:05.880
all of these typewritten drafts unless

1:10:03.600,1:10:09.960
they the person happens to know my work

1:10:05.880,1:10:13.650
intimately mm-hmm no they don't you know

1:10:09.960,1:10:20.150
it just looks like a lot of tight poems

1:10:13.650,1:10:20.150
you know authors hand a parent but

1:10:20.550,1:10:28.750
that wasn't well I don't know why I I

1:10:25.980,1:10:30.700
started keeping a journal when I had

1:10:28.750,1:10:33.400
whiplash and like someone said you

1:10:30.700,1:10:36.130
should start writing about what what it

1:10:33.400,1:10:38.590
feels like because you'll discover that

1:10:36.130,1:10:47.470
you're not in as much pain as you think

1:10:38.590,1:10:51.310
you are I started this notebook

1:10:47.470,1:10:58.210
recording my whiplash symptoms and the

1:10:51.310,1:11:01.020
agony that they entailed and so I it was

1:10:58.210,1:11:08.730
one of them I know stood in bed at night

1:11:01.020,1:11:11.620
reviewing my day and it became the most

1:11:08.730,1:11:13.420
crucial piece of my day and I'm

1:11:11.620,1:11:17.770
listening to the telephone weather

1:11:13.420,1:11:20.170
forecast which became village life no I

1:11:17.770,1:11:23.050
figured that out it took a long time but

1:11:20.170,1:11:24.850
so I would I would I would listen to the

1:11:23.050,1:11:27.940
weather forecast and when I would read

1:11:24.850,1:11:32.190
dial and listen to it again and there

1:11:27.940,1:11:32.190
was this wonderful voice that would say

1:11:33.150,1:11:39.460
good evening Boston and you would

1:11:37.540,1:11:40.600
realize that the same thing was going to

1:11:39.460,1:11:43.780
happen to everybody

1:11:40.600,1:11:47.830
you weren't just selected specially to

1:11:43.780,1:11:50.740
be rained on you know it was everyone

1:11:47.830,1:11:52.660
was going to have rain and it was the

1:11:50.740,1:11:55.000
first time I actually understood that

1:11:52.660,1:11:57.520
everything was going to everyone was

1:11:55.000,1:11:59.530
gonna have something you know I mean all

1:11:57.520,1:12:02.560
those times I stood in the drug aisles

1:11:59.530,1:12:04.570
of the supermarket thinking Louise they

1:12:02.560,1:12:07.720
can't have made all these products just

1:12:04.570,1:12:09.790
for you it must there must be a mark

1:12:07.720,1:12:11.170
someone else is buying these things and

1:12:09.790,1:12:14.050
then I would think yeah they're buying

1:12:11.170,1:12:18.330
them but they they only use half whereas

1:12:14.050,1:12:23.670
I need ten and anyway so but

1:12:18.330,1:12:26.100
whether it did make that knowledge

1:12:23.670,1:12:28.740
present and we while I was writing my

1:12:26.100,1:12:34.530
whiplash symptoms that's I would get in

1:12:28.740,1:12:38.390
a very Spacey place and so I started

1:12:34.530,1:12:42.750
making those four poems hmm and I would

1:12:38.390,1:12:45.170
so as not to interfere confuse things I

1:12:42.750,1:12:48.830
I did the poems in the back of the book

1:12:45.170,1:12:51.780
moving toward the middle mm-hmm and the

1:12:48.830,1:12:57.570
journal of my paint journal from the

1:12:51.780,1:13:00.600
front and I started you know yeah and

1:12:57.570,1:13:02.790
after the whiplash went away surprised

1:13:00.600,1:13:05.580
there were many other things to complain

1:13:02.790,1:13:12.980
about it really life so this week this

1:13:05.580,1:13:22.970
this sort of diary of grief complained

1:13:12.980,1:13:27.030
misery fear chronic anxiety occasional

1:13:22.970,1:13:30.390
nice things reported but mainly it was

1:13:27.030,1:13:37.160
the book was sacred to that mm-hmm and

1:13:30.390,1:13:41.960
it was a real it was a real source of

1:13:37.160,1:13:45.240
sweetness in my life I even when I

1:13:41.960,1:13:48.420
didn't have a bad day or I didn't have

1:13:45.240,1:13:51.150
any real pain or that wasn't sick I felt

1:13:48.420,1:13:54.630
that I owed it to the book - yes a the

1:13:51.150,1:13:56.820
worst so there would always be that yeah

1:13:54.630,1:13:59.040
and then there would be these notes and

1:13:56.820,1:14:02.790
so I have a whole bunch of these eerie

1:13:59.040,1:14:05.540
notebooks and then I I realized that

1:14:02.790,1:14:08.640
we're working kind of well and I liked

1:14:05.540,1:14:11.220
once I started working on a poem and I

1:14:08.640,1:14:14.510
would work on it the way I always had

1:14:11.220,1:14:17.690
mm-hmm only a lot of it was longhand

1:14:14.510,1:14:22.670
look at and the lines were getting

1:14:17.690,1:14:24.380
different shaped and and the advantage

1:14:22.670,1:14:28.010
of that was I could also do it when I

1:14:24.380,1:14:33.530
was commuting you know I had a car

1:14:28.010,1:14:36.920
service in those years and Averno was

1:14:33.530,1:14:38.450
the first thing I did when I was at Yale

1:14:36.920,1:14:41.360
mm-hmm

1:14:38.450,1:14:45.320
and I remember working on the poems in

1:14:41.360,1:14:48.140
the car and then I would transcribe that

1:14:45.320,1:14:50.030
into the notebook in the back mm-hmm and

1:14:48.140,1:14:53.480
at a certain point each one would have

1:14:50.030,1:14:55.400
to be there'd be enough material so I

1:14:53.480,1:15:02.030
had to play that on the typewriter and

1:14:55.400,1:15:04.370
see how it looked in type and one fact

1:15:02.030,1:15:06.350
of working on a typewriter that's either

1:15:04.370,1:15:09.340
I don't know whether it's an advantage

1:15:06.350,1:15:12.770
or not I imagined for pros it would be

1:15:09.340,1:15:19.180
my pros Reuter friends all love the

1:15:12.770,1:15:24.050
computer yet when I get to an impasse or

1:15:19.180,1:15:26.390
an awkward line I start have to start

1:15:24.050,1:15:29.390
over so it's a new sheet of paper and

1:15:26.390,1:15:34.520
you have to do the whole thing again and

1:15:29.390,1:15:36.410
so problems emerge in those retyping is

1:15:34.520,1:15:38.720
like your your fingers will hesitate

1:15:36.410,1:15:41.360
over something you thought was resolved

1:15:38.720,1:15:45.620
and you realize it's not resolved you

1:15:41.360,1:15:46.910
realize you have to do something

1:15:45.620,1:15:48.950
different mm-hmm

1:15:46.910,1:15:50.630
so you had those you were you were kind

1:15:48.950,1:15:52.490
of making those revisions in in the

1:15:50.630,1:15:54.620
actual transcription work so yeah I mean

1:15:52.490,1:15:56.180
to you yeah just from some sort of

1:15:54.620,1:16:00.380
almost like a almost like a like a

1:15:56.180,1:16:02.030
practiced feel of the yeah your hands

1:16:00.380,1:16:04.040
wouldn't type it yes

1:16:02.030,1:16:05.810
realize something was wrong either the

1:16:04.040,1:16:08.210
line was wrong in

1:16:05.810,1:16:12.380
was lineatus which would be simpler to

1:16:08.210,1:16:17.210
resolve more the whole trajectory of the

1:16:12.380,1:16:19.310
palm was awry yeah that was and then

1:16:17.210,1:16:20.990
you'd have to go back and do more we're

1:16:19.310,1:16:22.550
going to at that point would you do more

1:16:20.990,1:16:24.050
work in the notebook before you went

1:16:22.550,1:16:26.930
back to the typewriter or once you think

1:16:24.050,1:16:28.190
then I started working on that then what

1:16:26.930,1:16:29.840
would happen would be I'd have these

1:16:28.190,1:16:34.280
typewriter sheets and I would start

1:16:29.840,1:16:37.310
working 200 in the same timeframe mmm

1:16:34.280,1:16:40.220
okay you're back and forth yeah and then

1:16:37.310,1:16:42.710
how do these just cancel the weather

1:16:40.220,1:16:46.100
report by the way no those are the I'm

1:16:42.710,1:16:48.920
the presence of that absolutely yeah

1:16:46.100,1:16:49.670
where's the bathroom I have to go feed

1:16:48.920,1:16:54.620
the meter

1:16:49.670,1:17:00.980

1:17:06.500,1:17:13.720
the permit parking yeah yeah just put it

1:17:11.570,1:17:13.720
on

1:17:16.730,1:17:25.399
[Music]

1:17:41.740,1:17:44.899
[Applause]

1:17:56.560,1:18:00.520
were there any other things like the

1:17:58.540,1:18:02.800
like the weather report for any other

1:18:00.520,1:18:06.600
books I mean did that ever happen before

1:18:02.800,1:18:09.400
were there any sort of other I mean I

1:18:06.600,1:18:11.800
know other books had like something

1:18:09.400,1:18:13.360
where like a ritual to which you were

1:18:11.800,1:18:16.930
responding in some sense

1:18:13.360,1:18:19.510
well wild iris was a garden yeah I had

1:18:16.930,1:18:22.930
been reading garden catalogs for tree up

1:18:19.510,1:18:25.950
two years of writing nothing yeah all I

1:18:22.930,1:18:28.810
had where it was garden catalogs and

1:18:25.950,1:18:31.300
plus I'd seen when I first moved to

1:18:28.810,1:18:33.790
Vermont to clarify and who told me I

1:18:31.300,1:18:37.330
would write five books and I've written

1:18:33.790,1:18:40.390
five that was the fifth oh and I thought

1:18:37.330,1:18:43.150
that's it and I thought it's obvious

1:18:40.390,1:18:46.870
because there's no beauty in Ararat it's

1:18:43.150,1:18:49.970
just the whole weird gift is dribbling

1:18:46.870,1:18:52.700
away and then

1:18:49.970,1:18:56.570
I read garden catalogs and listening to

1:18:52.700,1:18:58.370
the Don Giovanni for two years and I

1:18:56.570,1:19:04.850
thought I'm brain dead you know of

1:18:58.370,1:19:09.650
course I can't right yeah and and then

1:19:04.850,1:19:12.680
that that came in a burst yeah no it was

1:19:09.650,1:19:15.770
um it was summer Oh summer okay I

1:19:12.680,1:19:23.810
started walking around the garden which

1:19:15.770,1:19:29.210
had been the only thing that I did yeah

1:19:23.810,1:19:32.330
and um and things were coming out of the

1:19:29.210,1:19:37.910
ground and I thought I might try and

1:19:32.330,1:19:40.340
write something about yeah flower so in

1:19:37.910,1:19:42.640
terms of like so the difference then I

1:19:40.340,1:19:44.390
mean now we kind of have an idea of the

1:19:42.640,1:19:45.980
handwriting to the typewriter and

1:19:44.390,1:19:47.840
whatnot I mean what was it like when you

1:19:45.980,1:19:49.250
were just type writing your poems I mean

1:19:47.840,1:19:51.050
you would you you'd sit down at your

1:19:49.250,1:19:52.910
desk or wherever I mean the typewriters

1:19:51.050,1:19:55.430
are kind of really things you'd have to

1:19:52.910,1:20:00.110
be in one place wherever you were you

1:19:55.430,1:20:03.260
know they would always be it would be

1:20:00.110,1:20:06.170
episodic okay um and didn't have to be

1:20:03.260,1:20:11.300
my typewriter for example I remember

1:20:06.170,1:20:14.690
when I was working on what was it seven

1:20:11.300,1:20:17.060
ages Vita Nova mm-hmm I remember writing

1:20:14.690,1:20:20.300
some of those poems on an airplane I

1:20:17.060,1:20:24.830
wrote two on one transcontinental flight

1:20:20.300,1:20:27.680
and then I got to a vine and I had to

1:20:24.830,1:20:30.950
borrow a typewriter but that was

1:20:27.680,1:20:32.510
possible yeah and then I had to work it

1:20:30.950,1:20:35.700
out tie

1:20:32.510,1:20:39.270
so there were things that were but I was

1:20:35.700,1:20:41.790
at that particular point I was really on

1:20:39.270,1:20:44.550
a roll I mean I knew who's from

1:20:41.790,1:20:49.680
everything was turning into a Paula yeah

1:20:44.550,1:20:51.360
so I felt I could be anywhere and I

1:20:49.680,1:20:53.640
could write with anything and I could

1:20:51.360,1:20:57.750
write with you know food colouring

1:20:53.640,1:21:03.630
charcoal and I could I could make

1:20:57.750,1:21:06.300
actually very crude like powerpoints and

1:21:03.630,1:21:08.130
I would know how to assemble a oh that's

1:21:06.300,1:21:10.200
fine so when you're in that sort of

1:21:08.130,1:21:11.580
stage where are these are they just

1:21:10.200,1:21:13.740
coming to you are they coming from

1:21:11.580,1:21:15.420
overheard statements or is it it's all

1:21:13.740,1:21:18.360
just there and you're just kind of

1:21:15.420,1:21:21.500
waiting to release it I

1:21:18.360,1:21:24.450
it's nothing overheard it's some weird

1:21:21.500,1:21:28.710
brain corner that totally you have

1:21:24.450,1:21:32.370
access to and it exists it's like a

1:21:28.710,1:21:35.910
temporary shelter exists for a very

1:21:32.370,1:21:38.760
short time and it's not like you think I

1:21:35.910,1:21:41.460
could go back there you just think yeah

1:21:38.760,1:21:43.170
do you see any patterns now that you've

1:21:41.460,1:21:46.980
had these experiences happen to get him

1:21:43.170,1:21:48.720
again that that sort of anticipate your

1:21:46.980,1:21:51.770
getting to where that brain corner opens

1:21:48.720,1:21:56.700
up or is it's no I am I'm always curious

1:21:51.770,1:22:00.840
so he's mysterious and the last two

1:21:56.700,1:22:08.240
books have been a little slower in what

1:22:00.840,1:22:11.310
I felt was a a good way because the

1:22:08.240,1:22:15.480
stamina called for and that other kind

1:22:11.310,1:22:20.400
of composition is so extreme plus you

1:22:15.480,1:22:23.760
don't get that you don't get a very

1:22:20.400,1:22:26.460
prolonged experience of immersion you

1:22:23.760,1:22:34.710
know you get a very intense fast hit

1:22:26.460,1:22:35.249
yeah but I really liked the feeling that

1:22:34.710,1:22:37.019
I had

1:22:35.249,1:22:39.510
it was like writing a novel that I

1:22:37.019,1:22:43.400
hadn't put in in village life I had this

1:22:39.510,1:22:51.150
sound to go to that was like a place and

1:22:43.400,1:22:57.179
it was accessible I could get there it

1:22:51.150,1:23:00.900
wasn't like this special trick pony you

1:22:57.179,1:23:03.869
know it was yeah and it would it meant

1:23:00.900,1:23:06.269
that the composition was a year and

1:23:03.869,1:23:09.539
stunt which still seems pretty fast yes

1:23:06.269,1:23:11.789
but it's not as fast as six weeks yeah

1:23:09.539,1:23:13.559
absolutely that was we didn't know that

1:23:11.789,1:23:18.929
that was the best six weeks who's the

1:23:13.559,1:23:23.219
fastest how long was about iris uh more

1:23:18.929,1:23:26.630
like nine weeks but there were three

1:23:23.219,1:23:31.860
poems that were written the year before

1:23:26.630,1:23:34.860
they just were crap but once I wrote the

1:23:31.860,1:23:39.150
wild iris I once I wrote the bulk of

1:23:34.860,1:23:41.940
that book I knew where the the crappy

1:23:39.150,1:23:44.579
poems didn't seem so crappy okay and one

1:23:41.940,1:23:47.969
of them did you know it was a blanks and

1:23:44.579,1:23:49.769
David and Meredith's daughter mm-hmm did

1:23:47.969,1:23:52.440
you know David and Meredith at all no

1:23:49.769,1:23:54.960
take a classics class well she's my

1:23:52.440,1:23:59.130
godchild and she was at that point very

1:23:54.960,1:24:01.590
little and this was the period in which

1:23:59.130,1:24:05.309
I was writing nothing and I I said

1:24:01.590,1:24:10.530
Elizabeth give me the title give me a

1:24:05.309,1:24:15.210
title or a first line and I thought I if

1:24:10.530,1:24:16.470
Elizabeth asked me to write a poem I'll

1:24:15.210,1:24:23.310
have to do

1:24:16.470,1:24:29.970
yeah and she did and I it got used what

1:24:23.310,1:24:33.180
was like red rose on a lowly vine it

1:24:29.970,1:24:36.030
didn't get called that finely but you

1:24:33.180,1:24:40.230
know it was a little song like Valentine

1:24:36.030,1:24:42.180
of a poem yeah but but then I mean if it

1:24:40.230,1:24:46.230
if it looks do you like that's your

1:24:42.180,1:24:47.160
that's your output for two years okay

1:24:46.230,1:24:50.040
dad

1:24:47.160,1:24:53.340
yeah but you know I had a place in that

1:24:50.040,1:24:56.940
book yeah so that was so in the name

1:24:53.340,1:25:01.350
while iris was the first book I wrote

1:24:56.940,1:25:03.900
fast but it had had these three weeka

1:25:01.350,1:25:10.920
SHhhh poems that can absorb into it

1:25:03.900,1:25:15.990
mm-hmm so I don't know I don't know if

1:25:10.920,1:25:19.760
what will happen now I imagine all the

1:25:15.990,1:25:19.760
sand into some of this

1:25:22.190,1:25:28.110
and you know this is just a question you

1:25:26.070,1:25:33.980
know how much more you get to do you're

1:25:28.110,1:25:37.310
fine I'm still feeling surprisingly

1:25:33.980,1:25:39.360
happy with my last one and I know that

1:25:37.310,1:25:41.400
until I hate it

1:25:39.360,1:25:46.710
nothing's gonna happen how long have you

1:25:41.400,1:25:50.280
been finished with it it'll be a year in

1:25:46.710,1:25:52.219
September so it's still a baby how do

1:25:50.280,1:25:55.469
you know I mean you you have a kind of

1:25:52.219,1:25:56.670
really final sense of finality for these

1:25:55.469,1:25:58.650
things and then I guess like I'm

1:25:56.670,1:26:00.929
interested in how you do you have like

1:25:58.650,1:26:02.969
just like a physical sensation when that

1:26:00.929,1:26:05.280
happens or is it your brain stops moving

1:26:02.969,1:26:07.440
in that direction and it's so you can

1:26:05.280,1:26:09.540
sometimes have that but it isn't

1:26:07.440,1:26:12.389
finished okay

1:26:09.540,1:26:14.670
I mean that's happened to me a number of

1:26:12.389,1:26:17.159
times they're usually always means that

1:26:14.670,1:26:18.440
there's something that isn't written yet

1:26:17.159,1:26:21.480
hmm

1:26:18.440,1:26:23.969
even though you just cannot imagine what

1:26:21.480,1:26:28.580
it is and the meadowlands was like that

1:26:23.969,1:26:28.580
I just I thought

1:26:31.600,1:26:36.890
but it was clear I might be good at

1:26:34.790,1:26:40.250
putting books together and I can figure

1:26:36.890,1:26:41.870
out what each body of work seems to need

1:26:40.250,1:26:46.100
and there was no way to put that

1:26:41.870,1:26:50.020
together and someone was missing and I

1:26:46.100,1:26:53.150
thought it was probably some more

1:26:50.020,1:26:56.239
sonorous column but it wasn't that it

1:26:53.150,1:27:00.050
was Telemachus was missing oh okay and I

1:26:56.239,1:27:02.480
wrote those poems in I think 10 days and

1:27:00.050,1:27:04.340
maybe from and then it's a breeze

1:27:02.480,1:27:06.620
you know I'll think about you know King

1:27:04.340,1:27:09.980
you know into place I think that's I

1:27:06.620,1:27:11.660
like I've just been eyeing that book too

1:27:09.980,1:27:14.270
yeah that's very funny

1:27:11.660,1:27:19.070
that's very funny I know I think it's a

1:27:14.270,1:27:23.720
I think it's a screen yeah but um and I

1:27:19.070,1:27:26.810
like that I mean I like I like tunnel

1:27:23.720,1:27:32.930
variety yeah a lot and I like it and

1:27:26.810,1:27:36.860
what I read but I think sometimes this

1:27:32.930,1:27:39.260
you know the last two books I drove

1:27:36.860,1:27:43.850
people crazy with village life because I

1:27:39.260,1:27:46.940
had maybe 400 different orders and they

1:27:43.850,1:27:48.590
were all not right um yeah that would be

1:27:46.940,1:27:51.710
that I could see that book being

1:27:48.590,1:27:53.870
difficult to put together I knew how I

1:27:51.710,1:27:59.090
knew where I wanted to start anew where

1:27:53.870,1:28:01.520
I want and even in between and I think

1:27:59.090,1:28:03.980
it was on that or two of something

1:28:01.520,1:28:06.590
happening to divide it how did you learn

1:28:03.980,1:28:07.880
how did I mean did you learn how to put

1:28:06.590,1:28:09.350
together books like this I mean like

1:28:07.880,1:28:11.150
what was the what was the sort of

1:28:09.350,1:28:16.610
education your own your education in

1:28:11.150,1:28:19.510
that sense each book learned from the

1:28:16.610,1:28:24.440
material and I think I've learned from

1:28:19.510,1:28:28.489
students - okay I I think that that I'm

1:28:24.440,1:28:29.579
a very good editor yeah and I was felt

1:28:28.489,1:28:34.320
it

1:28:29.579,1:28:37.769
I had stuff on a page I would have some

1:28:34.320,1:28:39.689
good instincts about I mean if there was

1:28:37.769,1:28:42.889
anything to be gotten out of that

1:28:39.689,1:28:47.519
material I would find it mm-hmm

1:28:42.889,1:28:56.399
so a sort of sense of being able to put

1:28:47.519,1:29:00.119
to use the most pathetic limited samples

1:28:56.399,1:29:02.999
of language but if you just give me some

1:29:00.119,1:29:05.939
words doesn't matter how bad they are I

1:29:02.999,1:29:10.260
can do something yeah I felt the same

1:29:05.939,1:29:13.979
about manuscripts I thought if there's

1:29:10.260,1:29:14.939
if there's a way to put it together I'll

1:29:13.979,1:29:19.199
find it

1:29:14.939,1:29:20.039
mm-hmm my own books and other people's

1:29:19.199,1:29:23.280
books too

1:29:20.039,1:29:25.679
I mean in the way I'm I mean I'm sure i

1:29:23.280,1:29:27.809
drive some people crazy because I just

1:29:25.679,1:29:31.499
look at their manuscripts and I say no

1:29:27.809,1:29:34.649
he's leaving all to me you're doing this

1:29:31.499,1:29:38.570
terribly and I was that kind of a mother

1:29:34.649,1:29:41.489
you know they say don't feed yourself

1:29:38.570,1:29:42.269
really you know just don't know how to

1:29:41.489,1:29:47.300
do it

1:29:42.269,1:29:53.280
the Gees you said I'll feed you you know

1:29:47.300,1:29:57.209
and I people people don't like that and

1:29:53.280,1:29:59.669
it's also possible that that that one

1:29:57.209,1:30:04.589
could be wrong or or that there could be

1:29:59.669,1:30:11.579
something something I missed

1:30:04.589,1:30:14.280
mm-hmm but I think it was it was always

1:30:11.579,1:30:17.280
it was a think something that you learn

1:30:14.280,1:30:21.570
when you write very slowly so you don't

1:30:17.280,1:30:27.119
have a huge outpouring you know the

1:30:21.570,1:30:30.149
small amount then you have to make

1:30:27.119,1:30:31.290
though as far as you can hmm and so you

1:30:30.149,1:30:34.200
learn how

1:30:31.290,1:30:37.680
to move the parts of a poem around you

1:30:34.200,1:30:43.830
move you learn you learn how to be an

1:30:37.680,1:30:49.520
editor out of a sense of lack yeah

1:30:43.830,1:30:52.350
and from that gross capacity to organize

1:30:49.520,1:30:57.630
disparate things into something that has

1:30:52.350,1:30:59.790
a sense of dramatic shape it is that

1:30:57.630,1:31:02.280
that sort of a sense of dramatic shape

1:30:59.790,1:31:05.250
is that your intention for most of your

1:31:02.280,1:31:06.990
collection even I want the books to seem

1:31:05.250,1:31:09.300
like that but it's not as though when

1:31:06.990,1:31:13.200
I'm working on them I know what it is

1:31:09.300,1:31:16.950
yeah I pretty much don't when do you get

1:31:13.200,1:31:18.960
that sense well I'm starting to put it

1:31:16.950,1:31:20.640
when you're starting to see them all

1:31:18.960,1:31:27.930
together and you start seeing these

1:31:20.640,1:31:35.810
weird overlaps and resonances and echoes

1:31:27.930,1:31:41.540
that you hadn't planned yeah I mean

1:31:35.810,1:31:45.210
proofing this my new book I I see these

1:31:41.540,1:31:48.810
strangest parallels and language

1:31:45.210,1:31:50.700
language recurrences that I mean you

1:31:48.810,1:31:56.490
could say yes you have a limited

1:31:50.700,1:32:01.850
vocabulary these words that you use yes

1:31:56.490,1:32:06.150
you still remember them but it's also

1:32:01.850,1:32:10.020
then it's like dreams you know the mind

1:32:06.150,1:32:15.890
is is somehow the mind is making an

1:32:10.020,1:32:15.890
organization that is beyond what what

1:32:16.670,1:32:29.900
be comprehending or apprehending

1:32:21.550,1:32:32.000
faculties take in initially when you're

1:32:29.900,1:32:33.230
when you're working the living so when

1:32:32.000,1:32:34.490
you're working just on an individual

1:32:33.230,1:32:36.740
poem when you're revising it what's

1:32:34.490,1:32:38.810
what's like the mode there and you're

1:32:36.740,1:32:41.450
going back are you just deleting are you

1:32:38.810,1:32:42.770
substituting or is their primary or just

1:32:41.450,1:32:46.240
whatever you whatever the palm needs

1:32:42.770,1:32:52.880
you're having service to it yeah yeah

1:32:46.240,1:32:55.460
aim I mean nothing's more if I can tell

1:32:52.880,1:32:58.310
myself that a poem can't be made with

1:32:55.460,1:33:00.650
just the leading things that's great

1:32:58.310,1:33:02.450
yeah that's two for the price of one you

1:33:00.650,1:33:04.730
get the deleted lines if they're any

1:33:02.450,1:33:08.720
good to you somewhere else yeah and you

1:33:04.730,1:33:14.960
get a poem but oftentimes you can't just

1:33:08.720,1:33:19.240
delete often so sometimes you can take

1:33:14.960,1:33:23.090
out everything that's weak and

1:33:19.240,1:33:29.330
transitions that are obvious but what

1:33:23.090,1:33:33.880
you then rekt is the feeling of duration

1:33:29.330,1:33:38.200
the poem has become too brisk mmm and

1:33:33.880,1:33:42.950
needs to have a feeling of moral

1:33:38.200,1:33:45.050
languorous unfolding so then that's a

1:33:42.950,1:33:48.650
problem because you don't know whether

1:33:45.050,1:33:49.920
you're supposed to and and the place is

1:33:48.650,1:33:54.090
where you had

1:33:49.920,1:33:59.310
before or were they the wrong places was

1:33:54.090,1:34:05.310
that part of the problem but each poem

1:33:59.310,1:34:08.250
is its own little task you just you know

1:34:05.310,1:34:11.960
for a long time it's a it's a problem

1:34:08.250,1:34:17.250
you haven't solved and then it becomes

1:34:11.960,1:34:18.990
something that you have solved yeah and

1:34:17.250,1:34:21.150
is it the same thing I mean is it the

1:34:18.990,1:34:22.440
same feeling of finality that you have

1:34:21.150,1:34:24.210
with the collection that you have with

1:34:22.440,1:34:26.160
an individual poem I mean that there's

1:34:24.210,1:34:29.790
if there's nothing more to be done sort

1:34:26.160,1:34:32.100
of yeah well but also that it gives you

1:34:29.790,1:34:36.600
pleasure yeah you like the shape that it

1:34:32.100,1:34:39.870
makes yeah and you like it better than

1:34:36.600,1:34:41.820
you've gotten ever could you know so all

1:34:39.870,1:34:44.190
these poems you just thought were so

1:34:41.820,1:34:50.160
cumbersome and there was no way that

1:34:44.190,1:34:53.370
they could be organized that we just

1:34:50.160,1:34:59.610
didn't see it yeah suddenly you actually

1:34:53.370,1:35:01.200
like them again well has that has your

1:34:59.610,1:35:03.360
mode of revision has that changed it all

1:35:01.200,1:35:06.150
over the course or has it been fairly

1:35:03.360,1:35:13.320
consistent I'm sure it's quite different

1:35:06.150,1:35:14.369
yeah but I yeah I mean the poems are so

1:35:13.320,1:35:16.020
different that

1:35:14.369,1:35:17.550
there must be that the approach is

1:35:16.020,1:35:22.340
different right

1:35:17.550,1:35:26.159
I mean now I'm much more like

1:35:22.340,1:35:35.389
approximation I like a sense in in the

1:35:26.159,1:35:40.710
poem of not the sort of Holland perfect

1:35:35.389,1:35:45.869
formal you know the epigrammatic mm-hmm

1:35:40.710,1:35:50.420
I want more the kind of that kind of the

1:35:45.869,1:35:50.420
kind of speech okay

1:35:53.640,1:36:02.060
the sense of casting about for a phrase

1:35:57.000,1:36:02.060
I like that feeling mm-hmm

1:36:06.710,1:36:18.080
human sounding ruminative rather than

1:36:14.739,1:36:20.989
exalted but you know I think of a ver

1:36:18.080,1:36:23.030
Noah's the books always seems to me I've

1:36:20.989,1:36:27.530
said this a million times this is

1:36:23.030,1:36:30.739
probably on there already so maybe these

1:36:27.530,1:36:34.540
books seem vertical and some of them

1:36:30.739,1:36:34.540
seem horizontal hmm

1:36:35.530,1:36:43.909
usually they alternate so they'll be a

1:36:39.130,1:36:49.820
kind of odd to despair or book followed

1:36:43.909,1:36:52.610
by panoramic book but the last two both

1:36:49.820,1:36:54.800
seem to me kind of spreading

1:36:52.610,1:37:04.730
though they're very different you know

1:36:54.800,1:37:08.210
each other how many people are you gonna

1:37:04.730,1:37:09.170
do this with ten Jesus you'll be out of

1:37:08.210,1:37:12.110
your mind

1:37:09.170,1:37:16.790
I know it's okay let's see I guess

1:37:12.110,1:37:20.140
you're number seven eight oh you've done

1:37:16.790,1:37:22.400
a lot yeah yeah I've done quite a few

1:37:20.140,1:37:24.440
does everyone out there Frank

1:37:22.400,1:37:26.630
yes it's very interesting what people

1:37:24.440,1:37:28.130
want to talk about and people who I've

1:37:26.630,1:37:30.320
done people who know me who don't know

1:37:28.130,1:37:31.699
me and so there's some wariness and then

1:37:30.320,1:37:32.960
there's some sometimes there's not and

1:37:31.699,1:37:35.270
sometimes people who know me are wary of

1:37:32.960,1:37:37.400
the questions more and this you I mean

1:37:35.270,1:37:39.620
honestly the questions haven't really

1:37:37.400,1:37:41.510
but I mean you've answered them without

1:37:39.620,1:37:48.710
my asking them so that's that's been

1:37:41.510,1:37:52.090
that's good it's a good sign no no yeah

1:37:48.710,1:37:55.130
I think there's I think there's plenty

1:37:52.090,1:37:56.780
the I didn't like so when you're

1:37:55.130,1:37:59.120
revising are you reading them out loud

1:37:56.780,1:38:00.469
to yourself this isn't is this is that

1:37:59.120,1:38:01.560
something as part of your practice I

1:38:00.469,1:38:05.520
know for some of the other writers

1:38:01.560,1:38:10.140
husband I I keep I keep trying to make

1:38:05.520,1:38:13.800
this point in poetry readings I I hear

1:38:10.140,1:38:17.250
with my eyes I I mean the experience of

1:38:13.800,1:38:20.910
reading a poem for me with my own eyes

1:38:17.250,1:38:29.760
mm-hmm contains an aural experience yeah

1:38:20.910,1:38:33.240
and when I hear it I feel angry and I

1:38:29.760,1:38:36.540
feel that there's an obstacle between me

1:38:33.240,1:38:39.800
and the it of the poem the obstacle is

1:38:36.540,1:38:46.470
the reader who is determining and

1:38:39.800,1:38:51.470
deploying emphasis and also the form

1:38:46.470,1:38:56.730
which is turning a kind of web-like

1:38:51.470,1:39:03.750
experience into a narrative everything

1:38:56.730,1:39:05.970
goes by once yeah and I I hear and the

1:39:03.750,1:39:09.270
argument made is yes but then you can't

1:39:05.970,1:39:12.300
hear it but I don't hear it when it's

1:39:09.270,1:39:13.050
read to me yeah and I don't mutter it to

1:39:12.300,1:39:16.230
myself

1:39:13.050,1:39:20.310
I hear it in my head though and I hum it

1:39:16.230,1:39:22.170
in my head hmm I mean I can hear you can

1:39:20.310,1:39:25.530
hear like almost like musical notes or

1:39:22.170,1:39:29.760
tones - I can hear rhythmic structures I

1:39:25.530,1:39:32.910
remember with meadowlands I had this

1:39:29.760,1:39:36.660
sense of the book it was the only time I

1:39:32.910,1:39:39.090
had this I had a whole I felt I had the

1:39:36.660,1:39:42.500
whole book in my head I just didn't have

1:39:39.090,1:39:49.100
a single word yeah but what I had was

1:39:42.500,1:39:49.100
really make Ultem alternations I

1:39:50.869,1:39:58.190
shapes that were clustered and dense and

1:39:54.860,1:39:59.809
more open shapes and it was almost as

1:39:58.190,1:40:02.380
though there were there was a musical

1:39:59.809,1:40:06.829
line and I would hear the you know

1:40:02.380,1:40:13.059
rising and falling I would hear Karl

1:40:06.829,1:40:15.710
parts and I I felt even tried to

1:40:13.059,1:40:18.889
annotate it in some way so that I could

1:40:15.710,1:40:24.650
follow it but it was like a hum yeah it

1:40:18.889,1:40:27.889
was like someone was one I heard

1:40:24.650,1:40:31.070
somebody say I think they're of some

1:40:27.889,1:40:35.420
kind not a poet something about the way

1:40:31.070,1:40:40.309
a child learns speech lying in its

1:40:35.420,1:40:45.590
cradle and hearing the shapes of this

1:40:40.309,1:40:48.469
the shapes made by it by the speechless

1:40:45.590,1:40:53.389
surrounds it and it doesn't understand

1:40:48.469,1:40:56.269
words yet but it understands and for me

1:40:53.389,1:40:58.280
poems have been like that I mean I

1:40:56.269,1:41:02.030
remember reading when I was really

1:40:58.280,1:41:06.440
really young reading not baby poems but

1:41:02.030,1:41:10.519
great poems Jim Spears songs and I had

1:41:06.440,1:41:14.780
I'm sure no idea what was being told of

1:41:10.519,1:41:17.300
her none but I felt like I thought I was

1:41:14.780,1:41:22.519
getting something out of those poems I

1:41:17.300,1:41:24.619
could hear I could hear the fear no more

1:41:22.519,1:41:27.999
in the heat of the Sun I could hear the

1:41:24.619,1:41:27.999
grandeur of that

1:41:31.400,1:41:37.610
that the rhythm I mean somebody could

1:41:35.120,1:41:43.120
turn it into an active scanning the line

1:41:37.610,1:41:43.120
but it it that makes it so kind of

1:41:43.750,1:41:51.050
plotting yeah but you do

1:41:46.490,1:41:56.720
I did hear things yeah that way but with

1:41:51.050,1:42:00.190
my eyes I mean my eyes make I turn what

1:41:56.720,1:42:03.800
I see not into all my argument or a

1:42:00.190,1:42:08.570
reasoned thing yeah a lot of that stuff

1:42:03.800,1:42:13.280
I miss what is the poem saying I often

1:42:08.570,1:42:13.970
don't I have no idea but I know how it

1:42:13.280,1:42:16.490
sounds

1:42:13.970,1:42:18.320
yeah that's its own sort of yeah

1:42:16.490,1:42:19.820
intelligent communication to or any

1:42:18.320,1:42:23.600
means yeah that's it no that's that's

1:42:19.820,1:42:25.520
really fascinating well I'm sure there

1:42:23.600,1:42:30.800
must be a lot of people who write who

1:42:25.520,1:42:33.470
have this feel that they're yeah no I

1:42:30.800,1:42:36.740
think the own sound comes to them

1:42:33.470,1:42:38.480
visually well it's like I'm in some

1:42:36.740,1:42:40.340
sense these it right I mean it yeah it's

1:42:38.480,1:42:42.470
close to that sort of description but

1:42:40.340,1:42:44.410
it's not that quite really yeah but it's

1:42:42.470,1:42:49.130
an interesting correlation um

1:42:44.410,1:42:51.080
due to people I know you you work with

1:42:49.130,1:42:53.180
with fellow poets on your poems correct

1:42:51.080,1:42:55.520
I mean you're sending stuff to to you

1:42:53.180,1:42:57.530
certain readers etc do you work on

1:42:55.520,1:43:00.380
individual poems of individual times or

1:42:57.530,1:43:03.170
is it usually in a collection everything

1:43:00.380,1:43:05.300
I write goes out goes out okay and how

1:43:03.170,1:43:08.360
does I want someone to look at it yeah

1:43:05.300,1:43:10.700
preferably right away yeah how who are

1:43:08.360,1:43:12.770
those people where they have them in the

1:43:10.700,1:43:15.820
same people for a long time or they just

1:43:12.770,1:43:19.960
changed from a change I mean is um

1:43:15.820,1:43:24.710
certain periods certain people mm-hmm

1:43:19.960,1:43:26.780
sometimes you'll feel somebody is the

1:43:24.710,1:43:28.250
book you feel is really these poems if

1:43:26.780,1:43:28.820
they're ever gonna be understood by

1:43:28.250,1:43:32.630
anyone

1:43:28.820,1:43:36.500
we'll be understood by X yeah and you're

1:43:32.630,1:43:40.370
usually right and then you get when when

1:43:36.500,1:43:42.500
X says this won't do you trust it

1:43:40.370,1:43:43.700
because the person is basically on the

1:43:42.500,1:43:45.410
side of the work

1:43:43.700,1:43:48.890
yeah whereas if you show it to somebody

1:43:45.410,1:43:53.090
who from the outset says it's just a

1:43:48.890,1:43:55.640
disaster it's not gonna be if the book

1:43:53.090,1:43:58.040
is classic a you know it's too late to

1:43:55.640,1:44:00.290
unwrite it we're gonna get written and

1:43:58.040,1:44:05.900
you could then suppress it if you wanted

1:44:00.290,1:44:08.860
but yeah so it's it's shifted I mean

1:44:05.900,1:44:12.140
there's certain people who have been

1:44:08.860,1:44:14.680
constant for a very long time Kathy

1:44:12.140,1:44:23.080
Davis mm-hmm

1:44:14.680,1:44:28.550
she has been stratospherically helpful

1:44:23.080,1:44:32.720
and and I like working on her novels and

1:44:28.550,1:44:34.370
I learn a lot from working on prose what

1:44:32.720,1:44:41.450
do you I mean what have you learned

1:44:34.370,1:44:43.100
or do you learn you learn moving around

1:44:41.450,1:44:44.900
much bigger pieces

1:44:43.100,1:44:46.280
I mean Kathy's folks it's not so much a

1:44:44.900,1:44:48.860
question of that but there have been

1:44:46.280,1:44:52.610
books where I felt there's too many

1:44:48.860,1:44:59.420
characters and such and such these two

1:44:52.610,1:45:01.340
could be translated and other times I

1:44:59.420,1:45:04.490
think I felt things were in the wrong

1:45:01.340,1:45:08.180
order or that too much time was spent on

1:45:04.490,1:45:11.060
the particular thing but with my former

1:45:08.180,1:45:14.500
husband who was a quite terrific prose

1:45:11.060,1:45:19.330
writer it was often the question of

1:45:14.500,1:45:21.530
really moving around blocks of prose hmm

1:45:19.330,1:45:24.440
the way you would do in a poem

1:45:21.530,1:45:28.340
you'd move a line in a poem but in prose

1:45:24.440,1:45:34.849
you would move a paragraph

1:45:28.340,1:45:37.250
and I thought so I learned it's like

1:45:34.849,1:45:40.760
weight training like that goodness I

1:45:37.250,1:45:42.739
could move bigger masses and it was very

1:45:40.760,1:45:45.949
useful you know I don't think I would

1:45:42.739,1:45:48.409
have written Ararat without that and I

1:45:45.949,1:45:53.349
think if I hadn't written Ararat I

1:45:48.409,1:46:00.860
wouldn't I would stalled out as uh yeah

1:45:53.349,1:46:04.310
certain kind of lyric poet right well uh

1:46:00.860,1:46:06.380
I have some questions about why you

1:46:04.310,1:46:06.920
chose not to write a computer to use a

1:46:06.380,1:46:11.719
computer

1:46:06.920,1:46:14.719
I never electic and I I didn't like I

1:46:11.719,1:46:19.210
learned that I didn't like looking and

1:46:14.719,1:46:22.639
it's a screen yeah the early computers a

1:46:19.210,1:46:25.849
lot of it was said it was not good for

1:46:22.639,1:46:29.060
epileptics okay and so you just and then

1:46:25.849,1:46:31.790
I didn't like I did I didn't like it I

1:46:29.060,1:46:35.719
like to paper I've got pages

1:46:31.790,1:46:40.010
I like type I love typewriters what do

1:46:35.719,1:46:42.130
you love about typewriters it's a big

1:46:40.010,1:46:42.130
question

1:46:42.360,1:46:49.159
I don't know I

1:46:49.850,1:46:57.420
is it a sound thing is it a female thing

1:46:53.940,1:46:59.159
no and I actually since the period of

1:46:57.420,1:47:01.500
burning my hand like I doubt I don't

1:46:59.159,1:47:03.630
type anywhere near as well because I

1:47:01.500,1:47:08.670
don't have perfect feeling in that

1:47:03.630,1:47:16.369
finger mm-hmm but it was the sense of

1:47:08.670,1:47:20.100
how sort of slovenly handwriting became

1:47:16.369,1:47:24.150
form mm-hmm I don't get that on this I

1:47:20.100,1:47:28.340
don't see lines on the screen call you

1:47:24.150,1:47:32.550
the same way and I don't feel as though

1:47:28.340,1:47:34.739
I'm making the letter well I do well

1:47:32.550,1:47:40.350
often I'm not I'm making the wrong

1:47:34.739,1:47:43.409
letter mm-hmm I I don't know why I like

1:47:40.350,1:47:45.510
it but it's probably I don't know why I

1:47:43.409,1:47:51.000
like it but it's been it's been such a

1:47:45.510,1:47:56.489
consistent part yeah every book yeah you

1:47:51.000,1:48:00.360
to skip all these computer questions and

1:47:56.489,1:48:04.380
yeah I mean you you correspond with many

1:48:00.360,1:48:06.330
people yeah how I used to be a much

1:48:04.380,1:48:08.880
better letter writer has that changed

1:48:06.330,1:48:11.820
quite a bit like I mean with receiving

1:48:08.880,1:48:14.429
in your mean you're sending out with the

1:48:11.820,1:48:17.670
kind of computer rise or has that is it

1:48:14.429,1:48:18.119
just sort of yeah it has changed a

1:48:17.670,1:48:22.460
little

1:48:18.119,1:48:29.550
yeah well but I long before I had my

1:48:22.460,1:48:32.730
little red friend I I had stopped

1:48:29.550,1:48:36.590
writing letters the way I once did I

1:48:32.730,1:48:36.590
mean it was a period in my life when

1:48:36.949,1:48:43.250
even like

1:48:38.809,1:48:46.460
ten 12 years ago I just wrote lots of

1:48:43.250,1:48:49.130
letters to lots of people and I loved

1:48:46.460,1:48:56.869
getting letters back and I loves writing

1:48:49.130,1:49:00.650
letters and then that stopped I don't

1:48:56.869,1:49:03.380
know why it stopped yeah but it wasn't

1:49:00.650,1:49:10.820
because of that what I've noticed with

1:49:03.380,1:49:16.309
this is I have now correspondence with

1:49:10.820,1:49:18.469
my first husband whom I had we had

1:49:16.309,1:49:20.150
exchange we would exchange letters every

1:49:18.469,1:49:24.110
two years or something they have very

1:49:20.150,1:49:28.369
informal letters yeah and and there was

1:49:24.110,1:49:30.159
a period in which he needed someone to

1:49:28.369,1:49:37.550
confide in

1:49:30.159,1:49:40.539
it was far away and so we had a a little

1:49:37.550,1:49:47.260
period of much more intense exchange

1:49:40.539,1:49:51.679
very short and I saw him and that his

1:49:47.260,1:49:54.139
current wife I saw him for the first

1:49:51.679,1:49:58.429
time in 38 years last summer

1:49:54.139,1:50:00.289
oh and we like each other and I thought

1:49:58.429,1:50:05.059
his life was just great

1:50:00.289,1:50:06.949
and it's helpful to kind of substitute

1:50:05.059,1:50:08.090
for a phone call and you don't feel like

1:50:06.949,1:50:11.389
making a phone call

1:50:08.090,1:50:13.219
yeah and it gives people a chance that

1:50:11.389,1:50:20.000
they would have with a letter but not a

1:50:13.219,1:50:23.929
phone call to respond when they're ready

1:50:20.000,1:50:27.789
to and not have a moment forced upon

1:50:23.929,1:50:31.429
them in which they have to react yeah so

1:50:27.789,1:50:33.349
so I I have very happy thoughts about

1:50:31.429,1:50:36.079
this which just has nothing to do with

1:50:33.349,1:50:37.110
with writing yeah and then I think you

1:50:36.079,1:50:39.300
know it was a big

1:50:37.110,1:50:44.690
when I switched from a long hand to the

1:50:39.300,1:50:48.660
typewriter maybe it would be equally

1:50:44.690,1:50:51.720
transforming - mm-hmm switch to a

1:50:48.660,1:50:55.350
computer but not an iPad yeah I would

1:50:51.720,1:50:59.280
need a big board and yeah but I can't

1:50:55.350,1:51:10.470
use a mouse still hmm I can't the ice

1:50:59.280,1:51:13.020
when I see that little it makes me very

1:51:10.470,1:51:16.140
skittish and upset yeah

1:51:13.020,1:51:18.510
so yeah you'd have to be maybe a

1:51:16.140,1:51:21.630
touchscreen but I think we're I think

1:51:18.510,1:51:26.590
what we're ended so thank you so much

1:51:21.630,1:51:29.569
please have we ended the car well

1:51:26.590,1:51:29.569
