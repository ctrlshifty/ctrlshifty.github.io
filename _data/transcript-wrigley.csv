0:03:37.590,0:03:44.48,substantial electronic presence

0:03:41.150,0:03:45.98,fortunately I don't think that would

0:03:45.989,0:03:58.70,any money off me anyway okay all right

0:03:54.260,0:04:02.87,going back there how where were you we

0:03:58.709,0:04:06.87,started out in Edinburgh in Scotland

0:04:02.879,0:04:08.94,okay and read at a place called the

0:04:06.870,0:04:11.12,Scottish poetry library which is just

0:04:08.940,0:04:11.12,fantastic

0:04:12.370,0:04:19.59,um had a standing-room-only crowd was

0:04:16.180,0:04:24.97,just that was terrific then went to lobs

0:04:19.590,0:04:26.22,all bra which looks like Alda bird but

0:04:24.970,0:04:30.28,it's pronounced all bro

0:04:26.229,0:04:31.93,I had a Poetry Festival which was

0:04:30.280,0:04:33.52,incredibly wonderful but you can only go

0:04:31.930,0:04:35.53,there every ten years so I'll be ancient

0:04:33.520,0:04:43.78,by the time Li they will confine me

0:04:35.530,0:04:47.16,again then let's see went to Norwich and

0:04:43.780,0:04:50.49,Newcastle and Hull I've got a picture of

0:04:47.169,0:04:53.13,myself standing next to the statue of

0:04:50.490,0:04:54.88,Philip Larkin in the train station oh

0:04:53.139,0:04:58.86,yeah yeah which is about six feet nine

0:04:54.880,0:04:58.86,inches tall he was not that tall

0:05:00.479,0:05:05.28,then went to Newcastle or he did good

0:05:03.639,0:05:09.49,yeah said Newcastle on shrine I came

0:05:05.289,0:05:11.19,everywhere else I was and then wound up

0:05:09.490,0:05:13.51,in London for a couple of days which was

0:05:11.199,0:05:15.55,great and did the BBC interview and did

0:05:13.510,0:05:19.27,a couple of other interviews with

0:05:15.550,0:05:21.55,magazines and got a poem published in

0:05:19.270,0:05:23.71,the time in the tls literary supplement

0:05:21.550,0:05:28.78,while I was there with that yeah it was

0:05:23.710,0:05:30.46,it was very cool I have been really

0:05:28.780,0:05:33.78,enjoying anatomy melancholy

0:05:30.460,0:05:36.76,I've enjoyed many halls but let that one

0:05:33.789,0:05:39.16,is then I've been considering it right

0:05:36.760,0:05:40.57,now well of course I'm especially fond

0:05:39.160,0:05:44.86,of it because it's like the newest baby

0:05:40.570,0:05:46.84,but yeah well it is an interesting move

0:05:44.860,0:05:48.31,I think I mean it changes in a sort of I

0:05:46.840,0:05:50.94,mean it still got your sort you know

0:05:48.310,0:05:53.71,your sort of your subjects but it it

0:05:50.949,0:05:56.65,kind of has like a focusing

0:05:53.719,0:05:58.54,it's a vastly more elusive book too than

0:05:56.659,0:06:00.83,any hang I've published before so and I

0:05:58.549,0:06:02.47,I think the Brits appreciated that too

0:06:00.830,0:06:09.79,because I was continually picking

0:06:02.479,0:06:15.64,British poets pockets no all right well

0:06:09.799,0:06:17.53,to the boring question there are no

0:06:15.649,0:06:18.97,boring questions only boring answers and

0:06:17.539,0:06:21.37,I can't guarantee that I won't be boring

0:06:18.979,0:06:24.16,well I'm sort of after boring this in

0:06:21.379,0:06:25.24,some ways because I mean you know I

0:06:24.169,0:06:27.22,think it's going to be kind of an

0:06:25.249,0:06:29.47,accumulative thing in some ways I mean

0:06:27.229,0:06:32.53,like how does these person you know make

0:06:29.479,0:06:33.67,it whatever is I mean it sort I guess

0:06:32.539,0:06:36.16,the question that I'm interested in is

0:06:33.679,0:06:38.20,like you know like the cotton and this

0:06:36.169,0:06:39.37,is kind of coming some other reading but

0:06:38.209,0:06:41.65,you kind of think of like how a poem

0:06:39.379,0:06:45.13,comes to be in life but the problem with

0:06:41.659,0:06:48.49,thinking about in a sort of genesis of a

0:06:45.139,0:06:49.87,moment that that problem of like

0:06:48.499,0:06:51.01,thinking there's a poem out here and

0:06:49.879,0:06:52.54,it's more you know the interaction of

0:06:51.019,0:06:55.03,your mind and the surface of the mind in

0:06:52.549,0:06:57.16,the in the screen that becomes success

0:06:55.039,0:06:59.59,work um you know think that sort of back

0:06:57.169,0:07:00.91,and forth and so I'm trying to track

0:06:59.599,0:07:02.83,that in some ways

0:07:00.919,0:07:06.15,good luck I mean I think it'd be really

0:07:02.839,0:07:09.88,interesting to to know if this

0:07:06.159,0:07:12.28,technology we well it's inescapable at

0:07:09.889,0:07:16.09,this point I know how it affects the way

0:07:12.289,0:07:20.14,we write right and it clearly does yeah

0:07:16.099,0:07:21.25,it has and can will continue so I don't

0:07:20.149,0:07:23.02,think it's bad I don't think it's any

0:07:21.259,0:07:24.58,any different than any other than the

0:07:23.029,0:07:26.71,advent of any other kind of technology

0:07:24.589,0:07:33.37,whether it's movable type or right or

0:07:26.719,0:07:36.46,the typewriter so great um yeah so okay

0:07:33.379,0:07:37.61,let er rip so okay so I've got sort of a

0:07:36.469,0:07:40.36,couple different sections the first

0:07:37.610,0:07:42.91,section is based on that initial survey

0:07:40.369,0:07:45.52,of writers that I did and it's more

0:07:42.919,0:07:47.11,focused on computers in saving and it's

0:07:45.529,0:07:48.75,sort of meant to be more gone through

0:07:47.119,0:07:50.89,kind of quickly and then we'll get to

0:07:48.759,0:07:52.78,more about your writing process in

0:07:50.899,0:07:57.16,general and how that's changed over the

0:07:52.789,0:07:58.69,years from so a couple things I don't

0:07:57.169,0:08:00.28,mind if you're repeating yourself as

0:07:58.699,0:08:02.08,well but if you're getting annoyed with

0:08:00.289,0:08:04.99,questions that are sort of getting at

0:08:02.089,0:08:06.02,the same thing just wave me on I feel

0:08:04.999,0:08:08.00,like anything I gave

0:08:06.020,0:08:10.28,be working I'm not going to like present

0:08:08.000,0:08:13.61,this on TV right just as well

0:08:10.280,0:08:15.59,so I didn't dress up if Allah is the

0:08:13.610,0:08:17.93,third of the way that it goes although

0:08:15.590,0:08:21.05,this is my this is this shirt used to

0:08:17.930,0:08:23.69,belong to James Welch the great novelist

0:08:21.050,0:08:27.05,and kuba ganas poet Blackfeet Indian

0:08:23.690,0:08:29.96,from Montana and this was a gift from

0:08:27.050,0:08:35.00,his widow so it's what I put on whatever

0:08:29.960,0:08:36.91,I come out here um well I'm one to talk

0:08:35.000,0:08:38.87,about routine and schedule suppose

0:08:36.919,0:08:44.12,that's here that we'll get to that

0:08:38.870,0:08:45.86,okay so first you would please face your

0:08:44.120,0:08:50.14,name your date of birth in the location

0:08:45.860,0:08:54.02,where we are I am Robert Wrigley I was

0:08:50.149,0:08:56.87,born February 27 to 1951 we are sitting

0:08:54.020,0:08:59.77,in my little studio building which is

0:08:56.870,0:09:02.86,called stanza one of the two Italian

0:08:59.779,0:09:06.32,words the lesser Italian word for room

0:09:02.860,0:09:12.86,on Moscow mountain not far well six

0:09:06.320,0:09:15.44,miles north of Moscow Idaho and how long

0:09:12.860,0:09:21.05,have you been writing in this spot I

0:09:15.440,0:09:27.07,built this building in 2002 so 11 years

0:09:21.050,0:09:30.35,in this space so so here's this sort of

0:09:27.079,0:09:33.11,quick and dirty questions but so what's

0:09:30.350,0:09:35.18,your what job are you working well

0:09:33.110,0:09:38.50,poetry almost exclusively every now and

0:09:35.180,0:09:41.06,then I'm sort of forced to commit prose

0:09:38.500,0:09:44.60,like a craft lecture or something

0:09:41.060,0:09:46.61,and and I've got a bunch of those that

0:09:44.600,0:09:48.14,someday people keep telling me I should

0:09:46.610,0:09:50.32,make a book out of but mostly I'm just

0:09:48.140,0:09:54.74,I'm not interested I'd rather write

0:09:50.329,0:09:57.10,poems yeah and so what kind of devices

0:09:54.740,0:10:00.70,do you own or have access to for your a

0:09:57.100,0:10:03.95,meaning electronic devices either or

0:10:00.700,0:10:07.97,well I mean most fundamentally of course

0:10:03.950,0:10:11.89,is the computer I have one laptop that's

0:10:07.970,0:10:14.66,my my private computer which sometimes I

0:10:11.899,0:10:16.16,compose on always I compose prose on the

0:10:14.660,0:10:17.72,computer I can't imagine being a prose

0:10:16.160,0:10:22.57,writer in writing in longhand but some

0:10:17.720,0:10:28.20,people do you know beyond debt I have

0:10:22.579,0:10:30.86,pencils and pens and notebooks do you

0:10:28.209,0:10:36.23,what so what's what's your operating

0:10:30.860,0:10:40.39,okay I have a Mac what is it a MacBook

0:10:36.230,0:10:42.56,Air and I no longer have an external

0:10:40.399,0:10:44.89,hard drive back when I had a PC I had an

0:10:42.560,0:10:46.79,external hard drive where backed up

0:10:44.899,0:10:50.35,everything from the hard drive of the

0:10:46.790,0:10:53.39,computer onto an external drive now I

0:10:50.350,0:10:58.39,put things into the cloud the iCloud I

0:10:53.390,0:11:00.41,back stuff up on mozi just to just to

0:10:58.399,0:11:02.30,keep reading theoretically at least I've

0:11:00.410,0:11:06.26,never had to go retrieve anything but

0:11:02.300,0:11:07.79,theoretically it's safe there yeah that

0:11:06.260,0:11:12.14,is definitely some of the questions um

0:11:07.790,0:11:14.27,do you uh so you have do you have like

0:11:12.140,0:11:15.56,do you work on a devices at the

0:11:14.270,0:11:17.36,university at all or is there just the

0:11:15.560,0:11:19.79,one device you ever moved things for one

0:11:17.360,0:11:21.41,device to the other no I try to keep I

0:11:19.790,0:11:23.93,try to keep what I write the poems

0:11:21.410,0:11:26.87,themselves away from the university

0:11:23.930,0:11:29.32,machines do just because the university

0:11:26.870,0:11:30.80,owns the machine and I'd really don't

0:11:29.329,0:11:35.63,want anything that I own on that

0:11:30.800,0:11:39.05,university machine how do you save your

0:11:35.630,0:11:41.89,prewriting read your notes I print off a

0:11:39.050,0:11:45.26,lot of things there's a pile of drafts

0:11:41.899,0:11:46.94,back here that in fact need to be moved

0:11:45.260,0:11:49.67,to a box but I haven't brought the new

0:11:46.940,0:11:52.76,box out from the house and it takes me

0:11:49.670,0:11:54.88,usually a box will take two years to

0:11:52.760,0:11:57.01,fill and then it go

0:11:54.880,0:11:58.54,into storage in the in the basement

0:11:57.010,0:12:00.40,until somebody offers me enough money

0:11:58.540,0:12:05.26,for it and then they can have all the

0:12:00.400,0:12:06.97,boxes oh so do you save the drafts of

0:12:05.260,0:12:08.74,your individual works if you go along if

0:12:06.970,0:12:10.75,you save it like as one poem or do you

0:12:08.740,0:12:13.57,put them all together or you say oh I

0:12:10.750,0:12:15.46,don't put them all together I do it it

0:12:13.570,0:12:18.01,seems to me that it would it would

0:12:15.460,0:12:19.72,probably be a good idea to do something

0:12:18.010,0:12:22.03,like that and if I were to do something

0:12:19.720,0:12:25.06,like that if someone comes along and

0:12:22.030,0:12:27.58,once my papers it would be a lot happier

0:12:25.060,0:12:30.72,if I had them organized in some way but

0:12:27.580,0:12:34.72,basically the pile which is not very

0:12:30.720,0:12:37.06,even evenly stacked is pretty much the

0:12:34.720,0:12:40.33,way they go into the box so that I will

0:12:37.060,0:12:45.07,work on a poem print off a draft put a

0:12:40.330,0:12:47.80,date on it and the number of see just

0:12:45.070,0:12:49.84,pulling the one off the top this is a

0:12:47.800,0:12:52.12,little draft of a poem called goodbye to

0:12:49.840,0:12:55.66,the river which I have no memory of

0:12:52.120,0:12:59.65,but this draft was composed on the

0:12:55.660,0:13:02.83,fifteenth of October 19 2013 and it's

0:12:59.650,0:13:05.98,draft number two so Ikey I do have a

0:13:02.830,0:13:07.78,sort of I have a system and I suppose if

0:13:05.980,0:13:09.76,someone were really interested in were

0:13:07.780,0:13:14.23,to go through the boxes which ultimately

0:13:09.760,0:13:16.35,have a year on them or a period of years

0:13:14.230,0:13:18.31,on them if it takes me long until one

0:13:16.350,0:13:20.74,someone could go through and actually

0:13:18.310,0:13:23.02,find the poems under a certain title and

0:13:20.740,0:13:26.97,and put them in order in the order in

0:13:23.020,0:13:29.38,which day they came into being of it

0:13:26.970,0:13:32.38,although sometimes I change title so I

0:13:29.380,0:13:35.32,don't know what that does to that's just

0:13:32.380,0:13:37.87,across you well it look it will keep

0:13:35.320,0:13:42.81,said researcher should he or she ever

0:13:37.870,0:13:45.49,exist is he yes well through tenure yeah

0:13:42.810,0:13:48.01,so okay so you're just saying you back

0:13:45.490,0:13:51.52,up you back up your work by using a

0:13:48.010,0:13:55.09,summary thought or folder which backs up

0:13:51.520,0:13:56.59,your work to the server and you can most

0:13:55.090,0:14:00.79,in all your all your poems are in one

0:13:56.590,0:14:02.50,location how do you say like how do you

0:14:00.790,0:14:04.43,stable work that's been published you

0:14:02.500,0:14:07.55,put it in a different place you

0:14:04.430,0:14:12.52,I do I have I have this which is sort of

0:14:07.550,0:14:16.51,the in process folder that little thesis

0:14:12.529,0:14:20.06,binders are called it Harvard and

0:14:16.510,0:14:21.35,there's the the in the back go all the

0:14:20.060,0:14:25.27,poems that have been published with the

0:14:21.350,0:14:27.17,the name of the magazine on it and in

0:14:25.279,0:14:32.06,front of the are the ones that I'm that

0:14:27.170,0:14:34.85,are still in progress have you ever

0:14:32.060,0:14:37.39,observed have you ever received her

0:14:34.850,0:14:39.11,sought out information about methods for

0:14:37.399,0:14:41.36,kind of best practices for digital

0:14:39.110,0:14:43.27,archiving I never have and probably I

0:14:41.360,0:14:45.74,should I talked to Daniel Orosco a lot

0:14:43.279,0:14:50.30,who's who is so frightened of losing

0:14:45.740,0:14:53.54,things that he's he backs everything up

0:14:50.300,0:14:56.75,on a jump drive I think maybe too he

0:14:53.540,0:14:58.37,uses mosey he uses one other backup

0:14:56.750,0:15:01.76,service as well

0:14:58.370,0:15:03.86,prints things I mean he's he's anal

0:15:01.760,0:15:05.36,about it and I can't really blame him

0:15:03.860,0:15:07.79,he's a prose writer though they lose

0:15:05.360,0:15:10.45,weight you lose a file there you could

0:15:07.790,0:15:12.08,lose hundreds of pages right right yeah

0:15:10.459,0:15:13.73,I think that was one of the interesting

0:15:12.080,0:15:15.62,things we thought was that there were a

0:15:13.730,0:15:17.45,lot of not maybe through the rest of

0:15:15.620,0:15:19.61,extent but of people who would do that

0:15:17.450,0:15:22.31,but then the issue becomes for them a

0:15:19.610,0:15:23.93,lot of times is what's what in which

0:15:22.310,0:15:26.33,about which version is which and the

0:15:23.930,0:15:28.64,kind of mess of that and like I mean you

0:15:26.330,0:15:30.70,think your is that your files will be

0:15:28.640,0:15:32.06,difficult his files will be you know

0:15:30.709,0:15:33.23,because there's not a date on them

0:15:32.060,0:15:34.88,there's no handwriting there's no

0:15:33.230,0:15:37.22,indication or I'm going to be kind with

0:15:34.880,0:15:41.65,what right well and I tried to use you

0:15:37.220,0:15:41.65,know how when you save something in say

0:15:42.279,0:15:46.61,Microsoft Word

0:15:44.360,0:15:48.44,yeah when you save it it gives you a

0:15:46.610,0:15:50.30,date but then you resave it you modified

0:15:48.440,0:15:52.67,URI save and it's completely new date so

0:15:50.300,0:15:55.25,the old date goes away so you know I

0:15:52.670,0:15:57.77,found that that I couldn't rely on that

0:15:55.250,0:15:59.66,at all I had to put a pencil debate or a

0:15:57.770,0:16:02.02,pen date on the corner of the draft just

0:15:59.660,0:16:06.64,so I knew which was which and when was

0:16:02.029,0:16:08.14,what yeah yeah and I think that it's

0:16:06.649,0:16:10.91,important I don't know that that's

0:16:08.149,0:16:14.12,important whereas in in the notebook you

0:16:10.910,0:16:16.60,know I starts with a date and every page

0:16:14.120,0:16:19.24,every page is dated

0:16:16.600,0:16:21.64,so I know exactly which I can go back

0:16:19.240,0:16:23.70,into the notebooks which I do with some

0:16:21.640,0:16:25.92,regularity just to sift through and see

0:16:23.709,0:16:28.81,if I missed anything that there's some

0:16:25.920,0:16:32.23,some piece that I might resurrect and

0:16:28.810,0:16:36.45,make use of I know exactly when I first

0:16:32.230,0:16:38.83,put it down yeah yeah okay so so that

0:16:36.459,0:16:40.24,was sort of a precursor all those

0:16:38.830,0:16:42.43,basically to ten questions are coming

0:16:40.240,0:16:45.43,back but this is going to be kind of

0:16:42.430,0:16:48.10,more overarching on your practice over

0:16:45.430,0:16:50.62,time so how long have you been writing

0:16:48.100,0:16:52.83,professionally in which I mean something

0:16:50.620,0:16:55.50,that's sort of either your main focus or

0:16:52.839,0:16:59.23,something that's the supporting eight

0:16:55.500,0:17:03.56,well I really I guess I I would say

0:16:59.230,0:17:05.74,since 197,
0:17:03.569,0:17:07.68,which was when I was at in fact an

0:17:05.740,0:17:13.08,undergraduate student I got discharged

0:17:07.689,0:17:16.63,from the Army in 1971 got drafted went

0:17:13.089,0:17:20.11,back to college and within a matter of a

0:17:16.630,0:17:21.76,few months was waylaid by poetry I

0:17:20.110,0:17:25.12,didn't want to be a poet I never really

0:17:21.760,0:17:27.01,had a whole lot of use for poetry I took

0:17:25.120,0:17:29.35,the class on a kind of lark thinking how

0:17:27.010,0:17:31.60,hard can it be doesn't have to go very

0:17:29.350,0:17:33.25,far across the page whereas I could tell

0:17:31.600,0:17:35.50,it doesn't have to rhyme anymore you

0:17:33.250,0:17:39.52,don't have to have any kind of regular

0:17:35.500,0:17:41.55,meter and as far as I could tell most

0:17:39.520,0:17:44.74,people couldn't figure out what it meant

0:17:41.550,0:17:46.17,anyway so I I can do that I can get

0:17:44.740,0:17:47.53,three credits that way well I walked

0:17:46.179,0:17:50.35,into the class and I got absolutely

0:17:47.530,0:17:52.41,waylaid and that was 1972 which was 4,
0:17:50.350,0:17:54.46,years ago and where was it

0:17:52.410,0:18:02.29,southern Illinois University at

0:17:54.460,0:18:04.72,Edwardsville my first poetry professor

0:18:02.290,0:18:11.35,was a man behind of Clyde fix me who's

0:18:04.720,0:18:12.28,still alive pushing 80 was really kind

0:18:11.350,0:18:15.25,of failed poet

0:18:12.280,0:18:19.48,I'd never wanted him to hear me say that

0:18:15.250,0:18:20.65,of course but he's published I think two

0:18:19.480,0:18:21.86,or three books and they've all been

0:18:20.650,0:18:25.57,self-published

0:18:21.860,0:18:28.52,he never really had the belly for the

0:18:25.570,0:18:30.50,getting out into the what else you call

0:18:28.520,0:18:34.46,it the marketplace the literary world he

0:18:30.500,0:18:35.24,couldn't bear rejection and I figured

0:18:34.460,0:18:36.89,out early on

0:18:35.240,0:18:39.67,why didn't I as far as I knew for a long

0:18:36.890,0:18:41.33,time rejection was like that's what

0:18:39.679,0:18:43.73,happened although the first film I ever

0:18:41.330,0:18:45.83,sent out got accepted by our first batch

0:18:43.730,0:18:48.35,of poems I ever sent out I got something

0:18:45.830,0:18:53.03,accepted so I got like hooked on that

0:18:48.350,0:18:54.77,part of it too but publication you know

0:18:53.030,0:18:56.03,as you know publication is not the same

0:18:54.770,0:19:00.77,thing as writing they're they may be

0:18:56.030,0:19:02.45,almost entirely unrelated so that kind

0:19:00.770,0:19:04.34,of gets us started but I mean the next

0:19:02.450,0:19:06.65,question is sort of like could you give

0:19:04.340,0:19:09.32,us our general description of the arc of

0:19:06.650,0:19:16.52,your career starting with this portion

0:19:09.320,0:19:19.64,versus the next to automatically take

0:19:16.520,0:19:22.72,picture sir now if this is recording I'm

0:19:19.640,0:19:25.64,just kidding I know twice just stop

0:19:22.720,0:19:29.50,because they filled up really fast it's

0:19:25.640,0:19:29.50,a higher-resolution thing

0:19:34.649,0:19:38.90,so yeah so I'm sorry

0:19:36.659,0:19:41.09,so get back to sort of the general Greek

0:19:38.909,0:19:44.09,or not the large arc of your career and

0:19:41.099,0:19:51.23,how this come take me seriously well I

0:19:44.099,0:19:56.48,mean I I'm I'm a product of the creative

0:19:51.239,0:19:58.16,writing industry uh yeah I wanted to be

0:19:56.489,0:20:01.97,a writer I wanted to write novel so I

0:19:58.169,0:20:03.57,wanted to write novels that sold a lot

0:20:01.979,0:20:04.83,of copies made me a lot of money I

0:20:03.570,0:20:06.69,wanted to live in the south and France

0:20:04.830,0:20:10.71,I'm serious about this debt enhancement

0:20:06.690,0:20:13.71,and as serious as a say a 21 year old

0:20:10.710,0:20:15.38,could have been you don't want to drive

0:20:13.710,0:20:17.33,an Aston Martin and live in the South of

0:20:15.389,0:20:20.58,France and date supermodels it seems

0:20:17.339,0:20:24.59,like a perfectly appropriate and maybe

0:20:20.580,0:20:27.98,even attainable career goal I was a I

0:20:24.599,0:20:30.77,was an idiot I didn't know anything and

0:20:27.989,0:20:37.67,but then I got waylaid by poetry and and

0:20:30.779,0:20:42.44,I think that I discovered or realized

0:20:37.679,0:20:48.05,that whatever sort of disposition I have

0:20:42.440,0:20:50.48,is is suited to poetry and not so much

0:20:48.059,0:20:52.55,to not so much to prose and certainly

0:20:50.489,0:20:54.40,not to fiction I did I have in fact

0:20:52.559,0:20:57.41,published a couple of short stories

0:20:54.409,0:21:02.75,years ago 25 years ago I think what's

0:20:57.419,0:21:05.07,the most recent one but they they never

0:21:02.759,0:21:09.02,made me happy never not like writing a

0:21:05.070,0:21:13.37,poem did so anyway I got I got waylaid

0:21:09.029,0:21:15.33,and and got real keen on poetry and

0:21:13.379,0:21:17.60,began haunting the library of my alma

0:21:15.330,0:21:18.84,mater and the department of the skinny

0:21:17.609,0:21:22.67,books you know

0:21:18.840,0:21:24.36,and looked into graduate school and

0:21:22.679,0:21:26.03,discovered there was this degree called

0:21:24.360,0:21:29.66,the Master of Fine Arts in which they

0:21:26.039,0:21:33.48,were 11 programs in the country that

0:21:29.669,0:21:39.57,offered that degree in 1972 I think and

0:21:33.480,0:21:42.14,one in Canada and applied to a number of

0:21:39.570,0:21:43.59,programs wound up going to Montana fell

0:21:42.149,0:21:45.50,in love with living in this part of the

0:21:43.590,0:21:49.23,world and really have never stopped in

0:21:45.509,0:21:50.90,terms of of writing north of living in

0:21:49.230,0:21:54.79,this part of the world so I got kind of

0:21:50.909,0:22:02.00,waylaid by geography and poetry

0:21:54.799,0:22:04.37,simultaneously the the arc of my career

0:22:02.009,0:22:07.83,aesthetically is a completely other kind

0:22:04.379,0:22:11.58,of well the kind of thing that was more

0:22:07.830,0:22:14.34,to sort of like in place person kind of

0:22:11.580,0:22:15.84,general overview where he were right

0:22:14.340,0:22:17.85,well when I went to Montana you know I

0:22:15.840,0:22:20.46,got the study with Madeleine DeFries

0:22:17.850,0:22:23.15,John Haynes and probably most famously

0:22:20.460,0:22:26.24,Richard Hugo and and they were you know

0:22:23.159,0:22:28.23,they were Dick Hugo and Madeleine trees

0:22:26.249,0:22:31.04,particularly were just enormous ly

0:22:28.230,0:22:36.45,important to me in terms of of the craft

0:22:31.049,0:22:42.92,of poetry and I don't think my notion of

0:22:36.450,0:22:44.78,the line is for me separable from what I

0:22:42.929,0:22:46.88,learned from Sarah Madeleine DeFries

0:22:44.789,0:22:50.45,dick was a completely other kind of

0:22:46.889,0:22:53.10,teacher but a magnificent teacher he

0:22:50.450,0:22:57.09,could make you see what you were doing

0:22:53.100,0:23:00.45,right and what you were doing wrong with

0:22:57.090,0:23:04.61,a phrase and that was that was a great

0:23:00.450,0:23:12.99,time and so you went from you were your

0:23:04.610,0:23:15.53,Montana and then I went to I went back

0:23:12.990,0:23:17.94,to my alma mater where I was an adjunct

0:23:15.539,0:23:20.09,for a year and applied for jobs as close

0:23:17.940,0:23:23.10,to Missoula Montana as I could find and

0:23:20.090,0:23:26.24,the the first job that I got was down at

0:23:23.100,0:23:29.19,LCSC in 1977 I was a sabbatical

0:23:26.249,0:23:31.36,replacement for you

0:23:29.190,0:23:34.63,but they loved me and tried to

0:23:31.360,0:23:36.01,immediately make a tenure-track position

0:23:34.630,0:23:38.41,for me which they offered me and I

0:23:36.010,0:23:41.49,turned down because I had an NEA and I

0:23:38.410,0:23:44.17,didn't want a job but I wound up working

0:23:41.490,0:23:46.42,teaching a couple classes for that year

0:23:44.170,0:23:48.28,and then I started tenure track on a job

0:23:46.420,0:23:52.60,that was really kind of a that I helped

0:23:48.280,0:23:54.97,for 22 years that was not a great job

0:23:52.600,0:23:58.66,for a poet because the teaching load was

0:23:54.970,0:24:00.28,for for for a long time and then somehow

0:23:58.660,0:24:04.60,I convinced them that I should have a

0:24:00.280,0:24:06.82,3/3 load and then ultimately Kim and I

0:24:04.600,0:24:10.00,split the job and each talked to two and

0:24:06.820,0:24:13.33,it was fine that was great but then the

0:24:10.000,0:24:15.28,position opened up here and the only

0:24:13.330,0:24:16.36,other place I was really interested or

0:24:15.280,0:24:20.29,would have been interested in going

0:24:16.360,0:24:21.85,would have been Montana yeah and but I

0:24:20.290,0:24:23.59,love Moscow and I love Idaho and I've

0:24:21.850,0:24:27.91,been here for a long time so when this

0:24:23.590,0:24:30.49,job came along I I snapped it up hey

0:24:27.910,0:24:35.20,what year was that 1999 was my first

0:24:30.490,0:24:37.84,year at U of I how long had I think was

0:24:35.200,0:24:39.85,three years old then 96 was the first

0:24:37.840,0:24:43.87,year they admitted students made name in

0:24:39.850,0:24:46.18,97 I can't remember now so it's still a

0:24:43.870,0:24:49.81,pretty young program really yeah you

0:24:46.180,0:24:51.85,have anything occurs for most of it yeah

0:24:49.810,0:24:54.85,and so then you've been we've been out

0:24:51.850,0:24:59.32,here since then basically in the same

0:24:54.850,0:25:01.27,position same job and over this time

0:24:59.320,0:25:04.03,you've written can you kind of talk

0:25:01.270,0:25:09.07,about you've written like 70 look let's

0:25:04.030,0:25:13.81,see 99 the year I the year I was hired I

0:25:09.070,0:25:15.43,published reign of snakes the year I was

0:25:13.810,0:25:17.74,hired here I published dragon snakes

0:25:15.430,0:25:19.12,so since reign of snakes we got that one

0:25:17.740,0:25:25.84,although it was written while I was

0:25:19.120,0:25:29.08,teaching at LC so I've published ring of

0:25:25.840,0:25:30.79,snakes lives and the animals earthly

0:25:29.080,0:25:33.40,meditations beautiful country and now

0:25:30.790,0:25:37.41,anatomy of melancholy five five books

0:25:33.400,0:25:37.41,inside Bennett at U of I

0:25:37.880,0:25:42.32,okay so that's sort of a general

0:25:40.610,0:25:43.52,overview and then I'd like to kind of

0:25:42.320,0:25:46.70,start about your writing process

0:25:43.520,0:25:49.37,generally and I've got it kind of broken

0:25:46.700,0:25:52.88,into three portions one being kind of

0:25:49.370,0:25:55.78,the tops of compositional spots like

0:25:52.880,0:25:59.33,prewriting those kind of development of

0:25:55.789,0:26:01.49,work into its first draft and then the

0:25:59.330,0:26:03.14,next being sort of revisional with how

0:26:01.490,0:26:04.66,do you revise federal talk and that'll

0:26:03.140,0:26:06.35,be kind of the next thing and then the

0:26:04.669,0:26:08.75,third process being an organizational

0:26:06.350,0:26:10.46,archival if that doesn't make sense with

0:26:08.750,0:26:11.80,your writing process we can write a talk

0:26:10.460,0:26:13.73,about it differently that's just how I

0:26:11.809,0:26:14.53,have what we'll see see how because it

0:26:13.730,0:26:17.65,sounds fine to me

0:26:14.539,0:26:21.46,okay so when you first started writing

0:26:17.659,0:26:23.90,in Reverse maybe you know in Montana and

0:26:21.460,0:26:26.24,in the first sort of stages of the

0:26:23.900,0:26:29.48,career how what how did you kind of go

0:26:26.240,0:26:31.34,about writing a poem how did you kind of

0:26:29.480,0:26:33.65,get the idea how did you pre write if

0:26:31.340,0:26:36.28,you draft etc so that's sort of my first

0:26:33.650,0:26:39.50,question yeah I kept I have always and I

0:26:36.289,0:26:42.02,don't know where I have piles in these

0:26:39.500,0:26:44.33,little fellows in a moleskin a or

0:26:42.020,0:26:49.70,however one pronounces that I can never

0:26:44.330,0:26:51.02,tell I probably have 250 of these piled

0:26:49.700,0:26:54.53,somewhere I think they're in a box in

0:26:51.020,0:26:59.00,the house and they're they're just the

0:26:54.530,0:27:00.89,places where when I get an idea or an

0:26:59.000,0:27:05.39,image occurs to me or a phrase where I

0:27:00.890,0:27:07.85,see some phrase I I make a note I make

0:27:05.390,0:27:10.66,my that first note so that when I come

0:27:07.850,0:27:12.49,out here or where I go wherever it was I

0:27:10.669,0:27:14.48,was I happen to be doing the writing

0:27:12.490,0:27:16.25,anywhere along the way which was

0:27:14.480,0:27:19.66,sometimes at a kitchen table you never

0:27:16.250,0:27:22.73,knew back years ago I didn't have a

0:27:19.669,0:27:24.95,space to write it I had this one or the

0:27:22.730,0:27:27.98,most recent couple of these to just

0:27:24.950,0:27:31.30,consult just to sort of trip on the

0:27:27.980,0:27:35.05,switch sometimes though I mean you

0:27:31.309,0:27:36.86,exhaust those things or nothing in the

0:27:35.059,0:27:39.28,little notebook interest to me so I just

0:27:36.860,0:27:42.59,come out and that's why this there's

0:27:39.289,0:27:44.99,this pile of books here on on the futon

0:27:42.590,0:27:46.49,they are all books I've pulled down as

0:27:44.990,0:27:51.26,well as a little pilot I brought back

0:27:46.490,0:27:53.17,from Italy and Italy England I'll just

0:27:51.260,0:27:55.64,come out and I'll look at the shelves

0:27:53.179,0:27:58.61,and pull a book off the shelves almost

0:27:55.640,0:28:00.23,at random I mean sometimes I have no

0:27:58.610,0:28:02.12,idea what book it is I'm reaching for

0:28:00.230,0:28:04.54,it's just something about the color will

0:28:02.120,0:28:06.20,appeal to me and I'll open up open it up

0:28:04.549,0:28:08.57,some through it look for a poem or look

0:28:06.200,0:28:10.78,for a word a title of phrase anything

0:28:08.570,0:28:11.80,that just turns on a switch that just

0:28:10.789,0:28:13.85,gets me started

0:28:11.809,0:28:18.16,mostly it's always seemed to me that the

0:28:13.850,0:28:20.27,only way I can get started is to just

0:28:18.169,0:28:22.30,start putting words on paper so that's

0:28:20.270,0:28:28.90,when I turn to this to this notebook

0:28:22.309,0:28:30.95,seems far less effective to me to sit

0:28:28.909,0:28:32.72,down at the computer and try to begin

0:28:30.950,0:28:34.97,composing what I don't have anything in

0:28:32.720,0:28:37.46,particular on my mind whereas in the

0:28:34.970,0:28:40.49,notebook itself you can you can or I can

0:28:37.460,0:28:42.71,doodle I can write a phrase I can just

0:28:40.490,0:28:44.02,sort of noodle around the way out you

0:28:42.710,0:28:46.57,know the way a musician would noodle

0:28:44.029,0:28:49.66,around with a musical phrase to see

0:28:46.570,0:28:52.39,where it leads me and and you know I've

0:28:49.669,0:28:55.10,always believed that writing begets

0:28:52.399,0:28:57.16,writing so that the more I noodle around

0:28:55.100,0:28:59.12,something eventually is going to

0:28:57.169,0:29:03.16,interest me something eventually is

0:28:59.120,0:29:05.36,going to to find a way to connect with

0:29:03.169,0:29:08.55,the next thing the next word the next

0:29:05.360,0:29:09.83,phrase or it kind of moved toward an

0:29:08.559,0:29:11.39,idea

0:29:09.830,0:29:13.07,I hate using the word idea though

0:29:11.390,0:29:14.75,talking talking about poems because some

0:29:13.070,0:29:16.66,people you know people always ask things

0:29:14.750,0:29:18.44,like and they tend to be people who've

0:29:16.669,0:29:19.76,never really written before or who are

0:29:18.440,0:29:20.77,at the beginning of trying to write

0:29:19.760,0:29:22.58,they'll say where do you get your ideas

0:29:20.779,0:29:25.94,for poems and I always want to say what

0:29:22.580,0:29:28.42,ideas where because they tend not to

0:29:25.940,0:29:31.01,come from from ideas they tend to come

0:29:28.429,0:29:33.71,from words or phrases or images or

0:29:31.010,0:29:35.89,something I've seen outside the outside

0:29:33.710,0:29:38.59,the window that's why I don't know about

0:29:35.899,0:29:43.42,who is it who is here most recently ah

0:29:38.590,0:29:45.47,wide Hirsch came out here showed me my

0:29:43.429,0:29:47.02,space he said the desk I said I I

0:29:45.470,0:29:50.27,couldn't write here all I do is look out

0:29:47.029,0:29:51.40,the window well it's true I spend a lot

0:29:50.270,0:29:53.12,of time looking out the window but

0:29:51.409,0:29:55.85,that's just my way of inviting what was

0:29:53.120,0:29:58.82,side into the poems and those kinds of

0:29:55.850,0:30:02.42,things are what occurred to me as

0:29:58.820,0:30:04.25,language somehow the lens of the writing

0:30:02.420,0:30:06.68,studio the lens that is my eyes an

0:30:04.250,0:30:08.60,imagination of language can convert what

0:30:06.680,0:30:11.95,it is I see into some kind of a phrase

0:30:08.600,0:30:16.79,that's useful and I can build with um

0:30:11.950,0:30:18.11,what is so you know books into this

0:30:16.790,0:30:21.41,notebook which could you describe what

0:30:18.110,0:30:23.12,the network is yeah this is a what is

0:30:21.410,0:30:25.94,one of the colonies this is the gemstone

0:30:23.120,0:30:29.36,collection and this is mostly what I've

0:30:25.940,0:30:31.34,been using for the last well 20 years I

0:30:29.360,0:30:34.67,was teaching at the University of Oregon

0:30:31.340,0:30:36.55,for a year and the graduate students

0:30:34.670,0:30:38.57,bought me one of these and I and I and I

0:30:36.559,0:30:44.15,loved it so much that I'm buying these

0:30:38.570,0:30:48.47,ever since and that's when I really

0:30:44.150,0:30:50.63,start getting getting movement toward a

0:30:48.470,0:30:53.57,poem to happen and it used to be as I

0:30:50.630,0:30:57.05,said hold homes would happen dog in

0:30:53.570,0:31:00.74,those notebooks now it can be a stanza

0:30:57.050,0:31:03.71,it can be 20 or 30 or 50 lines if it's

0:31:00.740,0:31:07.82,along a longer thing when I'll get

0:31:03.710,0:31:09.98,impatient with the sort of the the

0:31:07.820,0:31:14.03,slowness of the process writing my

0:31:09.980,0:31:16.58,always ready to pencil and and I'll go

0:31:14.030,0:31:18.95,to the computer or I'll get stopped I

0:31:16.580,0:31:20.66,won't know where to go I mean you know

0:31:18.950,0:31:22.10,what this is like yeah you just okay

0:31:20.660,0:31:23.21,what's the next thing that happens in

0:31:22.100,0:31:27.50,this poem and I don't know

0:31:23.210,0:31:31.97,and somehow converting the handwritten

0:31:27.500,0:31:34.33,text to text on the computer screen and

0:31:31.970,0:31:39.05,it was with the typewriter even before

0:31:34.330,0:31:41.90,can allow you to see things about its

0:31:39.050,0:31:43.52,structure or about its its movement that

0:31:41.900,0:31:46.61,you might not have seen while you're in

0:31:43.520,0:31:49.85,the midst of it it's almost like the

0:31:46.610,0:31:52.91,handwriting became something I did that

0:31:49.850,0:31:54.83,swallowed me and I had to escape from

0:31:52.910,0:31:57.92,the handwriting and put things down

0:31:54.830,0:31:59.93,on the computer screen let's say now in

0:31:57.920,0:32:03.20,order to have some sense of what might

0:31:59.930,0:32:04.43,come next and so before you were using

0:32:03.200,0:32:06.83,the computer you were using the

0:32:04.430,0:32:09.95,typewriter in the same similar yeah yeah

0:32:06.830,0:32:11.42,I had I had an IBM Selectric I guess

0:32:09.950,0:32:13.58,even before that I had some other kind

0:32:11.420,0:32:15.37,of electric typewriter but uh and I

0:32:13.580,0:32:17.75,would type it up as far as I could go

0:32:15.370,0:32:20.00,and then wait and see what would happen

0:32:17.750,0:32:24.77,usually what that meant was that it

0:32:20.000,0:32:26.39,would I I take the the pull model that

0:32:24.770,0:32:30.47,the typewriter as far as it went

0:32:26.390,0:32:32.03,and write it back down longhand in the

0:32:30.470,0:32:33.41,notebook but it would look different it

0:32:32.030,0:32:36.35,would I would have shaped it differently

0:32:33.410,0:32:40.10,because looking at it on this on the

0:32:36.350,0:32:43.58,screen gives it the appearance more of a

0:32:40.100,0:32:45.83,kind of permanence which is dangerous I

0:32:43.580,0:32:48.32,think it's danger it would have been

0:32:45.830,0:32:52.58,dangerous for me in the beginning I

0:32:48.320,0:32:55.16,think to compose on a word processor or

0:32:52.580,0:32:58.25,a typewriter because it might have given

0:32:55.160,0:33:01.97,me this inclination toward a particular

0:32:58.250,0:33:03.41,kind of structure that in fact was that

0:33:01.970,0:33:07.58,would not have been as interesting or

0:33:03.410,0:33:10.49,its evocative to me now you know I'm

0:33:07.580,0:33:12.65,perfectly comfortable just looking at

0:33:10.490,0:33:15.11,lines on the computer screen and saying

0:33:12.650,0:33:16.67,wait a minute why am i why are these

0:33:15.110,0:33:20.63,lines the way they are and I'm a

0:33:16.670,0:33:23.09,compulsive syllable counter even if

0:33:20.630,0:33:24.92,ultimately in revisions I wind up

0:33:23.090,0:33:29.15,exercising syllables are adding

0:33:24.920,0:33:32.00,syllables I like composing say a deck of

0:33:29.150,0:33:34.88,syllabic line just to just to force me

0:33:32.000,0:33:40.76,into manipulating syntax to keep the

0:33:34.880,0:33:42.59,right margin mattering and and somehow

0:33:40.760,0:33:45.80,finding a that way of moving to calm

0:33:42.590,0:33:48.56,down the page it so when you win this

0:33:45.800,0:33:51.35,one a low first question is when did you

0:33:48.560,0:33:54.05,start using a computer to do these

0:33:51.350,0:33:55.43,things and then secondly what was there

0:33:54.050,0:33:56.81,anything that changed when you move from

0:33:55.430,0:33:58.52,typewriters computer was there a

0:33:56.810,0:34:01.43,different feeling a different service I

0:33:58.520,0:34:04.22,mean instead of about yeah III think

0:34:01.430,0:34:06.50,that in the beginning

0:34:04.220,0:34:10.09,and this probably would have been let's

0:34:06.500,0:34:16.39,see I got my first computer in the fall

0:34:10.099,0:34:18.37,of 1995 and I really honestly that this

0:34:16.399,0:34:21.57,is a so compute shortest imputed it had

0:34:18.379,0:34:26.35,a which I still have still works a

0:34:21.579,0:34:30.56,compact a little tiny laptop as we

0:34:26.359,0:34:34.27,called them then they've had a minimal

0:34:30.560,0:34:34.27,harddrive I think I nearly filled it up

0:34:34.869,0:34:39.20,but I think I kind of used it really as

0:34:37.099,0:34:41.24,just a sort of glorified typewriter with

0:34:39.200,0:34:43.57,a little screen is black and white

0:34:41.240,0:34:48.50,screen I mean there was nothing special

0:34:43.579,0:34:50.41,as a piece of technology so I used it as

0:34:48.500,0:34:52.28,a not so special piece of technology

0:34:50.419,0:34:54.53,kind of like a typewriter except that

0:34:52.280,0:34:57.34,you know you can save it and go back to

0:34:54.530,0:35:00.34,it and find it just the way you left it

0:34:57.349,0:35:01.57,and not have to type it completely in or

0:35:00.349,0:35:04.19,not have to go from the typewritten

0:35:01.579,0:35:08.56,sheet back to the notebook so there is a

0:35:04.190,0:35:10.09,kind of step that gets left out that was

0:35:08.569,0:35:13.13,the first time I started leaving out the

0:35:10.099,0:35:15.29,step of writing my hand then going to

0:35:13.130,0:35:16.73,the computer and then going back to the

0:35:15.290,0:35:21.41,typewriter then going back from the

0:35:16.730,0:35:23.32,typewritten sheet to the to longhand in

0:35:21.410,0:35:25.28,a way I suppose the best thing I could

0:35:23.329,0:35:27.20,have the thing I thought was best about

0:35:25.280,0:35:31.33,that part of the process when the

0:35:27.200,0:35:34.09,computer came along was it it saved time

0:35:31.339,0:35:36.26,I could I could immediately just look at

0:35:34.099,0:35:38.99,it on the screen go back to longhand and

0:35:36.260,0:35:40.97,then add what I'd written longhand on to

0:35:38.990,0:35:44.75,whatever I'd already saved on the

0:35:40.970,0:35:46.88,computer but it kept me from writing

0:35:44.750,0:35:49.46,everything back down and for a long time

0:35:46.880,0:35:53.21,I wondered about well what am I missing

0:35:49.460,0:35:55.25,there what might I what might I not have

0:35:53.210,0:35:56.75,seen that I would have seen if I'd been

0:35:55.250,0:36:00.94,writing in longhand and I used to say

0:35:56.750,0:36:03.29,things like the reason I keep writing

0:36:00.940,0:36:07.52,longhand or printing actually I print

0:36:03.290,0:36:10.94,this stuff is that it allows me to feel

0:36:07.520,0:36:14.61,the shapes of the letters themselves

0:36:10.940,0:36:16.84,it allows you to dispense words

0:36:14.619,0:36:18.55,incrementally and syllables not that the

0:36:16.849,0:36:21.70,typewriter the computer is any different

0:36:18.559,0:36:23.39,except that it is you sort of hear the

0:36:21.709,0:36:25.24,syllables more when you're writing it

0:36:23.390,0:36:28.54,out longhand or you certainly feel them

0:36:25.249,0:36:31.27,more when you're writing longhand but

0:36:28.549,0:36:34.21,eventually I began to see that and I

0:36:31.279,0:36:36.34,think Kim was part of the part of what

0:36:34.219,0:36:40.60,helped me see that you just said no

0:36:36.349,0:36:42.68,that's just silly why would why would

0:36:40.609,0:36:46.24,that really change anything I don't you

0:36:42.680,0:36:49.60,know you're right it doesn't change much

0:36:46.249,0:36:53.20,of anything so I began to be a whole lot

0:36:49.609,0:36:56.18,more comfortable than with with just

0:36:53.209,0:37:00.44,moving from in sort of one fell swoop

0:36:56.180,0:37:02.05,from the handwritten text to the to the

0:37:00.440,0:37:04.33,text on the computer which I would then

0:37:02.059,0:37:06.34,print out and then do extensive

0:37:04.339,0:37:07.51,revisions on arrows things crossed out

0:37:06.349,0:37:11.63,that sort of thing

0:37:07.519,0:37:13.83,oh sections crossed out so I guess you

0:37:11.630,0:37:17.18,can come move into sort of talking about

0:37:13.839,0:37:18.73,revision general exam and so you're

0:37:17.180,0:37:20.93,talking about how you probably take your

0:37:18.739,0:37:23.05,revision on the computer and the

0:37:20.930,0:37:25.81,differences between you are moving back

0:37:23.059,0:37:30.31,and forth more with the typewriter are

0:37:25.819,0:37:32.02,this sort of I guess what were your

0:37:30.319,0:37:34.06,practices when you first started I mean

0:37:32.029,0:37:38.83,like how did you kind of learn how to

0:37:34.069,0:37:45.31,revise that's a really good question

0:37:38.839,0:37:47.86,no I tell the students the graduate

0:37:45.319,0:37:50.26,students that I'm gonna hate to revise I

0:37:47.869,0:37:51.70,said um you can't hate to realise you

0:37:50.269,0:37:55.19,have to love to revise because that's

0:37:51.709,0:37:57.04,like most of the job ah you know if you

0:37:55.190,0:37:59.53,hate to revise it's like hating writing

0:37:57.049,0:38:05.18,because that's what that's really what

0:37:59.539,0:38:07.03,writing is and there came an end and I

0:38:05.180,0:38:09.61,like to tell them my own experience

0:38:07.039,0:38:13.91,which was that when in the beginning as

0:38:09.619,0:38:18.51,it were ah I didn't realize it but I

0:38:13.910,0:38:21.46,preferred to have written to writing I

0:38:18.519,0:38:23.23,really loved the finished product or

0:38:21.469,0:38:27.54,what I perceived as the finished product

0:38:23.239,0:38:30.97,which is the same a final in quotes

0:38:27.549,0:38:32.55,draft of a poem that's that's the part I

0:38:30.979,0:38:36.79,loved most

0:38:32.559,0:38:40.15,somewhere along the line I began to

0:38:36.799,0:38:42.65,prefer the process to the product

0:38:40.150,0:38:44.69,because that's that's the place where

0:38:42.650,0:38:46.90,all the excitement happens that the

0:38:44.690,0:38:53.90,place where you you surprise yourself

0:38:46.900,0:38:57.09,and the the process of revision is

0:38:53.900,0:39:00.17,certainly made so much more fluid and

0:38:57.099,0:39:03.07,Swift with the computer than it ever

0:39:00.170,0:39:05.77,could have been with writing longhand or

0:39:03.079,0:39:08.53,or or and then moving to the computer

0:39:05.779,0:39:11.74,it's so easy to drag-and-drop to cut and

0:39:08.539,0:39:14.23,paste with a computer that it's it's

0:39:11.749,0:39:15.97,sort of staggering to to try to remember

0:39:14.239,0:39:19.48,what it was like in the beginning

0:39:15.979,0:39:21.97,putting together a book manuscript I my

0:39:19.489,0:39:24.41,first book manuscript that penguin

0:39:21.979,0:39:25.09,published I mean I that was all typed on

0:39:24.410,0:39:27.94,a typewriter

0:39:25.099,0:39:30.14,without page numbers which are then

0:39:27.949,0:39:32.15,penciled in I thought about winding and

0:39:30.140,0:39:34.03,ballin in typewriter typing in page

0:39:32.150,0:39:36.97,numbers so I thought this is insane and

0:39:34.039,0:39:40.21,drive me nuts so I does it had

0:39:36.979,0:39:42.17,handwritten page numbers on it when I

0:39:40.219,0:39:43.84,put together that book manuscript and

0:39:42.170,0:39:45.76,now of course it's just such a breeze

0:39:43.849,0:39:50.83,that computer will automatically do all

0:39:45.769,0:39:54.70,that stuff for you I don't think that it

0:39:50.839,0:39:57.55,changes much about the way I compose but

0:39:54.709,0:40:02.34,there are some I

0:39:57.559,0:40:04.57,I think extraordinary is a big bug

0:40:02.349,0:40:07.21,there's some great advantages about

0:40:04.579,0:40:11.34,seeing it on the screen in the computer

0:40:07.219,0:40:14.79,there's a poem in anatomy and melancholy

0:40:11.349,0:40:14.79,that is

0:40:18.259,0:40:28.10,idiot let me find it

0:40:23.209,0:40:32.57,it's called earthquake light let's see

0:40:28.109,0:40:32.86,it one two three four five six seven

0:40:32.579,0:40:37.97,eight

0:40:32.869,0:40:40.28,turrets since 24 line originally and the

0:40:37.979,0:40:43.43,first draft in this formuoli dress in

0:40:40.289,0:40:46.19,this moment was in six quatrains not

0:40:43.439,0:40:48.26,metrons different about it and if you

0:40:46.199,0:40:50.48,look at it when it was divided into

0:40:48.269,0:40:51.50,quadrant more or less the same structure

0:40:50.489,0:40:53.60,than it is now

0:40:51.509,0:40:55.25,the first quatrain ended with a period

0:40:53.609,0:40:57.35,that is to say that the period at the

0:40:55.259,0:41:02.51,end of he has now line one stands at two

0:40:57.359,0:41:04.89,and I looked at it on the page on the

0:41:02.519,0:41:08.42,computer screen for a long time before I

0:41:04.890,0:41:12.23,realized that you know wait a minute I

0:41:08.420,0:41:14.48,sort of liked the idea that I that the

0:41:12.239,0:41:16.31,quatrain the first quatrain ends with

0:41:14.489,0:41:19.38,the period which sort of establishes

0:41:16.319,0:41:21.29,this undeniable hardness of the quatrain

0:41:19.380,0:41:23.81,it's a structural unit but then I

0:41:21.299,0:41:25.38,thought to myself what happens if I

0:41:23.819,0:41:26.84,break this into terse is because like

0:41:25.380,0:41:31.01,it's the same number of lines I can

0:41:26.849,0:41:33.98,great break it into a different number

0:41:31.019,0:41:35.45,of turrets and still have the poem be

0:41:33.989,0:41:37.85,comprised in the same number of lines

0:41:35.459,0:41:39.66,and it changed everything about the poem

0:41:37.859,0:41:42.15,having that poem broken into turrets

0:41:39.660,0:41:45.17,instead of quatrains and that was so

0:41:42.150,0:41:47.99,easy to do and so easy to examine to

0:41:45.179,0:41:50.81,test with the computer I mean just

0:41:47.999,0:41:53.06,backspace here space here yeah return

0:41:50.819,0:41:57.29,here just did that look at it go

0:41:53.069,0:41:59.27,okay bingo and that sort of thing I

0:41:57.299,0:42:01.97,think it is is one of the great things

0:41:59.279,0:42:04.28,that that that part of the technology of

0:42:01.979,0:42:05.99,the computer helps to facilitate it

0:42:04.289,0:42:09.32,allows you to see those possibilities

0:42:05.999,0:42:12.35,should if I'd had to completely retype

0:42:09.329,0:42:14.88,the thing in intercept Cermak what I

0:42:12.359,0:42:15.86,have done it probably I would have done

0:42:14.880,0:42:20.60,it but it would have been a much more

0:42:15.869,0:42:22.79,arduous thing and and it might not have

0:42:20.609,0:42:24.30,occurred to me simply because the so

0:42:22.799,0:42:28.38,voice Alliance is equal

0:42:24.300,0:42:30.06,that I can break so it's it's a that I

0:42:28.380,0:42:34.76,think is one of the great things about

0:42:30.060,0:42:37.83,the technology there are any sort of I

0:42:34.760,0:42:39.75,guess what sort of mode is your revision

0:42:37.830,0:42:41.10,and what if there's a bit of phrasing on

0:42:39.750,0:42:43.08,the books and reading which was your

0:42:41.100,0:42:46.14,primary mode of textual changes it's an

0:42:43.080,0:42:50.58,Englishwoman so and she was sort of

0:42:46.140,0:42:53.16,describing sort of TS Eliot versus Pound

0:42:50.580,0:42:55.71,being CFL opinions were sort of

0:42:53.160,0:42:57.03,subtractive and pounding for de creus

0:42:55.710,0:42:58.59,and that just you know more and more or

0:42:57.030,0:43:00.75,there's also sort of substituted

0:42:58.590,0:43:02.49,substituted sort of mode as well it's a

0:43:00.750,0:43:05.85,one of those fit your mode or is he

0:43:02.490,0:43:08.61,oh I'm subtracting okay absolutely I

0:43:05.850,0:43:10.56,mean I am but I should get if she

0:43:08.610,0:43:13.47,weren't so old and weren't taking care

0:43:10.560,0:43:14.82,of my my father 24/7 I would have my

0:43:13.470,0:43:18.03,mother who always embroidered

0:43:14.820,0:43:20.28,embroidered me a little sample that I

0:43:18.030,0:43:28.80,could hang on the wall that says cutting

0:43:20.280,0:43:31.98,is virtue because it is and and I'm and

0:43:28.800,0:43:34.26,I buy I think I may be part of the

0:43:31.980,0:43:35.07,lineage of poets who sometimes can't

0:43:34.260,0:43:38.76,shut up

0:43:35.070,0:43:40.32,I love Dryden I love Pope but I can only

0:43:38.760,0:43:41.91,take them for about a hundred two

0:43:40.320,0:43:44.22,hundred lines at a time and I got to go

0:43:41.910,0:43:46.23,lie down because they just did not know

0:43:44.220,0:43:47.88,when to be quiet they did not know when

0:43:46.230,0:43:49.89,to shut up

0:43:47.880,0:43:52.86,and they didn't have to who am I to talk

0:43:49.890,0:43:58.08,about them that way except for the fact

0:43:52.860,0:44:02.31,that I'll look at even at homes of

0:43:58.080,0:44:05.34,Pope's and think if this had been cut by

0:44:02.310,0:44:07.17,about a third it would just feel a lot

0:44:05.340,0:44:11.28,more friendly it would just be a lot

0:44:07.170,0:44:12.84,less boring quite honestly and it may

0:44:11.280,0:44:14.79,not have been boring it is not still

0:44:12.840,0:44:16.95,boring to a lot of people but I think -

0:44:14.790,0:44:20.73,I think it's one of the reasons that

0:44:16.950,0:44:23.34,people like Pope probably are just red

0:44:20.730,0:44:25.14,except by academics as as they once

0:44:23.340,0:44:32.77,might have been because there's just so

0:44:25.140,0:44:35.71,much of it so maybe being sort of in

0:44:32.770,0:44:37.18,lineage or of that sort you know like

0:44:35.710,0:44:40.57,people tell me all the time when you

0:44:37.180,0:44:42.43,write long poems mine don't longest my

0:44:40.570,0:44:49.42,favorite has been like 400 lines that's

0:44:42.430,0:44:51.46,puny yeah but I've cut the the longest

0:44:49.420,0:44:53.65,poem in beautiful country is two hundred

0:44:51.460,0:44:57.45,and twenty some odd lines it was eight

0:44:53.650,0:45:00.55,hundred lines long in barely drafts and

0:44:57.450,0:45:03.19,and most of those they rallied prints

0:45:00.550,0:45:08.56,off a long draught and then I'd start

0:45:03.190,0:45:13.99,cutting and I cut 600 lines it's called

0:45:08.560,0:45:15.73,American fear what is there when you're

0:45:13.990,0:45:18.64,revising you have there an intention

0:45:15.730,0:45:21.34,under your vision I mean and along with

0:45:18.640,0:45:23.53,that are you revising towards like Ida

0:45:21.340,0:45:25.87,driven by sounds is given by being

0:45:23.530,0:45:28.48,driven by structure of the poem in

0:45:25.870,0:45:31.54,general or enemy certainly sound figures

0:45:28.480,0:45:37.00,into it I mean that basically also I'll

0:45:31.540,0:45:38.80,see or hear opportunities to to let the

0:45:37.000,0:45:40.87,poem go someplace else it might not have

0:45:38.800,0:45:42.94,gone basically because I hear a

0:45:40.870,0:45:44.77,particular sound that appeals to me or

0:45:42.940,0:45:46.24,see the possibility of substituting a

0:45:44.770,0:45:48.16,word in the subsequent line that can

0:45:46.240,0:45:50.53,pick up that cell I call it sounds

0:45:48.160,0:45:53.20,linkages yeah a lot of people do I think

0:45:50.530,0:45:57.70,Ellen Brian Boyd this first person I

0:45:53.200,0:45:59.71,ever heard use that term but they are no

0:45:57.700,0:46:01.15,sound it's for me a compositional tool I

0:45:59.710,0:46:04.24,have something called the rule of the

0:46:01.150,0:46:07.78,rhyme when I make a sound that I

0:46:04.240,0:46:11.26,particularly like or feel is evocative

0:46:07.780,0:46:13.06,in a line I want to make that sound

0:46:11.260,0:46:15.16,again within the first three or four

0:46:13.060,0:46:16.78,syllables of the subsequent line just to

0:46:15.160,0:46:18.49,see where the poem goes just to see

0:46:16.780,0:46:21.40,where that sound takes me inside the

0:46:18.490,0:46:24.07,code I forgotten the original question

0:46:21.400,0:46:25.42,out of hell I got here I guess like what

0:46:24.070,0:46:27.04,is there an intention behind the

0:46:25.420,0:46:30.84,revision or you just sort of follow well

0:46:27.040,0:46:34.29,I've got I think in sort of most

0:46:30.840,0:46:37.29,fundamental way I'm looking for clarity

0:46:34.290,0:46:37.29,without

0:46:39.570,0:46:44.71,clarity but with the kind of evocative

0:46:41.730,0:46:51.88,simplicity I mean what I really I don't

0:46:44.710,0:46:57.04,want poems to be available down to a to

0:46:51.880,0:46:58.72,a kind of theme I don't but I'm not

0:46:57.040,0:47:01.72,interested in poems that can be sent to

0:46:58.720,0:47:03.40,be about something sure they're about

0:47:01.720,0:47:04.81,something but what they're really about

0:47:03.400,0:47:07.15,is something much more than that

0:47:04.810,0:47:09.28,particular something and what I'm

0:47:07.150,0:47:12.19,looking for is to get at that particular

0:47:09.280,0:47:14.95,something not so much the thing as the

0:47:12.190,0:47:17.38,other thing Tony tony early the fiction

0:47:14.950,0:47:20.02,nonfiction writer talks about all great

0:47:17.380,0:47:22.78,writing being about the thing and the

0:47:20.020,0:47:24.13,other thing and it's the other thing

0:47:22.780,0:47:26.11,that interests me a whole lot more than

0:47:24.130,0:47:28.36,the thing that in the drafting process

0:47:26.110,0:47:30.70,I'm dealing with the thing in the

0:47:28.360,0:47:32.05,revision process when I get seriously

0:47:30.700,0:47:34.39,down to revision I'm dealing with the

0:47:32.050,0:47:37.99,other thing how can I make what this

0:47:34.390,0:47:41.41,poem is after and that what is

0:47:37.990,0:47:43.24,frequently several different ones so how

0:47:41.410,0:47:47.83,can I make those things all work

0:47:43.240,0:47:50.02,together has any of your relationship to

0:47:47.830,0:47:56.14,that sort of idea changed over years of

0:47:50.020,0:47:58.48,course of writing whereas it has it been

0:47:56.140,0:47:59.83,somewhat constant in that or like like

0:47:58.480,0:48:01.18,you just like once you heard you talk

0:47:59.830,0:48:05.11,about it you like oh right that's what

0:48:01.180,0:48:10.81,I've been doing all I have to say okay

0:48:05.110,0:48:12.70,this is sinister ask a question again I

0:48:10.810,0:48:14.59,again I guess you're talking about the

0:48:12.700,0:48:15.91,thing and the other thing is that

0:48:14.590,0:48:17.26,something that once you've said that to

0:48:15.910,0:48:18.82,you you sort of realize that's what

0:48:17.260,0:48:20.56,you've been doing all along or it is

0:48:18.820,0:48:22.30,something that you came to realize you

0:48:20.560,0:48:23.95,came to be practicing it before you were

0:48:22.300,0:48:25.15,doing something else I think it was

0:48:23.950,0:48:28.56,something I'd been doing all along

0:48:25.150,0:48:31.42,without really having that sort of an

0:48:28.560,0:48:33.76,simple way of explaining it her simple

0:48:31.420,0:48:34.84,way of seeing it but I was always after

0:48:33.760,0:48:42.31,dad I mean

0:48:34.840,0:48:46.78,I did I was interviewed by a young woman

0:48:42.310,0:48:49.21,in Scotland who asked me if I could talk

0:48:46.780,0:48:52.39,about what she said with my two or three

0:48:49.210,0:48:56.13,dominant themes and I said I'm sorry

0:48:52.390,0:48:58.57,what I don't know what those are and

0:48:56.130,0:49:00.19,auntie I told her about my and we wound

0:48:58.570,0:49:02.70,up with the long answer talking about my

0:49:00.190,0:49:06.91,discomfort with the idea of theme

0:49:02.700,0:49:09.13,because I it's so it's just a way of

0:49:06.910,0:49:11.56,sort of circumscribing what the poem is

0:49:09.130,0:49:13.39,after drawing a line about what the

0:49:11.560,0:49:15.04,possibilities of the poem might be and

0:49:13.390,0:49:16.60,I'm aligned around that and I'm not

0:49:15.040,0:49:21.91,interested in that image to the poem

0:49:16.600,0:49:26.80,beings big as it can possibly be having

0:49:21.910,0:49:29.41,as many possible readings if you will as

0:49:26.800,0:49:33.97,it as it can have maybe as many possible

0:49:29.410,0:49:35.77,readings as through our readers what do

0:49:33.970,0:49:39.61,world with other people play for

0:49:35.770,0:49:43.33,Eurovision do they play a role not a

0:49:39.610,0:49:49.75,whole lot I have Kim as my principle

0:49:43.330,0:49:52.69,reader and she's knows me so well that

0:49:49.750,0:49:55.54,she can just she can tell when she needs

0:49:52.690,0:50:01.09,to be supportive and can tell when she

0:49:55.540,0:50:02.23,needs to be mean and and sometimes you

0:50:01.090,0:50:07.68,know you need you just need to have a

0:50:02.230,0:50:11.47,kick in the pants but she's also big on

0:50:07.680,0:50:13.27,she's the one who says okay here's what

0:50:11.470,0:50:15.19,you need to open it up right here right

0:50:13.270,0:50:17.29,right in this spot and she's almost

0:50:15.190,0:50:19.36,invariably correct oh yeah you're right

0:50:17.290,0:50:20.74,I need to I need to develop that spot I

0:50:19.360,0:50:23.20,need to go somewhere else I need to

0:50:20.740,0:50:24.94,bring some other kind of an image some

0:50:23.200,0:50:28.84,other kind of a reference a poem as Dick

0:50:24.940,0:50:30.82,Hugo would say is needs to you need to

0:50:28.840,0:50:32.59,write off the subject in that spot he

0:50:30.820,0:50:33.15,would say I always call it just bring in

0:50:32.590,0:50:39.79,a Buick

0:50:33.150,0:50:41.59,Wow which is just my own figure for it

0:50:39.790,0:50:43.08,but that's what it did find something

0:50:41.590,0:50:44.46,extraneous seemingly

0:50:43.089,0:50:47.10,extraneous to bring into the pump so I

0:50:44.469,0:50:48.43,can open it up here okay and so you

0:50:47.109,0:50:50.17,don't like send your poems to other

0:50:48.430,0:50:52.96,writers or have anything like that I

0:50:50.170,0:50:55.45,have a couple of I have a couple of

0:50:52.960,0:50:58.96,friends that I will send poems to on

0:50:55.450,0:51:03.64,occasion Dorian lux's has looked at

0:50:58.960,0:51:06.36,poems for me Henry Carlyle who is only

0:51:03.640,0:51:08.07,important a wonderful poet on a couple

0:51:06.369,0:51:11.14,of occasions Phil Levine has looked at

0:51:08.079,0:51:14.31,some things for me but mostly no I don't

0:51:11.140,0:51:16.26,I don't I don't I don't have that kind

0:51:14.319,0:51:17.95,of network of other writers any sort of

0:51:16.269,0:51:21.96,more unusual circumstances what drives

0:51:17.950,0:51:26.17,you to sort of spend a poem out outside

0:51:21.960,0:51:32.97,whether it will be a comb that for some

0:51:26.170,0:51:35.41,reason or another I'm uncertain of the

0:51:32.979,0:51:38.55,other the example that occurs to me is

0:51:35.410,0:51:40.86,the law a long sequence of poems called

0:51:38.559,0:51:43.86,earthing meditations which originally

0:51:40.869,0:51:46.08,appeared as kind of a little preparatory

0:51:43.869,0:51:51.13,sections in each of the four parts and

0:51:46.089,0:51:53.38,then a fifth envoy sort of the

0:51:51.130,0:51:57.96,organizing poems in the book rain of

0:51:53.380,0:52:00.67,snakes yeah which is a very sound driven

0:51:57.960,0:52:03.72,intensely meditative poem that I wrote I

0:52:00.670,0:52:08.22,mean I was on I was on a Guggenheim when

0:52:03.729,0:52:11.38,I wrote that that book and that was the

0:52:08.229,0:52:13.39,last poem that big poems that went into

0:52:11.380,0:52:14.89,the book because something was missing

0:52:13.390,0:52:16.23,I knew something was missing but I

0:52:14.890,0:52:17.61,didn't know what it was right in the

0:52:16.239,0:52:20.91,middle of the book is this other long

0:52:17.619,0:52:24.70,sequence called rain of snakes yeah and

0:52:20.910,0:52:27.57,I had this one poem which was actually

0:52:24.700,0:52:30.09,the first part of earthly meditations I

0:52:27.579,0:52:31.90,took it in to live to show it to Kim and

0:52:30.099,0:52:34.26,she said okay this stanza here needs to

0:52:31.900,0:52:36.54,go but you might want to consider just

0:52:34.269,0:52:37.86,writing more of this see how cuz I don't

0:52:36.549,0:52:40.56,feel like it's done

0:52:37.869,0:52:41.95,and so I wrote this you know it's five

0:52:40.569,0:52:45.36,hundred some-odd lines long this

0:52:41.950,0:52:48.78,sequence over the course of like two

0:52:45.369,0:52:50.34,weeks but Allah while I would do it I

0:52:48.789,0:52:54.09,would go out and

0:52:50.340,0:52:57.24,I'd play Dylan Thomas on on the sand I

0:52:54.090,0:53:00.00,just listen to him say this gorgeous

0:52:57.240,0:53:02.16,nonsense is often called it or I'd read

0:53:00.000,0:53:06.24,Plath or and read the book of nightmares

0:53:02.160,0:53:09.05,mostly I was if as a model for that poem

0:53:06.240,0:53:12.36,it was read Keys North American sequence

0:53:09.050,0:53:16.95,very much nature driven sort of sort of

0:53:12.360,0:53:18.99,thing and highly musical and then I when

0:53:16.950,0:53:21.69,I when I finished it I knew what I

0:53:18.990,0:53:23.58,wanted to do with it and put it use it

0:53:21.690,0:53:26.28,as sections throughout the book actually

0:53:23.580,0:53:30.87,that was Kim's idea - I couldn't write

0:53:26.280,0:53:32.79,without her but I mean I I did I didn't

0:53:30.870,0:53:34.47,really trust the poem I was this not

0:53:32.790,0:53:37.44,like anything else I've ever written so

0:53:34.470,0:53:40.20,I sent it to Dorian and Henry and Phil

0:53:37.440,0:53:43.23,and a couple of other people just to

0:53:40.200,0:53:46.17,find out all of whom one of them Henry

0:53:43.230,0:53:47.82,who was a student of Ricky's it was too

0:53:46.170,0:53:49.26,close to read key for couldn't he

0:53:47.820,0:53:51.18,couldn't really didn't want me to do it

0:53:49.260,0:53:52.50,everybody else said is the best thing

0:53:51.180,0:53:53.97,you've ever written you just got to keep

0:53:52.500,0:53:55.50,reading more like that people keep

0:53:53.970,0:53:57.24,telling me and it'll back and get that

0:53:55.500,0:53:59.28,voice again and do more and I keep

0:53:57.240,0:53:59.97,saying already done it I want to do that

0:53:59.280,0:54:02.67,anymore

0:53:59.970,0:54:05.91,yes but I did you know I do have those

0:54:02.670,0:54:09.63,those those people I haven't used any of

0:54:05.910,0:54:11.73,them Henry a couple times since but

0:54:09.630,0:54:13.41,that's been about it I don't really and

0:54:11.730,0:54:16.47,I have this weekend writer-in-residence

0:54:13.410,0:54:19.44,and you're they say that means who's

0:54:16.470,0:54:21.75,extremely helpful are you talking a

0:54:19.440,0:54:23.55,little bit about I mean these it is like

0:54:21.750,0:54:25.59,how this goes into a book and everything

0:54:23.550,0:54:27.90,and I guess I'm wondering he could sort

0:54:25.590,0:54:29.70,of delineate a difference between how

0:54:27.900,0:54:32.15,you provide an individual piece and how

0:54:29.700,0:54:34.44,you revise a collection of works and

0:54:32.150,0:54:36.68,maybe talk a little bit about how that

0:54:34.440,0:54:42.33,has changed over the course of years

0:54:36.680,0:54:46.86,yeah the you know it's such an ongoing

0:54:42.330,0:54:49.38,thing with individual pieces a lot of

0:54:46.860,0:54:51.84,times I'll publish a poem in a magazine

0:54:49.380,0:54:53.13,and I'll go back in and think I want to

0:54:51.840,0:54:54.09,change this and I'll change something

0:54:53.130,0:54:55.92,I'll fiddle with

0:54:54.090,0:54:57.51,a little bit I don't think there's

0:54:55.920,0:54:59.70,anything particularly holy about the

0:54:57.510,0:55:03.81,fact that it appeared in print in one

0:54:59.700,0:55:05.52,way I can tinker with it but then I find

0:55:03.810,0:55:07.77,when I start assembling a book and I

0:55:05.520,0:55:10.17,mean I still do this the old-fashioned

0:55:07.770,0:55:14.22,way I don't think any other way as I get

0:55:10.170,0:55:16.71,all the poems I think might comprise the

0:55:14.220,0:55:18.93,poem I lay him out on the floor but then

0:55:16.710,0:55:21.81,that act of laying them out on the floor

0:55:18.930,0:55:24.84,and finding say located this batch of

0:55:21.810,0:55:26.64,1012 poems sort of goes together you can

0:55:24.840,0:55:28.62,see there there's some connective tissue

0:55:26.640,0:55:30.99,between them then I've got to go back

0:55:28.620,0:55:33.45,and start making and I have a system of

0:55:30.990,0:55:36.48,little arrows and checks and numbers and

0:55:33.450,0:55:40.83,so forth that show me opportunities to

0:55:36.480,0:55:44.55,tie those poems together and if I write

0:55:40.830,0:55:46.65,as as in say anatomy of melancholy a

0:55:44.550,0:55:48.72,book that's in four sections then I have

0:55:46.650,0:55:52.65,to find a way to connect the sections

0:55:48.720,0:55:55.02,together so that the assemblage of the

0:55:52.650,0:55:56.46,sections is part of the assemblage of

0:55:55.020,0:55:58.35,the whole of course but the assemblage

0:55:56.460,0:56:00.63,of the hole and the sections there n

0:55:58.350,0:56:02.94,becomes also the part of the revision of

0:56:00.630,0:56:04.83,the individual poems as I find ways to

0:56:02.940,0:56:09.09,stitch those things together in the

0:56:04.830,0:56:13.02,larger fabric and that has been assisted

0:56:09.090,0:56:16.44,throughout oh yeah oh yeah from from

0:56:13.020,0:56:20.37,certainly from from my second book on my

0:56:16.440,0:56:26.04,first book which Copper Canyon published

0:56:20.370,0:56:28.74,in 1979 was my MFA thesis basically and

0:56:26.040,0:56:32.25,you know you when I find copies in

0:56:28.740,0:56:35.10,bookstores I buy them I'm not

0:56:32.250,0:56:37.41,embarrassed by it but boy it's it's it's

0:56:35.100,0:56:39.99,really beginning of work and various I

0:56:37.410,0:56:41.97,think in the selected poems I use maybe

0:56:39.990,0:56:43.23,three poems and even then I think I

0:56:41.970,0:56:45.69,could have left them on it wouldn't hurt

0:56:43.230,0:56:48.89,anything but my editor said Donna you

0:56:45.690,0:56:53.07,got to have something okay

0:56:48.890,0:56:55.25,so begin to know what the second book

0:56:53.070,0:56:56.88,moon in a mason jar that's spinning

0:56:55.250,0:56:59.40,absolutely the way I

0:56:56.880,0:57:04.44,I've operated it's gotten complicated

0:56:59.400,0:57:08.27,with two in the books my third book what

0:57:04.440,0:57:11.09,my father believed and beautiful country

0:57:08.279,0:57:18.18,which our volumes not divided into

0:57:11.099,0:57:20.64,sections so that each of I mean it seems

0:57:18.180,0:57:24.23,more all of a piece somehow and that

0:57:20.640,0:57:25.61,those required a lot more movement about

0:57:24.239,0:57:28.76,how I could have done without the

0:57:25.619,0:57:32.74,computer moving poems and in different

0:57:28.769,0:57:38.54,locations throughout the text and

0:57:32.749,0:57:40.25,finding ways to to maintain a kind of

0:57:38.549,0:57:42.50,seamlessness but not a kind of

0:57:40.259,0:57:44.27,overwhelming sense of their being in arc

0:57:42.509,0:57:46.73,because they're really it is a

0:57:44.279,0:57:50.72,collection of poems there if there's an

0:57:46.739,0:57:53.46,arc it's it's boy it's a very pale arc

0:57:50.729,0:57:57.35,at least in those those two books of

0:57:53.460,0:57:58.52,mine we talked a little bit latest set

0:57:57.359,0:58:01.41,to me about assisting with arrows and

0:57:58.529,0:58:04.44,numbers and 186 maybe go into the

0:58:01.410,0:58:07.07,nitty-gritty of it well it might be

0:58:04.440,0:58:08.84,sometimes it's like we'll have to do

0:58:07.079,0:58:10.65,with page numbers although I'll have the

0:58:08.849,0:58:15.15,draft and I'll put page numbers on then

0:58:10.650,0:58:17.24,I'll just have an asterisk and seven

0:58:15.150,0:58:21.42,which will mean look for the asterisk on

0:58:17.249,0:58:23.54,page seven or or asked are a check 1:1,
0:58:21.420,0:58:26.24,look at 118 and and and I'll have

0:58:23.549,0:58:28.68,another check so they're a couple spots

0:58:26.249,0:58:30.83,in a couple of poems that correspond

0:58:28.680,0:58:33.52,that can allow me to make a stitch here

0:58:30.839,0:58:37.44,that connects those two things so across

0:58:33.529,0:58:39.32,2 or 50 pages there's there's a kind of

0:58:37.440,0:58:42.04,communication that's going on through

0:58:39.329,0:58:45.42,the whole of the manuscript yes and then

0:58:42.049,0:58:46.89,once you how do you then you just

0:58:45.420,0:58:49.31,combined them all into one for

0:58:46.890,0:58:50.91,documentary computers mm-hmm yeah and

0:58:49.319,0:58:52.92,before them you know when it had to be

0:58:50.910,0:58:55.82,typed up then it was and it was really

0:58:52.920,0:58:56.67,hard so I had to do a lot of penciling

0:58:55.829,0:59:01.74,of thing

0:58:56.670,0:59:04.16,in somewhere in those many boxes in the

0:59:01.740,0:59:07.14,closet in the basement or are like

0:59:04.160,0:59:10.44,drafts worksheets whatever you want to

0:59:07.140,0:59:14.06,call them versions of all of the books

0:59:10.440,0:59:17.01,since since moon in a mason jar that

0:59:14.069,0:59:18.08,that sort of show that process how that

0:59:17.010,0:59:22.14,how that came about

0:59:18.089,0:59:23.88,yeah and have you now that you do use a

0:59:22.140,0:59:25.38,computer did it do you find yourself

0:59:23.880,0:59:27.72,making any changes of the collection

0:59:25.380,0:59:29.94,once it's gone into bigger file oh

0:59:27.720,0:59:32.36,absolutely I mean it doesn't it never

0:59:29.940,0:59:36.00,really stops once I get it in this in

0:59:32.369,0:59:40.77,the file I'm sure I I one welcome

0:59:36.000,0:59:42.72,anatomy of melancholy I thought I had

0:59:40.770,0:59:45.21,exact I thought I had it exactly the way

0:59:42.720,0:59:47.46,I wanted it but the first poem in the

0:59:45.210,0:59:48.96,published book used to be the last poem

0:59:47.460,0:59:50.76,in the published book in the last poem

0:59:48.960,0:59:53.94,in the published book used to the first

0:59:50.760,0:59:56.63,and I just thought to myself and they

0:59:53.940,1:00:00.24,were that way because there's a kind of

0:59:56.630,1:00:02.97,this kind of chronic chronology there in

1:00:00.240,1:00:06.03,a way the third the last poem in the

1:00:02.970,1:00:07.95,book happens before the first poem in

1:00:06.030,1:00:10.61,the book if you know what I mean seems

1:00:07.950,1:00:13.34,like so chronologically it seemed better

1:00:10.619,1:00:16.29,that that that what is now the last poem

1:00:13.349,1:00:17.97,happened first but I got to working on

1:00:16.290,1:00:19.55,and realizing and a lot of it had to do

1:00:17.970,1:00:25.17,with form to the last poem in the book

1:00:19.559,1:00:26.76,is asana the as it stands now which

1:00:25.170,1:00:28.34,seemed like a great way into the book

1:00:26.760,1:00:32.09,but in fact it seems to me like a much

1:00:28.349,1:00:34.61,better way out of the book so I still

1:00:32.099,1:00:36.80,make those kinds of changes and and I

1:00:34.619,1:00:39.14,mean about my drive my poor copy editor

1:00:36.809,1:00:42.27,crazy at penguin because they're always

1:00:39.140,1:00:44.84,yeah okay I changed this you're right

1:00:42.270,1:00:46.41,that the Tom was probably confusing or I

1:00:44.849,1:00:48.96,oughta had a comma there but by the way

1:00:46.410,1:00:51.42,I've added two more lines we need you to

1:00:48.960,1:00:54.93,I need you to put in or I've taken out

1:00:51.420,1:00:59.75,of line and yeah and I wish you will

1:00:54.930,1:00:59.75,this ever stop I think

1:01:01.490,1:01:07.88,so I get some sort of I mean we're sort

1:01:04.550,1:01:09.61,of on to sort of how you organize you

1:01:07.880,1:01:11.24,move in from revision you're always

1:01:09.619,1:01:12.65,revising the drill but then you're also

1:01:11.240,1:01:15.61,sort of moving into organizing the

1:01:12.650,1:01:17.03,collection and then I guess once you you

1:01:15.619,1:01:19.84,know once you're at that point that you

1:01:17.030,1:01:22.52,know you've got published collections

1:01:19.849,1:01:26.90,you've got published poems how do you

1:01:22.520,1:01:28.84,kind of keep track of all this stuff and

1:01:26.900,1:01:30.58,do you do it on the computer or do you

1:01:28.849,1:01:31.91,get means like I know before the

1:01:30.589,1:01:34.46,computer and fear is a little different

1:01:31.910,1:01:36.08,than it was now but or maybe it hasn't

1:01:34.460,1:01:37.88,changed at all I don't think it has

1:01:36.080,1:01:43.82,changed at all I mean there was a time

1:01:37.880,1:01:46.40,when I would create a file on the

1:01:43.820,1:01:50.65,computer that was nothing but poems that

1:01:46.400,1:01:53.27,had been published in magazines say and

1:01:50.650,1:01:57.34,then I just got away from that and and

1:01:53.270,1:01:59.96,sort of went old-fashioned on myself and

1:01:57.349,1:02:02.99,just started writing them down yeah and

1:01:59.960,1:02:06.65,keeping them in the file I don't know

1:02:02.990,1:02:10.94,why I did that it just seems like hard

1:02:06.650,1:02:13.58,copies it was a lot easier to get to the

1:02:10.940,1:02:15.41,hard copy somehow and and look at them

1:02:13.580,1:02:17.18,and see how they and read them that it

1:02:15.410,1:02:19.42,was to call up individual poems out of a

1:02:17.180,1:02:22.82,whole lot of file yeah

1:02:19.420,1:02:25.40,so and to that extent I guess I

1:02:22.820,1:02:29.81,discovered that I preferred easily the

1:02:25.400,1:02:34.16,old and seemingly laborious manual

1:02:29.810,1:02:37.94,method were seriously digital analog not

1:02:34.160,1:02:40.07,digital analog method of of notation and

1:02:37.940,1:02:42.44,keeping track of things yeah I mean

1:02:40.070,1:02:46.46,there's no doubt that that for me it's

1:02:42.440,1:02:49.84,got to be a combination of the two even

1:02:46.460,1:02:52.40,still I mean I've got almost all the I

1:02:49.849,1:02:55.40,had to scrounge around for a pen to sign

1:02:52.400,1:02:57.34,their papers with but I've got pencils

1:02:55.400,1:02:59.63,all over the place because that's what I

1:02:57.349,1:03:02.33,need to write in in these things with

1:02:59.630,1:03:04.60,and then your other folder they're what

1:03:02.330,1:03:06.13,you call that a thesis holder so when

1:03:04.609,1:03:10.97,did you start using those

1:03:06.130,1:03:13.96,that was in Montana baya they Matylda

1:03:10.970,1:03:16.40,fries gave all her students one of those

1:03:13.960,1:03:19.46,which is a very sweet thing and I loved

1:03:16.400,1:03:21.17,it and then and Rodney Jones that

1:03:19.460,1:03:23.24,actually talks about these things they

1:03:21.170,1:03:24.61,are bird calls them thesis binders so

1:03:23.240,1:03:26.08,you can buy them in the bookstore and

1:03:24.619,1:03:28.94,harbor but I've never come and you can

1:03:26.089,1:03:31.11,buy them in the bookstore at Montana but

1:03:28.940,1:03:34.46,I've never had to order these online now

1:03:31.119,1:03:36.28,they're also called spring binders and

1:03:34.460,1:03:38.29,at Montana when I was in graduate school

1:03:36.289,1:03:39.98,with you you had a spring binder to keep

1:03:38.299,1:03:42.61,your poems and you just weren't shit you

1:03:39.980,1:03:49.94,I mean you know you it was you were what

1:03:42.619,1:03:51.52,your spring binder man I have one oh so

1:03:49.940,1:03:54.44,I got ya I got sort of I got sort of

1:03:51.529,1:03:56.99,interested in in that particular thing

1:03:54.440,1:03:59.48,way back then and I've got well in those

1:03:56.990,1:04:01.13,boxes are hundreds of them and I got a

1:03:59.480,1:04:03.50,couple of old ones here that went held

1:04:01.130,1:04:05.48,together with duct tape and that's a big

1:04:03.500,1:04:07.64,one I think that's one Kim retired

1:04:05.480,1:04:10.60,friend from a prose manuscript so that I

1:04:07.640,1:04:11.86,could but I could do the selected

1:04:10.609,1:04:12.31,columns in because it was kind of a

1:04:11.869,1:04:17.96,fatty

1:04:12.319,1:04:20.11,oh yeah Harrison okay how does it work

1:04:17.960,1:04:22.33,what is it like does it could be oh yeah

1:04:20.119,1:04:24.58,this visual page it's gotta know it's

1:04:22.339,1:04:28.29,got it's got metal in here ooh this

1:04:24.589,1:04:30.98,one's not pinning you you have to

1:04:28.299,1:04:33.41,squeeze it see the silence and metal in

1:04:30.980,1:04:36.61,DES it was fine then it's got this

1:04:33.410,1:04:40.06,little ended its intended your favorite

1:04:36.619,1:04:44.21,yeah yeah it's just a pile and there's

1:04:40.069,1:04:46.73,no particular order in this I mean these

1:04:44.210,1:04:48.89,are all these are all Dan there's a

1:04:46.730,1:04:51.26,prose poem in stanzas okay

1:04:48.890,1:04:54.01,it's which is not not possible but I did

1:04:51.260,1:04:57.30,it you know and then back in the back

1:04:54.010,1:04:57.30,here this

1:04:57.680,1:05:04.27,about that many poems that have already

1:05:00.440,1:05:07.88,been published and maybe a few more in

1:05:04.279,1:05:11.93,in journals yeah quite a few more

1:05:07.880,1:05:14.48,actually yeah that's so that's my

1:05:11.930,1:05:17.24,finally yeah that's how I'm keep that

1:05:14.480,1:05:19.96,that that's either things that have been

1:05:17.240,1:05:22.36,published and therefore might be

1:05:19.960,1:05:25.72,serviceable in a collection somewhere

1:05:22.369,1:05:28.25,down the road or poems that are still

1:05:25.720,1:05:29.66,under construction and then there's kind

1:05:28.250,1:05:31.06,of an intermediary thing although

1:05:29.660,1:05:33.47,they're all jumbled together I don't

1:05:31.069,1:05:36.47,know which is which I have to keep okay

1:05:33.470,1:05:38.63,I'll do this on on computer yeah this

1:05:36.470,1:05:42.23,began this is my submission notebook

1:05:38.630,1:05:44.83,things where I submitted things accepted

1:05:42.230,1:05:49.18,see I see five points I've been doing

1:05:44.839,1:05:53.79,that for years I started 1995 and and

1:05:49.180,1:05:56.15,Jack and most recently I sent a batch to

1:05:53.799,1:06:02.04,send those well the Georgia review and

1:05:56.150,1:06:07.05,Smithsonian wanted to see if all Lizzie

1:06:02.049,1:06:07.05,so then I guess overall that if we can

1:06:14.570,1:06:27.34,I hope you can hear that insult yeah

1:06:26.750,1:06:32.59,I'll be fine

1:06:27.340,1:06:36.83,um I dunno

1:06:32.590,1:06:37.52,um okay so we're really good thank you

1:06:36.830,1:06:41.24,um

1:06:37.520,1:06:44.96,so I guess so we've seen a fetus finder

1:06:41.240,1:06:46.37,and you have been six years of them over

1:06:44.960,1:06:48.20,there another years of notebooks and

1:06:46.370,1:06:49.76,years of theses finders and these how

1:06:48.200,1:06:51.11,are you fucks with organizing that media

1:06:49.760,1:06:52.79,sort of sticking them to one side yeah

1:06:51.110,1:06:54.98,they're not in any well they are in a

1:06:52.790,1:06:59.15,kind of order they go most recent to

1:06:54.980,1:07:02.15,most to be oldest um on the bottom of

1:06:59.150,1:07:04.55,the pile but they get shuffled because I

1:07:02.150,1:07:06.38,go back in and pull them out I mean it

1:07:04.550,1:07:08.57,really is the kind of storage kind of

1:07:06.380,1:07:11.33,information retrieval system it just

1:07:08.570,1:07:14.48,happens to be handwritten and old

1:07:11.330,1:07:18.23,fashions because I love going back I can

1:07:14.480,1:07:22.01,go back 25 years and pull out a notebook

1:07:18.230,1:07:23.90,and and sometimes make discoveries you

1:07:22.010,1:07:26.45,know that this was interesting how come

1:07:23.900,1:07:28.73,I didn't finish this one what slips it

1:07:26.450,1:07:30.89,was alone more often than not I wasn't

1:07:28.730,1:07:33.59,capable of finishing it I'd got onto

1:07:30.890,1:07:36.59,something I didn't quite have the

1:07:33.590,1:07:40.67,know-how or or the resourcefulness to

1:07:36.590,1:07:43.52,find a way out of and now you know

1:07:40.670,1:07:47.51,either I do or I've convinced myself

1:07:43.520,1:07:52.01,right right so I I I get it back out and

1:07:47.510,1:07:54.50,go to work on it and then so that the

1:07:52.010,1:07:57.02,difference between there's boxes as well

1:07:54.500,1:07:58.67,right yeah and both stood by the time I

1:07:57.020,1:08:01.16,put stuff in boxes that's pretty well

1:07:58.670,1:08:03.79,committed to the closet a lot much

1:08:01.160,1:08:06.23,interested in pulling things out okay

1:08:03.790,1:08:08.60,but I do that's one of the reasons why I

1:08:06.230,1:08:10.55,have this tray down here this wooden

1:08:08.600,1:08:12.38,tray where things go in and I'll bring

1:08:10.550,1:08:16.31,another one of those manuscript boxes

1:08:12.380,1:08:21.31,out or it usually holds ten reams of

1:08:16.310,1:08:23.52,paper right before these things that

1:08:21.319,1:08:26.25,this pile of things goes into

1:08:23.529,1:08:27.33,that box I go through a poem by Palmer

1:08:26.259,1:08:28.86,draft by draft

1:08:27.339,1:08:30.36,I don't organize them but I look for

1:08:28.869,1:08:33.30,something oh yeah I forgot about this

1:08:30.369,1:08:35.10,because sometimes it will be I know it's

1:08:33.309,1:08:38.25,on the computer somewhere prowling

1:08:35.109,1:08:42.96,remember it and you know if I just go to

1:08:38.259,1:08:45.30,to word and open it's just chaos right

1:08:42.969,1:08:47.92,it's just a whole lot of files some of

1:08:45.309,1:08:49.59,them are not called dad anymore so but I

1:08:47.920,1:08:51.21,can do I can do a search I can type a

1:08:49.599,1:08:54.21,line and do a search and find it

1:08:51.219,1:08:56.88,somewhere but I would not even remember

1:08:54.219,1:08:59.31,to what it might have been called unless

1:08:56.889,1:09:03.88,I find something in this batch before it

1:08:59.319,1:09:06.19,goes in the box so I try to try not to

1:09:03.880,1:09:10.86,lose anything but it keeping track of

1:09:06.190,1:09:14.13,it's it's hard yeah and I write a lot

1:09:10.869,1:09:16.05,right and then I guess I mean we didn't

1:09:14.139,1:09:18.30,talk about that ago some questions later

1:09:16.059,1:09:20.13,better outside and out how do you mean

1:09:18.309,1:09:22.82,your files and your folders how do you

1:09:20.139,1:09:28.27,organize your stuff on the computer

1:09:22.829,1:09:30.15,minimally minimally minor you give

1:09:28.270,1:09:35.28,usually just a title and sometimes I'll

1:09:30.159,1:09:37.90,have I mean I've got like exactly

1:09:35.289,1:09:40.11,there's a poem called ant and I've got

1:09:37.900,1:09:43.15,ant one and two and three because I'm

1:09:40.119,1:09:44.92,not sure which of those drafts I prefer

1:09:43.150,1:09:47.40,I kind of like something about them all

1:09:44.920,1:09:51.48,it may be that eventually I'll get to a

1:09:47.409,1:09:55.15,a final version of that poem called ant

1:09:51.489,1:09:56.73,and eliminate the others or print them

1:09:55.150,1:09:58.23,off put them in a box and eliminate them

1:09:56.739,1:10:00.19,from the hard drive just get rid of them

1:09:58.239,1:10:03.76,so they don't they don't clutter up or

1:10:00.190,1:10:06.61,gift and get in the way but I'm not I'm

1:10:03.760,1:10:09.09,not all that resourceful with the

1:10:06.610,1:10:11.17,computer I think that you know a lot of

1:10:09.099,1:10:14.80,people are much more resourceful with it

1:10:11.170,1:10:16.57,isn't as a tool so I don't tend to to do

1:10:14.800,1:10:18.80,a lot of organization it's just where I

1:10:16.570,1:10:20.60,store individual poems for the

1:10:18.800,1:10:22.40,part so there's a a poem on your

1:10:20.600,1:10:25.37,particular title and that's it or

1:10:22.400,1:10:28.34,there's a manuscript under a particular

1:10:25.370,1:10:31.25,title or though now and this has got

1:10:28.340,1:10:35.44,particularly strange because so many

1:10:31.250,1:10:38.69,magazines are accepting submissions

1:10:35.440,1:10:41.57,online yeah you find you have to

1:10:38.690,1:10:44.75,assemble another file consisting of

1:10:41.570,1:10:46.70,three or four or five poems to sin which

1:10:44.750,1:10:48.58,also gets complicated - you have this

1:10:46.700,1:10:51.77,other whole set of files so I am

1:10:48.580,1:10:53.72,individual poems here I have batches of

1:10:51.770,1:10:55.64,poems that have been submitted over here

1:10:53.720,1:10:57.92,and after a while I'll just dump those

1:10:55.640,1:11:00.05,it was I've still got the other I've

1:10:57.920,1:11:02.63,still got the poems so I can tell me

1:11:00.050,1:11:07.76,well fit is the kind of Master File yes

1:11:02.630,1:11:12.29,yes and you don't ever have like Ian to

1:11:07.760,1:11:17.12,orient revise drink no no I do when I

1:11:12.290,1:11:19.28,lose track of I mean most of these are

1:11:17.120,1:11:25.58,two or three drafts that's let's see

1:11:19.280,1:11:27.32,that's number one number three and

1:11:25.580,1:11:29.42,really most leads our first graph still

1:11:27.320,1:11:32.60,early on here but I'll give you an get

1:11:29.420,1:11:41.21,back in here and find like four five

1:11:32.600,1:11:42.95,seven eight and and all and then you go

1:11:41.210,1:11:44.84,back through here and you end and go

1:11:42.950,1:11:49.34,they'll be poems in which they're you

1:11:44.840,1:11:51.29,know draft number 22 and eventually once

1:11:49.340,1:11:52.61,I decide that that's done then again it

1:11:51.290,1:11:54.65,goes into the computer is the kind of

1:11:52.610,1:11:56.12,final draft that's just the final poem

1:11:54.650,1:12:00.25,as it stands there and I'll eliminate

1:11:56.120,1:12:00.25,anything else that existed along the way

1:12:00.730,1:12:06.59,just to keep the old hard drive from

1:12:02.870,1:12:08.48,being cluttered up yeah and make and

1:12:06.590,1:12:10.85,make to just to make it easier to find

1:12:08.480,1:12:12.02,things when I want to know that's one of

1:12:10.850,1:12:14.36,those data

1:12:12.020,1:12:18.83,trying to figure out what was done and

1:12:14.360,1:12:19.76,and how you did it in so it's going to

1:12:18.830,1:12:22.31,bring you this to the end of this

1:12:19.760,1:12:23.93,section of questions and I want to ask

1:12:22.310,1:12:26.36,kind of add some sort of more pointed

1:12:23.930,1:12:30.02,questions about computer and using

1:12:26.360,1:12:33.05,correspondence and but I guess overall

1:12:30.020,1:12:35.81,can you do you see any distinct stages

1:12:33.050,1:12:38.45,in your writing process you see over the

1:12:35.810,1:12:40.67,course of your career you see like

1:12:38.450,1:12:45.32,distinct shifts or do you sort of see it

1:12:40.670,1:12:49.40,as a gradual change or not change orders

1:12:45.320,1:12:52.43,or staying the same as well I think III

1:12:49.400,1:12:58.73,I think there was one huge sort of shift

1:12:52.430,1:13:00.71,and that was when I moved from actually

1:12:58.730,1:13:01.91,going to change publishers when I second

1:13:00.710,1:13:05.42,two books came from the University of

1:13:01.910,1:13:08.72,Illinois press and I had this kind of

1:13:05.420,1:13:10.19,storybook thing that happened that I

1:13:08.720,1:13:12.62,gave a reading in a Writers Conference

1:13:10.190,1:13:15.44,at which there were the president of

1:13:12.620,1:13:18.37,Viking was there and the director of

1:13:15.440,1:13:22.36,publicity who is now my editor who is

1:13:18.370,1:13:26.57,famous I mean II edited Eat Pray Love uh

1:13:22.360,1:13:31.49,he he's TC Boyle's editor Paul slovic

1:13:26.570,1:13:33.74,and he was there and I gave this reading

1:13:31.490,1:13:37.79,and and the president of Viking came up

1:13:33.740,1:13:40.16,and said do you have a book I said why I

1:13:37.790,1:13:42.83,I got to start on what I'm working on

1:13:40.160,1:13:44.45,Linus send me what you got I sent him

1:13:42.830,1:13:50.00,six poems in the title of what I

1:13:44.450,1:13:51.83,perceived the book this book and three

1:13:50.000,1:13:55.88,weeks later I had an offer in a contract

1:13:51.830,1:13:57.41,in an envelope and a delivery date and I

1:13:55.880,1:14:01.01,called and I got the delivery date

1:13:57.410,1:14:04.31,extended six months and and bingo I was

1:14:01.010,1:14:07.19,on well that's sort of been the way I've

1:14:04.310,1:14:12.08,worked with penguin ever since when I

1:14:07.190,1:14:14.36,when I when I know what the book is

1:14:12.080,1:14:17.69,going to be when I have this sort of

1:14:14.360,1:14:19.38,abstract but nevertheless certain sense

1:14:17.690,1:14:21.21,that this is

1:14:19.380,1:14:22.38,the book is going to be this is how it's

1:14:21.210,1:14:25.92,going to work what it's going to revolve

1:14:22.380,1:14:28.02,around this is what the title is I'd

1:14:25.920,1:14:30.12,send my now I send the editor an email

1:14:28.020,1:14:31.77,and say well suppose could be called

1:14:30.120,1:14:38.10,anatomy of melancholy and other poems

1:14:31.770,1:14:42.45,I'd like to deliver in spring 2012 okay

1:14:38.100,1:14:47.73,he says and then they send me a contract

1:14:42.450,1:14:51.48,okay it's a you know yeah it's a it's

1:14:47.730,1:14:55.28,it's a pretty good deal but it you know

1:14:51.480,1:14:58.65,it's it's sort of a big shift because

1:14:55.280,1:15:02.10,it's from that point on I have not had

1:14:58.650,1:15:05.67,to worry about finding a publisher and

1:15:02.100,1:15:08.28,that's just a great luxury Seattle yeah

1:15:05.670,1:15:12.18,and so I can I can not pay attention to

1:15:08.280,1:15:14.34,so much of the sort of the professional

1:15:12.180,1:15:17.16,part is where I tell my students I mean

1:15:14.340,1:15:20.31,your writing is your life your

1:15:17.160,1:15:23.97,publishing is your career you live your

1:15:20.310,1:15:26.19,life you manage your career and

1:15:23.970,1:15:27.96,sometimes those things get so tangled up

1:15:26.190,1:15:30.87,and for some people they get tangled up

1:15:27.960,1:15:32.76,I think much to their detriment both on

1:15:30.870,1:15:35.58,the life side maybe less so on the

1:15:32.760,1:15:37.97,career side but they get all knotted

1:15:35.580,1:15:40.08,together and not that way

1:15:37.970,1:15:45.48,I've just been lucky enough that it

1:15:40.080,1:15:48.09,hasn't worked that way for me that was

1:15:45.480,1:15:49.23,called in the bank of beautiful Sam that

1:15:48.090,1:15:50.06,was the first one I did with Pam

1:15:49.230,1:15:56.16,granites

1:15:50.060,1:15:59.55,I've not done six books yeah and my one

1:15:56.160,1:16:01.71,question was that it does it seem I mean

1:15:59.550,1:16:03.30,I want to use the word organic here was

1:16:01.710,1:16:04.98,it more organic when you just kind of

1:16:03.300,1:16:07.41,wrote until you had a book and they

1:16:04.980,1:16:09.42,presented it or does it or actually is

1:16:07.410,1:16:11.22,it different now that you kind of know

1:16:09.420,1:16:14.16,that it's you're guaranteed basically

1:16:11.220,1:16:16.80,yeah yeah it really not worth it is that

1:16:14.160,1:16:20.36,it no no I know what you mean although I

1:16:16.800,1:16:23.67,think that there's something even more

1:16:20.360,1:16:24.35,organic for me about having the vision

1:16:23.670,1:16:26.57,of what

1:16:24.350,1:16:27.98,book is in advance even before I've

1:16:26.570,1:16:30.92,written some of the poems that are going

1:16:27.980,1:16:33.20,to comprise that book because it

1:16:30.920,1:16:35.96,completely changes my focus once I know

1:16:33.200,1:16:38.54,I mean people ask me now are you working

1:16:35.960,1:16:41.60,on a book no I'm just writing poems yeah

1:16:38.540,1:16:44.15,and that's a very serious distinction

1:16:41.600,1:16:46.06,for me and I'm not in any hurry to know

1:16:44.150,1:16:48.83,what the next book is and I just

1:16:46.060,1:16:52.52,published one less than a year ago right

1:16:48.830,1:16:55.19,well yeah so April so it's like seven

1:16:52.520,1:16:57.56,months old so you know it's going to be

1:16:55.190,1:16:59.57,a year or two before I begin to have

1:16:57.560,1:17:01.37,some sense and even then I might just a

1:16:59.570,1:17:06.88,success I really don't need to be in any

1:17:01.370,1:17:10.49,hurry yeah although Random House is now

1:17:06.880,1:17:12.05,penguin Random House and nobody knows

1:17:10.490,1:17:14.03,what that means yeah

1:17:12.050,1:17:16.13,Random House publishes Billy Collins and

1:17:14.030,1:17:18.38,nobody else Putnam publishes Linda

1:17:16.130,1:17:21.05,beards and Cornelius Eady and nobody

1:17:18.380,1:17:23.57,else penguins got a huge list

1:17:21.050,1:17:26.39,Knopf Scott a huge list does one

1:17:23.570,1:17:29.33,publisher need for poetry lists what's

1:17:26.390,1:17:30.74,going to happen yeah so alright good guy

1:17:29.330,1:17:33.95,can have no control over that so I'm

1:17:30.740,1:17:36.26,just I keep doing what I do and if

1:17:33.950,1:17:38.30,things change bummer

1:17:36.260,1:17:40.73,either that or not I don't know it might

1:17:38.300,1:17:43.31,be fine yeah but I do think that it's

1:17:40.730,1:17:45.74,been it really has been and it was that

1:17:43.310,1:17:49.04,first incidence of saying I get this

1:17:45.740,1:17:53.78,great opportunity penguin wants to

1:17:49.040,1:17:57.02,publish a book of mine I can I can make

1:17:53.780,1:17:59.66,this move to a New York house and I

1:17:57.020,1:18:03.77,don't have a book manuscript yet but if

1:17:59.660,1:18:05.78,I can promise to have this book

1:18:03.770,1:18:07.91,manuscript calm this of such-and-such a

1:18:05.780,1:18:12.62,date I'll have it and it works so well

1:18:07.910,1:18:16.79,for me I mean my first three books for

1:18:12.620,1:18:19.01,penguin all won prizes then it cooled

1:18:16.790,1:18:23.27,off that there stay still love me but

1:18:19.010,1:18:29.06,still I need to win another prize I

1:18:23.270,1:18:32.24,guess doing the best I can and if we

1:18:29.060,1:18:34.19,miss or profession will be coming I mean

1:18:32.240,1:18:36.11,it when you have those deadlines is it

1:18:34.190,1:18:37.06,in some way just that much more

1:18:36.110,1:18:39.73,generative

1:18:37.060,1:18:42.82,you don't you can't really have a block

1:18:39.730,1:18:46.12,no I well no and you know my colleague

1:18:42.820,1:18:48.04,Brandon trans yes there's no such thing

1:18:46.120,1:18:49.30,as writer's block if you call a plumber

1:18:48.040,1:18:52.15,he's not going to tell you I got

1:18:49.300,1:18:54.34,plumbers block I can't help you and and

1:18:52.150,1:18:56.50,we ought to be as be able to be as

1:18:54.340,1:18:59.07,professional about it as a plumber is I

1:18:56.500,1:19:01.84,mean that's facetious of course but I

1:18:59.070,1:19:03.61,you know bill Stafford always you sit

1:19:01.840,1:19:05.47,can't write lower your standards and

1:19:03.610,1:19:07.27,that's actually tremendously good advice

1:19:05.470,1:19:10.45,to me because you lower your standards

1:19:07.270,1:19:11.92,and it can open up it can open up in so

1:19:10.450,1:19:13.66,many different ways you don't really

1:19:11.920,1:19:16.06,lower your standards you quit trying to

1:19:13.660,1:19:18.22,second-guess yourself you quit sitting

1:19:16.060,1:19:20.35,down trying to write a great poem

1:19:18.220,1:19:21.46,because there's that's a recipe for

1:19:20.350,1:19:28.45,disaster

1:19:21.460,1:19:31.57,yeah so it's sort of like the questions

1:19:28.450,1:19:33.19,is more specifically about computers and

1:19:31.570,1:19:34.90,some of its going to be repetitive so if

1:19:33.190,1:19:37.75,you've answered mostly you need to go

1:19:34.900,1:19:39.58,more because you do me the favor of

1:19:37.750,1:19:45.97,repeating ourselves if you don't mind

1:19:39.580,1:19:48.18,and so I think beginning system is you

1:19:45.970,1:19:52.81,began using computers on a regular basis

1:19:48.180,1:19:55.15,mid 90s mid 90s and that you started

1:19:52.810,1:19:57.34,using them basically just for like as

1:19:55.150,1:19:59.41,almost as the typewriter is and then how

1:19:57.340,1:20:01.69,did that how did that sort of change you

1:19:59.410,1:20:03.40,start where there's like things that it

1:20:01.690,1:20:06.55,became part of your life that you get

1:20:03.400,1:20:10.51,more with computers I really did not

1:20:06.550,1:20:11.98,start actively composing and composing

1:20:10.510,1:20:14.68,sometimes the bulk of the poem and

1:20:11.980,1:20:17.68,occasionally this has not happened to

1:20:14.680,1:20:22.63,very often that post poem I just point

1:20:17.680,1:20:24.46,out that prose poem in stanzas had to be

1:20:22.630,1:20:29.47,composed on the computer the whole of it

1:20:24.460,1:20:32.68,by which I mean I set the margins and I

1:20:29.470,1:20:34.54,still allowed the the word processing

1:20:32.680,1:20:38.65,program to determine where the ends of

1:20:34.540,1:20:41.95,the lines were but that also required

1:20:38.650,1:20:44.08,that I not sort of run the line on too

1:20:41.950,1:20:45.50,far before I began what I felt was in

1:20:44.080,1:20:47.23,other stanzas so I

1:20:45.500,1:20:49.16,my students accuse me of hitting pros

1:20:47.239,1:20:53.63,bumps I don't hate pros bones I just

1:20:49.160,1:20:55.43,don't see the point which is probably

1:20:53.630,1:20:56.75,ignorant of me there are prose poems I

1:20:55.430,1:20:58.69,love but yet I've never I've never

1:20:56.750,1:21:00.73,really been interested in writing one

1:20:58.699,1:21:04.13,until I sort of gave myself this

1:21:00.739,1:21:06.32,challenge what if I allowed the computer

1:21:04.130,1:21:08.21,to determine where the lines and but

1:21:06.320,1:21:10.19,still found a way to make its structure

1:21:08.210,1:21:11.44,appears though a reverse and not prose

1:21:10.190,1:21:14.75,yeah

1:21:11.449,1:21:18.73,and that's so that's what I that's what

1:21:14.750,1:21:21.08,I did I think however when I when I

1:21:18.739,1:21:22.61,first started trying to compose or do

1:21:21.080,1:21:24.50,the bulk of the composition on the

1:21:22.610,1:21:27.73,computer was after I was in this little

1:21:24.500,1:21:32.21,space which probably would have been

1:21:27.739,1:21:38.46,somewhere around 2000 late 2008 Ott's

1:21:32.210,1:21:40.69,about 2008 maybe and I started out just

1:21:38.469,1:21:46.10,on a kind of lark what happened if I

1:21:40.699,1:21:50.53,come out here and sit down and make a

1:21:46.100,1:21:53.81,poem in lines on the word processor and

1:21:50.530,1:21:57.89,the first I don't I think I was on

1:21:53.810,1:22:04.36,sabbatical and two as I am now

1:21:57.890,1:22:09.14,yeah I would have builded in 2007 and I

1:22:04.360,1:22:12.17,I didn't have much luck I didn't have

1:22:09.140,1:22:14.63,much luck making actual poems until all

1:22:12.170,1:22:17.36,of a sudden I did yeah

1:22:14.630,1:22:21.53,and that's when I decided to sort of

1:22:17.360,1:22:24.17,convert myself to part-time writing

1:22:21.530,1:22:27.44,longhand and part-time writing on the

1:22:24.170,1:22:31.07,computer and and that's and I've been

1:22:27.440,1:22:38.05,very comfortable with that ever since

1:22:31.070,1:22:41.69,so about 200,
1:22:38.050,1:22:44.17,that's when I really got started on it

1:22:41.699,1:22:47.82,and so you're sort of talking about this

1:22:44.170,1:22:50.17,today I guess are there any sort of

1:22:47.829,1:22:51.67,techniques or formats that you were able

1:22:50.170,1:22:54.34,to leave while you sort of said that's

1:22:51.670,1:22:55.44,it I guess it okay the more the more

1:22:54.340,1:22:58.03,sort of pressing business do you think

1:22:55.449,1:23:00.82,the you're using the computer has given

1:22:58.030,1:23:02.71,you advantages over previous of writing

1:23:00.820,1:23:06.03,and conversely has it what sort of

1:23:02.710,1:23:12.51,disadvantages you see it I don't see any

1:23:06.030,1:23:16.30,disadvantages really I have no sort of

1:23:12.510,1:23:18.57,worries about what it might do but at

1:23:16.300,1:23:21.57,this point I can't quite bring myself to

1:23:18.579,1:23:24.36,go back mainly because I'm having it

1:23:21.579,1:23:26.26,seems like I'm having good luck and part

1:23:24.369,1:23:28.86,of that may just be that I've gotten to

1:23:26.260,1:23:34.42,that point in my life or my career as a

1:23:28.860,1:23:37.15,writer I know a lot of tricks I know how

1:23:34.420,1:23:38.61,to trick myself I know how to uh I know

1:23:37.150,1:23:40.42,how to get going I know how to get out

1:23:38.619,1:23:42.34,of a lot of tight spaces I know how to

1:23:40.420,1:23:44.50,surprise myself for how to do those

1:23:42.340,1:23:47.61,things that might lead me to surprise

1:23:44.500,1:23:49.11,myself and I can do that on the computer

1:23:47.619,1:23:53.61,and I can do that with I can get

1:23:49.119,1:23:55.90,somewhere faster or so it seems

1:23:53.619,1:23:58.17,it might be an illusion but I don't

1:23:55.900,1:24:01.38,think that it is if there is a

1:23:58.179,1:24:04.38,disadvantage I don't have I don't have

1:24:01.389,1:24:14.36,well let me let me grab it let me grab

1:24:04.380,1:24:18.30,one of these no when this was 1996 I

1:24:14.369,1:24:20.65,mean but you I mean you can see I don't

1:24:18.309,1:24:23.17,do I mean look how neat that it's just

1:24:20.650,1:24:25.27,not a lot of there's not a lot of love

1:24:23.170,1:24:27.25,but you know there's then there's a

1:24:25.270,1:24:33.67,little bit more and crossing out and

1:24:27.250,1:24:37.30,stuffing what this is telling us yeah

1:24:33.670,1:24:38.86,there's a big big chunk cut and some of

1:24:37.300,1:24:43.21,us sometimes there's a little bit more

1:24:38.860,1:24:45.63,but and all those kinds of things but I

1:24:43.210,1:24:45.63,don't

1:24:45.659,1:24:50.36,the major revisions even here probably

1:24:47.969,1:24:55.83,began when I started converting to the

1:24:50.360,1:25:00.23,Knicks 9 when I started converting it to

1:24:55.830,1:25:04.46,type 2 a typewritten document yeah but I

1:25:00.239,1:25:08.07,missed this sometimes and I go back and

1:25:04.469,1:25:10.35,look and think I look how cool is this

1:25:08.070,1:25:12.27,is sort of an interesting thing to have

1:25:10.350,1:25:15.27,and I'm not producing this anymore

1:25:12.270,1:25:19.11,yeah and that yeah I worry about that I

1:25:15.270,1:25:23.61,mean I think I think and and no one

1:25:19.110,1:25:25.88,knows and you if you're if you're

1:25:23.610,1:25:29.21,writing in hopes that your poems will

1:25:25.889,1:25:31.94,last that makes you pretty normal but

1:25:29.219,1:25:35.06,there's no guarantee that and you know

1:25:31.949,1:25:37.02,you just feel no I mean everybody

1:25:35.060,1:25:38.69,everybody hopes that they might write

1:25:37.020,1:25:41.15,something that might last but you know

1:25:38.699,1:25:44.82,you don't always do the best you can and

1:25:41.159,1:25:47.52,but if there's a point at which one's

1:25:44.820,1:25:49.26,work draws the attention of some kind of

1:25:47.520,1:25:52.35,a scholar somebody who's willing to

1:25:49.260,1:25:53.88,study what you've done documents like

1:25:52.350,1:25:56.73,that are going to be really really

1:25:53.880,1:25:59.31,interesting because it was put on the

1:25:56.730,1:26:02.94,page by the hand of the poet rather than

1:25:59.310,1:26:05.28,just yeah ignited electronically no

1:26:02.940,1:26:10.17,there's so there's no thought being sort

1:26:05.280,1:26:11.76,of Express no and yeah well you get some

1:26:10.170,1:26:14.28,of some of these some of the margin me

1:26:11.760,1:26:17.10,and my own marginalia on my own poems

1:26:14.280,1:26:18.48,honey there's a big question mark but

1:26:17.100,1:26:23.25,then there's other times there's like

1:26:18.480,1:26:27.54,notes tools tools yeah uh I just saw a

1:26:23.250,1:26:29.31,couple of others egad I'll just pick it

1:26:27.540,1:26:32.76,up and I don't know what I wanted to

1:26:29.310,1:26:35.69,build on my glasses on but yeah making

1:26:32.760,1:26:38.04,notes to myself sometimes notes and

1:26:35.699,1:26:41.17,frustration yeah you know this is

1:26:38.040,1:26:41.17,idiotic right

1:26:43.690,1:26:50.44,says what I do it from classes Jesus oh

1:26:47.199,1:26:56.50,yeah Jesus just saw a truck get hit by

1:26:50.440,1:27:00.04,the train oh Jesus no I did Jesus Jesus

1:26:56.500,1:27:02.64,as in Jesus you have somebody and

1:27:00.040,1:27:06.37,understood subject oh yeah well yeah

1:27:02.640,1:27:08.71,well it's there's there's there's Lucy

1:27:06.370,1:27:10.33,do Lucifer duelin great yeah when it hit

1:27:08.710,1:27:18.55,his brother Jesus Christ who was born

1:27:10.330,1:27:20.44,dead so I get this is a sort of simple

1:27:18.550,1:27:23.41,maybe don't really simple but I the

1:27:20.440,1:27:26.92,internet play roles you like is that

1:27:23.410,1:27:30.64,connected yeah yeah I'm I when I built

1:27:26.920,1:27:34.66,the thing in 2002 I couldn't Ethernet

1:27:30.640,1:27:38.52,cable buried an Ethernet cable up so I

1:27:34.660,1:27:41.71,do I am wired out here yeah but I try to

1:27:38.520,1:27:43.36,not stay connected very awesome because

1:27:41.710,1:27:48.67,it's such an easy distraction on the

1:27:43.360,1:27:50.73,other hand we we came and I enjoyed

1:27:48.670,1:27:52.81,Scotland so much we I've been trying to

1:27:50.739,1:27:54.64,get her to apply to go to the castle at

1:27:52.810,1:27:57.46,Hawthorn and Rachelle has been there oh

1:27:54.640,1:27:59.19,yeah but then it turns out you can't get

1:27:57.460,1:28:01.30,on what you go don't want you to go as a

1:27:59.199,1:28:03.79,couple and there's no internet and kids

1:28:01.300,1:28:07.21,to forget it because she's a prose

1:28:03.790,1:28:10.78,writer and she said you know so much of

1:28:07.210,1:28:12.25,her the NSA must have a file five feet

1:28:10.780,1:28:14.71,thick on her because she written run a

1:28:12.250,1:28:16.54,novel about she downloaded maps of all

1:28:14.710,1:28:19.84,the oil fields and pipelines in the

1:28:16.540,1:28:22.93,Middle East I mean the course they're

1:28:19.840,1:28:25.27,watching her but all that came through

1:28:22.930,1:28:28.36,the internet so I mean it's it's a

1:28:25.270,1:28:29.83,useful thing and I still use it every

1:28:28.360,1:28:32.28,now and then and if I do wind up

1:28:29.830,1:28:36.00,submitting a poll I just sent a poem

1:28:32.280,1:28:42.94,well right before we left for the UK to

1:28:36.000,1:28:44.35,Paul Muldoon and and that you know it's

1:28:42.940,1:28:45.33,the only way to submit into New Yorkers

1:28:44.350,1:28:47.60,electronically

1:28:45.330,1:28:49.98,I'm not interested in in paper anymore

1:28:47.600,1:28:55.74,yeah I mean all the although you know

1:28:49.980,1:28:58.14,that's amazing you know that's good

1:28:55.740,1:29:00.96,somehow yeah it makes every week let you

1:28:58.140,1:29:05.19,use it for every one I think I think so

1:29:00.960,1:29:10.02,I think so it's I mean I did I don't I

1:29:05.190,1:29:14.22,don't worry about the book disappearing

1:29:10.020,1:29:16.14,and going to ebooks much and if it does

1:29:14.220,1:29:17.10,all these books of mine are going to be

1:29:16.140,1:29:22.65,worth a fortune

1:29:17.100,1:29:24.48,it's all that's the way I look at it so

1:29:22.650,1:29:26.67,I guess we sort of talked about this but

1:29:24.480,1:29:29.78,if you when do you consider a piece of

1:29:26.670,1:29:33.72,writing finished do you and had this

1:29:29.780,1:29:37.53,machine changer for opinion on that

1:29:33.720,1:29:39.45,regard I think that it that it's just

1:29:37.530,1:29:42.18,the same as a typewritten I don't

1:29:39.450,1:29:44.76,consider anything complete until I print

1:29:42.180,1:29:47.43,it off and then set it off into the

1:29:44.760,1:29:50.51,world but when I may when I did the when

1:29:47.430,1:29:54.36,I did the selected poems both here and

1:29:50.510,1:29:56.22,in the UK I made some changes not big

1:29:54.360,1:29:58.22,changes but I made some changes here and

1:29:56.220,1:30:03.33,there in poems so I don't consider the

1:29:58.220,1:30:06.09,sacred ever but mostly when I'm ready to

1:30:03.330,1:30:08.34,put it in a book it's it's it's finished

1:30:06.090,1:30:10.53,I'm just I'm not going to mess with it

1:30:08.340,1:30:14.87,anymore because I'm not you know I

1:30:10.530,1:30:18.27,really I just talked with Terence Hayes

1:30:14.870,1:30:20.40,whom I've known for a long time since he

1:30:18.270,1:30:24.60,was a he was never a wee boy he's nine

1:30:20.400,1:30:29.40,foot tall anyway but he didn't want to

1:30:24.600,1:30:32.13,read poems out of books at all bruh and

1:30:29.400,1:30:34.59,and we were both in England with Dennis

1:30:32.130,1:30:37.80,Newark C and katha pollitt they were the

1:30:34.590,1:30:39.24,four Americans there and I said I know

1:30:37.800,1:30:41.28,what you mean he's I said that I got

1:30:39.240,1:30:42.99,this brick look I've got to read from

1:30:41.280,1:30:44.76,the book every one of the publishers

1:30:42.990,1:30:47.70,here he wants to move copies in because

1:30:44.760,1:30:49.17,yeah you're right he doesn't have a

1:30:47.700,1:30:52.08,British publisher so they shipped

1:30:49.170,1:30:53.37,Penguin Books over there because I'd

1:30:52.080,1:30:54.38,want people to buy them otherwise they

1:30:53.370,1:30:58.46,got to ship them all

1:30:54.389,1:31:01.61,ACK so he had to read poems from from

1:30:58.469,1:31:03.36,the books and as he said to me and I

1:31:01.619,1:31:04.94,understand it's absolutely of readings

1:31:03.360,1:31:07.22,I'm not really interested in reading

1:31:04.949,1:31:09.47,those poems yeah it's like once that

1:31:07.229,1:31:12.30,books out there run along I'm interested

1:31:09.479,1:31:14.09,in in reading and sharing what I'm

1:31:12.300,1:31:18.89,working on is sort of testing it in

1:31:14.090,1:31:22.05,reading situations how do you feel about

1:31:18.899,1:31:23.63,the security and fixity of your files

1:31:22.050,1:31:26.11,when you have this but you have the

1:31:23.639,1:31:30.86,backup is that pretty much what worried

1:31:26.119,1:31:33.36,well yeah I did on this bookshelf here

1:31:30.869,1:31:37.11,there's a little piece of wood functions

1:31:33.360,1:31:44.09,as a book stop and I didn't used to have

1:31:37.110,1:31:47.13,that I had a big marble Oh book end at

1:31:44.099,1:31:48.80,which I was sitting like this at my feet

1:31:47.130,1:31:51.36,on the Hasek I was reading and I heard

1:31:48.809,1:31:56.01,something go slide and I just turned

1:31:51.360,1:32:00.30,just to see this 12 pound marble book

1:31:56.010,1:32:02.01,and just crush my laptop I managed to

1:32:00.300,1:32:03.44,pull the get the hard drive out and

1:32:02.010,1:32:05.23,retrieve everything hard drive was fine

1:32:03.449,1:32:11.63,it didn't hurt to just kill the the

1:32:05.239,1:32:13.32,mechanism yeah so I I'm not too worried

1:32:11.639,1:32:14.36,about it and then I also print things

1:32:13.320,1:32:16.05,off relentlessly

1:32:14.369,1:32:20.30,I mean I'd every time I get through a

1:32:16.050,1:32:24.51,draft and which is why I fill up so many

1:32:20.309,1:32:27.95,cartons of paper North Texas those

1:32:24.510,1:32:30.17,people who buy so many piles of writers

1:32:27.959,1:32:33.44,papers especially Western writers yeah

1:32:30.179,1:32:37.64,pay by the pound ha ha ha

1:32:33.449,1:32:38.93,so are you kidding me you should you're

1:32:37.649,1:32:40.86,going to pay me anything from my

1:32:38.939,1:32:47.36,electronic files now I'm printing this

1:32:40.860,1:32:49.19,off so it tapers heavy so I guess you

1:32:47.369,1:32:51.17,talked about having an external hard

1:32:49.199,1:32:53.92,drive before how did you what was that

1:32:51.179,1:32:56.18,process I can we more concerned about

1:32:53.929,1:32:59.36,crashes and whatnot in the earlier days

1:32:56.189,1:33:00.25,I think I was I'm less concerned with

1:32:59.369,1:33:03.57,the Mac

1:33:00.250,1:33:06.79,somehow it seems I mean I never have

1:33:03.570,1:33:08.71,never have any issues with it whereas PC

1:33:06.790,1:33:12.97,sometimes seemed kind of odd or they'd

1:33:08.710,1:33:15.61,be afflicted by some bug yeah and and

1:33:12.970,1:33:19.99,then so that worried me so I had this I

1:33:15.610,1:33:21.58,had this 3/4 terabyte hard drive that

1:33:19.990,1:33:24.16,every time I came out here I just plug

1:33:21.580,1:33:26.89,it in and it was on automatic backup and

1:33:24.160,1:33:31.03,it backed up all my photographs as well

1:33:26.890,1:33:32.44,as music and and mostly all my files and

1:33:31.030,1:33:34.36,while I while it was plugged in it would

1:33:32.440,1:33:37.90,back up every hour it would just back up

1:33:34.360,1:33:39.67,all my all my Word files and I've still

1:33:37.900,1:33:41.47,got that I'd have to plug it into it it

1:33:39.670,1:33:43.15,won't work it won't work on the Mac I'd

1:33:41.470,1:33:44.53,have to plug it into a PC somewhere

1:33:43.150,1:33:47.74,anymore it's out here somewhere

1:33:44.530,1:33:50.08,yeah and I every known and I think I

1:33:47.740,1:33:51.85,need to go by what an external drive for

1:33:50.080,1:33:55.12,the Mac to just so I can back things up

1:33:51.850,1:33:58.66,that way but then I don't yeah because I

1:33:55.120,1:34:00.49,do have a lot of paper right and and I

1:33:58.660,1:34:04.09,got stuff in the cloud and I got stuff

1:34:00.490,1:34:07.06,in mozi so I feel pretty sanguine about

1:34:04.090,1:34:08.73,the possibilities of it me being able to

1:34:07.060,1:34:11.08,retrieve something off a forest fire

1:34:08.730,1:34:14.32,rips through when I'm gone and it burns

1:34:11.080,1:34:18.04,up the computer and all my boxes of

1:34:14.320,1:34:22.02,poems and everything then it's mozi or

1:34:18.040,1:34:24.76,the cloud yeah and and that's it and

1:34:22.020,1:34:26.94,every place you know every place in the

1:34:24.760,1:34:31.18,woods in this part of Idaho burns right

1:34:26.940,1:34:33.37,it's not if it's when yeah and it hasn't

1:34:31.180,1:34:33.70,been here in a long time but could be

1:34:33.370,1:34:36.13,next

1:34:33.700,1:34:40.06,July or August or September or October

1:34:36.130,1:34:42.64,yeah I mean which concerns me yes yes

1:34:40.060,1:34:44.38,that does concern me and then despair I

1:34:42.640,1:34:47.47,especially like to move all that all

1:34:44.380,1:34:50.53,those boxes out of the closet get the

1:34:47.470,1:34:56.98,right offer positive well yeah I should

1:34:50.530,1:34:58.18,any vault yeah let me try guys just a

1:34:56.980,1:34:59.53,few more questions I want to talk a

1:34:58.180,1:35:02.80,little bit about correspondence in a

1:34:59.530,1:35:06.01,little bit about teaching but so do you

1:35:02.800,1:35:08.92,correspond much now with other writers

1:35:06.010,1:35:13.66,and I guess we'll talk about teaching

1:35:08.920,1:35:16.17,I do and I miss let's see I got that's a

1:35:13.660,1:35:19.05,letter from Philippine he wrote me

1:35:16.179,1:35:21.69,because I wrote him and I've got a file

1:35:19.050,1:35:23.73,in there probably an inch and a half

1:35:21.699,1:35:26.23,thick of letters from facility that's

1:35:23.739,1:35:27.85,almost all letters okay but I don't you

1:35:26.230,1:35:30.88,know I don't I probably write ten

1:35:27.850,1:35:34.42,letters twelve letters a year now and

1:35:30.880,1:35:36.48,I've got I've got a few people who are

1:35:34.420,1:35:38.59,really willing correspondence and write

1:35:36.489,1:35:41.38,back they still like the idea of letters

1:35:38.590,1:35:42.52,yeah and and I do too I love getting the

1:35:41.380,1:35:45.61,letter it's not like getting an email

1:35:42.520,1:35:50.05,yeah but but most of the correspondences

1:35:45.610,1:35:54.94,via email anymore and I try to print

1:35:50.050,1:35:56.77,those off I've got it I think I've got

1:35:54.940,1:35:59.05,two or three letters from Billy Collins

1:35:56.770,1:36:01.75,I've known Billy for a long time too but

1:35:59.050,1:36:04.54,our correspondence over the last decade

1:36:01.750,1:36:06.16,has been entirely electronic all these

1:36:04.540,1:36:08.94,abbreviated little snippets which are

1:36:06.160,1:36:10.84,hilarious because he's very funny

1:36:08.949,1:36:13.75,tremendously witty and he's especially

1:36:10.840,1:36:15.67,good in letters too as well as in poems

1:36:13.750,1:36:16.69,and and so we have a great deal of fun

1:36:15.670,1:36:18.96,but there are these little short

1:36:16.690,1:36:21.73,snippets which I find myself compelled

1:36:18.969,1:36:24.10,to come out and print off of the whole

1:36:21.730,1:36:27.28,the whole thread of the thing one email

1:36:24.100,1:36:29.59,at a time that's on a page that love but

1:36:27.280,1:36:32.67,I want to I want to say to those things

1:36:29.590,1:36:35.38,right and something about saving and

1:36:32.670,1:36:37.75,electronically doesn't seem like saving

1:36:35.380,1:36:41.11,them on paper yeah

1:36:37.750,1:36:44.56,when did email start to become their

1:36:41.110,1:36:48.73,primary motive probably around the turn

1:36:44.560,1:36:50.29,of the millennium I think for me and it

1:36:48.730,1:36:51.96,what you know is so exciting is cristy

1:36:50.290,1:36:55.90,idea of being able to communicate

1:36:51.960,1:36:58.54,communicate so quickly yeah but then you

1:36:55.900,1:37:00.25,you realize you realize what's missing I

1:36:58.540,1:37:01.90,mean I can go back and look at like I

1:37:00.250,1:37:02.60,let her some Gwendolyn Brooks I did

1:37:01.900,1:37:05.30,letters

1:37:02.600,1:37:08.75,sticky wicket Hugo like that this

1:37:05.300,1:37:11.08,wonderful file of letters which is a

1:37:08.750,1:37:15.89,forest fire burns through there gone to

1:37:11.080,1:37:17.57,thinking anyway free living but I do the

1:37:15.890,1:37:19.64,communications a lot of the

1:37:17.570,1:37:23.03,communications you know I've got just

1:37:19.640,1:37:26.60,I've got a file on one of my two email

1:37:23.030,1:37:28.31,addresses I get a lot of writerly emails

1:37:26.600,1:37:30.98,on the U of I account because that's the

1:37:28.310,1:37:32.90,easiest one to find I've got a gmail

1:37:30.980,1:37:36.08,account that I just kind of keep private

1:37:32.900,1:37:40.94,that's my business file and my personal

1:37:36.080,1:37:43.82,file or my personal real email so I save

1:37:40.940,1:37:46.76,all those all those communications from

1:37:43.820,1:37:48.89,other poets other writers but I don't

1:37:46.760,1:37:50.87,print all of them all some i some I do

1:37:48.890,1:37:52.07,some seem important enough to print off

1:37:50.870,1:37:55.01,other stone okay

1:37:52.070,1:37:59.87,and that sort of that's your like online

1:37:55.010,1:38:03.34,something that you got ahold here yeah I

1:37:59.870,1:38:08.63,forget a particularly great letter

1:38:03.340,1:38:10.34,published a poem in The New Yorker lot

1:38:08.630,1:38:12.41,Singh that issue up there the Obama

1:38:10.340,1:38:15.74,issue with oh wow you had a Lincoln

1:38:12.410,1:38:17.63,Memorial and I've never had a response

1:38:15.740,1:38:21.35,to a poem like that it's the poem called

1:38:17.630,1:38:28.61,it's in beautiful country shit what does

1:38:21.350,1:38:32.84,it call Exxon and I got a hundred and

1:38:28.610,1:38:34.70,forty some odd emails from a lot of

1:38:32.840,1:38:36.26,people I know a lot of poets I know of

1:38:34.700,1:38:40.79,but don't really know and a lot of

1:38:36.260,1:38:43.46,strangers vets amputees just you know

1:38:40.790,1:38:45.23,all of them positive nobody know they're

1:38:43.460,1:38:47.06,nothing and all of that stuff you know I

1:38:45.230,1:38:49.01,printed off I got a whole file just of

1:38:47.060,1:38:51.17,those kinds of things to just to have

1:38:49.010,1:38:54.86,that kind of response to a poll you got

1:38:51.170,1:38:56.45,to save that in some in hardcopy I guess

1:38:54.860,1:38:59.36,is what I'm saying I couldn't just leave

1:38:56.450,1:39:01.60,those sort of loose on the net and in

1:38:59.360,1:39:01.60,the

1:39:01.700,1:39:06.57,Yeah right I mean they're probably no

1:39:04.950,1:39:07.98,more permanent now given that I live in

1:39:06.570,1:39:11.28,the place that's likely to break for

1:39:07.980,1:39:13.80,inspire but they seem that way to me now

1:39:11.280,1:39:15.39,and it's easy enough to look at them

1:39:13.800,1:39:17.04,just like if I should want to which I

1:39:15.390,1:39:19.02,have not but did you have any

1:39:17.040,1:39:21.48,experiences like that I mean I I'm

1:39:19.020,1:39:22.95,assuming so New Yorker with all that

1:39:21.480,1:39:24.36,exposure but did you have like letters

1:39:22.950,1:39:28.74,come to you when you were younger and

1:39:24.360,1:39:31.44,there was not email oh yeah oh yeah I

1:39:28.740,1:39:33.15,mean I've always got I've got a couple

1:39:36.630,1:39:40.32,you don't know

1:39:37.170,1:39:41.82,yeah but also sometimes I think that's

1:39:40.320,1:39:44.46,the difference between two files as one

1:39:41.820,1:39:47.46,as people I know who send me terrific

1:39:44.460,1:39:49.02,poem and such and such or then poems

1:39:49.020,1:39:57.23,pile called crank I've gotten like four

1:39:52.590,1:39:59.30,or five anonymous letters from some

1:40:42.240,1:40:46.89,kind of the way I warmed up okay when I

1:40:44.610,1:40:49.20,would get into my writing space here or

1:40:46.890,1:40:51.93,inland or I had another check very

1:40:49.200,1:40:54.23,similar to this and that was how I

1:40:51.930,1:40:57.66,warmed up I'd write a letter to somebody

1:40:54.230,1:40:59.16,something sometimes with my mom but most

1:40:57.660,1:41:01.77,often it was just another poet another

1:40:59.160,1:41:03.72,poet friend I'd write him a letter

1:41:01.770,1:41:07.44,about palms I resent him a couple of

1:41:03.720,1:41:10.38,poems and when email came along that

1:41:07.440,1:41:14.10,sort of there's something about a tat of

1:41:10.380,1:41:17.55,putting a poem as an attachment and send

1:41:14.100,1:41:19.89,us somebody that seems like more like a

1:41:17.550,1:41:23.52,violation if you put it folded in an

1:41:19.890,1:41:25.71,envelope with a letter it's it's much

1:41:23.520,1:41:28.89,more friendly or intimate kind of

1:41:25.710,1:41:30.18,gesture than the email is yeah I kind of

1:41:28.890,1:41:31.80,understand what you're saying but I also

1:41:30.180,1:41:33.18,it's surprising because in some ways

1:41:31.800,1:41:35.49,that should make it that much more

1:41:33.180,1:41:37.77,easily available to you to write your

1:41:35.490,1:41:42.09,friends and sent home well yeah and as

1:41:37.770,1:41:44.22,of course it does I mean when I in the

1:41:42.090,1:41:45.51,last few times I have sent poems off to

1:41:44.220,1:41:48.36,other people I think I said something

1:41:45.510,1:41:51.06,David Baker a few years ago just to you

1:41:48.360,1:41:54.27,know get some feedback on and and I said

1:41:51.060,1:41:56.19,those email last time I sent poems to

1:41:54.270,1:41:59.13,anybody else to look at who was not Kim

1:41:56.190,1:42:00.90,I think I said the me mail so it every

1:41:59.130,1:42:04.38,day it's very easy to do that it's a

1:42:00.900,1:42:07.26,convenient but it's not as it isn't as

1:42:04.380,1:42:08.88,intimate and that and I suppose or it

1:42:07.260,1:42:12.69,doesn't seem this into why is it any

1:42:08.880,1:42:17.10,less intimate right great I don't have a

1:42:12.690,1:42:18.54,shade on a swindle or a value I didn't I

1:42:17.100,1:42:19.71,didn't actually ask you one question I

1:42:18.540,1:42:22.14,believe you're sitting you're sort of

1:42:19.710,1:42:24.39,routine do you come out here in the

1:42:22.140,1:42:27.21,mornings and I mean is there like set

1:42:24.390,1:42:30.15,times or is it whenever well it's mostly

1:42:27.210,1:42:32.13,whenever I can I've got I mean I have

1:42:30.150,1:42:33.69,long days I teach Tuesdays and Thursdays

1:42:32.130,1:42:35.19,when I took this job that was my

1:42:33.690,1:42:36.63,understanding my teaching schedule will

1:42:35.190,1:42:39.30,be Tuesday and Thursday so I teach

1:42:36.630,1:42:41.22,Tuesdays and Thursdays I'm usually in by

1:42:39.300,1:42:43.71,9:00 I almost always have a night class

1:42:41.220,1:42:46.50,so i'm i don't leave tilt so i put in

1:42:43.710,1:42:49.26,like 12 13 hours on campus Tuesday and

1:42:46.500,1:42:51.39,Thursday Wednesday tends to be my campus

1:42:49.260,1:42:54.42,day when I'm gone just doing regular

1:42:51.390,1:42:56.01,office hours and hopefully if I'm on a

1:42:54.420,1:42:57.51,committee I can get them to schedule

1:42:56.010,1:42:59.10,meetings on Wednesday if they don't want

1:42:57.510,1:43:02.40,to do Wednesday I'll do Friday but I'd

1:42:59.100,1:43:06.66,rather have theoretically Monday and

1:43:02.400,1:43:11.34,Friday that's when I write and so I get

1:43:06.660,1:43:14.07,out here by between my

1:43:11.349,1:43:19.68,ten it varies depends on what else is

1:43:14.079,1:43:20.97,going on to the year and you know it's

1:43:19.689,1:43:23.28,cold weather I build a fire get it

1:43:20.979,1:43:26.40,warmed up to maybe do a little email

1:43:23.289,1:43:28.05,work to catch up and then and then get

1:43:26.409,1:43:30.12,started and go in for lunch about

1:43:28.059,1:43:32.69,noonish 12:30 between 12:30 and 1:0,
1:43:30.129,1:43:36.07,come back up and stay till about 5:0,
1:43:32.699,1:43:37.71,and that's that and that that's pretty

1:43:36.070,1:43:42.48,much been my routine really for a long

1:43:37.719,1:43:44.28,time now for 20 years yeah and you know

1:43:42.489,1:43:47.70,it's it's a pretty it's a pretty good

1:43:44.280,1:43:50.76,way to work I mean right it's it's a

1:43:47.709,1:43:54.15,luxury to have time it's an even greater

1:43:50.769,1:43:55.98,luxury to be on sabbatical or as I

1:43:54.159,1:44:00.28,envisioned it when I retire permanent

1:43:55.989,1:44:04.74,sabbatical yeah we'll see about that

1:44:00.280,1:44:07.71,see how that works so I guess the last

1:44:04.749,1:44:10.59,sort of questions late you know with

1:44:07.719,1:44:11.85,teaching and the sort of advent of the

1:44:10.599,1:44:13.38,computer coming through your teaching

1:44:11.859,1:44:16.14,how does that sort of change your

1:44:13.389,1:44:17.55,day-to-day life I mean there's much more

1:44:16.149,1:44:22.23,access to you but there's also surgery

1:44:17.559,1:44:23.76,on barriers I don't know well it on the

1:44:22.239,1:44:26.55,negative side you know you're here

1:44:23.769,1:44:29.46,you're available you're sort of at the

1:44:26.559,1:44:31.32,end of this electronic tether so you

1:44:29.469,1:44:34.23,can't get away from the students that

1:44:31.329,1:44:40.09,way but you know my students tend to be

1:44:34.239,1:44:41.28,pretty aware of what I'm up to and but

1:44:40.090,1:44:43.55,there are certain things they just got

1:44:41.289,1:44:45.96,to know about and sometimes beyond they

1:44:43.559,1:44:47.70,can you know can we meet tomorrow I know

1:44:45.969,1:44:49.71,you're coming I get office hours I don't

1:44:47.709,1:44:51.87,if you got any time between 2:00 and

1:44:49.719,1:44:53.59,3:00 if I can stop by could we look at

1:44:51.879,1:44:55.03,these two poems in there so there's an

1:44:53.590,1:44:57.69,attachment with a couple of poems and

1:44:55.030,1:44:59.70,that that's that's both the downside

1:44:57.699,1:45:00.84,that they can they only have to call you

1:44:59.709,1:45:02.64,they don't have to make an appointment

1:45:00.849,1:45:06.21,or come by they can just ask you and

1:45:02.649,1:45:08.82,there you are at home and and you

1:45:06.219,1:45:10.84,respond and I do it's also great though

1:45:08.829,1:45:12.24,because they can do that and it's a

1:45:10.840,1:45:13.53,whole lot more convenient and I'm sure I

1:45:12.249,1:45:14.67,got the poems now I can read them

1:45:13.539,1:45:17.67,tonight I'll talk to you about them

1:45:14.679,1:45:19.86,tomorrow coming to 2:30 so it's it's

1:45:17.679,1:45:23.56,both mostly I think it's positive mostly

1:45:19.869,1:45:25.87,I think it's good I'm on sabbatical

1:45:23.560,1:45:28.96,Kim's not on sabbatical she worked out

1:45:25.870,1:45:32.53,being gone for 13 days while we went to

1:45:28.960,1:45:35.05,the UK all she did when we were in all

1:45:32.530,1:45:36.85,bruh all she did was correspondence with

1:45:35.050,1:45:38.62,her students I mean she was doing it

1:45:36.850,1:45:42.13,like well we were there for four days

1:45:38.620,1:45:43.33,she did that nothing but and she never

1:45:42.130,1:45:45.79,didn't get to see much of all bruh

1:45:43.330,1:45:47.44,because of that but and then everybody

1:45:45.790,1:45:50.35,else at the festival thought my wife was

1:45:47.440,1:45:54.16,a myth and a shame only came out once

1:45:50.350,1:45:56.08,but do you think do you see like this

1:45:54.160,1:45:57.91,sort of I mean you call much a little

1:45:56.080,1:45:59.83,bit more computer is absolutely those

1:45:57.910,1:46:02.11,those who can raise digital natives or

1:45:59.830,1:46:03.91,whatever has they sort of changed your

1:46:02.110,1:46:07.53,relationship to computers that they sort

1:46:03.910,1:46:07.53,of any sort of like their sort of

1:46:07.710,1:46:13.66,comfort and use of it has that sort of

1:46:11.350,1:46:16.05,done anything to your own teaching or

1:46:13.660,1:46:22.66,your own for writing in that way

1:46:16.050,1:46:24.10,teaching maybe insofar as what I love

1:46:22.660,1:46:26.14,especially in graduate classes

1:46:24.100,1:46:27.70,especially in things like that are the

1:46:26.140,1:46:31.93,techniques class of tried teaching in

1:46:27.700,1:46:33.61,the spring in which we'll be we'll be

1:46:31.930,1:46:36.66,talking about in volume a different

1:46:33.610,1:46:40.99,volume of contemporary poetry every week

1:46:36.660,1:46:43.66,and we'll have a you know a good two and

1:46:40.990,1:46:45.52,a half three hour discussion about this

1:46:43.660,1:46:47.02,book of poems how the book works on the

1:46:45.520,1:46:49.99,individual poems work how this

1:46:47.020,1:46:51.91,particular poet does his or her work and

1:46:49.990,1:46:52.96,it'll be great they'll be in figuring

1:46:51.910,1:46:55.03,and I'll come home and I immediately

1:46:52.960,1:46:57.40,think of like 37 different things I

1:46:55.030,1:46:59.98,should have said or ways to connect

1:46:57.400,1:47:01.96,things that they said and sort of bind

1:46:59.980,1:47:04.72,our conversation together and the email

1:47:01.960,1:47:06.79,let's do a class emails and just with

1:47:04.720,1:47:09.46,bullets and say here's this anise anise

1:47:06.790,1:47:11.11,anise I can add two or three links the

1:47:09.460,1:47:13.14,things they need to consider I never

1:47:11.110,1:47:17.53,that was one of the great things about

1:47:13.140,1:47:19.39,about the internet I thought I hear what

1:47:17.530,1:47:25.30,the what the class was called it was an

1:47:19.390,1:47:26.32,American Lit class English 570 so

1:47:25.300,1:47:27.52,studies in American and English

1:47:26.320,1:47:30.04,literature I think it was but anyway

1:47:27.520,1:47:33.51,20th century and I taught Hart Crane

1:47:30.040,1:47:35.55,taught the bridge and you know they both

1:47:33.510,1:47:38.85,despised toward cram

1:47:35.550,1:47:42.87,it's not easy and it's a failed epic god

1:47:38.850,1:47:44.55,bless him but we haven't we had a

1:47:42.870,1:47:48.12,wonderful discussion about what

1:47:44.550,1:47:51.36,qualifies is failure and ambition and so

1:47:48.120,1:47:53.22,forth and I was able to send them the

1:47:51.360,1:47:55.83,follow-up email that tried to bind the

1:47:53.220,1:47:58.44,class discussion together with all sorts

1:47:55.830,1:48:01.89,of references and links to other things

1:47:58.440,1:48:03.69,they could read about Krane yeah which I

1:48:01.890,1:48:10.50,think was a great pen so it's a it's a

1:48:03.690,1:48:14.46,great pedagogical tool that way um hey

1:48:10.500,1:48:19.07,guys I think I've exhausted it Oh unless

1:48:14.460,1:48:21.93,you have any other I mean I guess no

1:48:19.070,1:48:23.64,well I think they cover pretty much

1:48:21.930,1:48:25.05,everything you want to cover okay we

1:48:23.640,1:48:27.66,have a good sense of your writing

1:48:25.050,1:48:29.82,process there anything as you do I mean

1:48:27.660,1:48:32.43,you're you're writing letters in the

1:48:29.820,1:48:34.23,earlier part of your career to get

1:48:32.430,1:48:36.66,warmed up before an interesting read and

1:48:34.230,1:48:39.69,what do you do anything too busy to get

1:48:36.660,1:48:42.51,warmed up now read actually I write

1:48:39.690,1:48:45.00,sonnets right on yeah I mean I've done

1:48:42.510,1:48:49.74,I've got I probably have a hundred

1:48:45.000,1:48:57.12,sonnets I think I've published two in

1:48:49.740,1:49:00.42,books but I love the form and the form

1:48:57.120,1:49:04.35,is very friendly to me and they're

1:49:00.420,1:49:08.78,mostly sort of hybridized I like I like

1:49:04.350,1:49:08.78,the Italian octave I like a BBA a BBA

1:49:08.810,1:49:13.17,and then a kind of Shakespearean couplet

1:49:11.490,1:49:17.10,at the end or at least a kind of cup

1:49:13.170,1:49:19.89,loaded rhyme at the end and I like and

1:49:17.100,1:49:22.20,I'll sit down I'll spend the first two

1:49:19.890,1:49:26.16,hours just just kind of messing around

1:49:22.200,1:49:27.66,with a sonnet yeah and I don't really

1:49:26.160,1:49:29.58,need it's like with the sonnet I don't

1:49:27.660,1:49:32.55,really need any I don't need an idea I

1:49:29.580,1:49:34.20,just start putting words on paper it'll

1:49:32.550,1:49:37.10,have to do with the frost it'll have to

1:49:34.200,1:49:39.89,do it still

1:49:37.109,1:49:43.85,I think it fell down was an enormous

1:49:39.899,1:49:48.32,active I think it's gone anyway I can't

1:49:43.859,1:49:50.82,see the paper bald feels boldface

1:49:48.329,1:49:53.24,hornet's nest about the so around up in

1:49:50.820,1:49:56.09,the tree I think I got three or four

1:49:53.249,1:49:58.55,what I call wind spread sonnets out of

1:49:56.099,1:50:00.74,that thing just looking up and watching

1:49:58.559,1:50:02.28,them or Mnet's go in and out yeah which

1:50:00.749,1:50:03.95,I at some point this winter I need to

1:50:02.280,1:50:05.51,take the shotgun out and blast out of

1:50:03.959,1:50:08.48,the tree other way because next year

1:50:05.519,1:50:11.63,it'll be this big so I can't I don't

1:50:08.489,1:50:13.34,want that no yeah where did you write

1:50:11.639,1:50:16.01,this down on in a notebook right

1:50:13.349,1:50:17.55,oh no I just sat down the computer and

1:50:16.019,1:50:21.71,started writing down does it like you

1:50:17.550,1:50:23.96,yeah because I and and and it loosens me

1:50:21.719,1:50:26.03,up gets things going and sometimes I'll

1:50:23.969,1:50:27.44,get halfway into it or I'll get 13 lines

1:50:26.039,1:50:29.76,into one and I'll feel sort of

1:50:27.449,1:50:33.08,desperation and on this yeah

1:50:29.760,1:50:34.80,finish it off somehow it rhymes and it's

1:50:33.089,1:50:37.99,not a success home like I said I've only

1:50:34.800,1:50:40.67,used if I've got a hundred I've use to

1:50:37.999,1:50:42.89,but it gets day it gets the it gets the

1:50:40.679,1:50:45.53,wheels turning and then I can turn here

1:50:42.899,1:50:49.58,and I can start writing down lines and
