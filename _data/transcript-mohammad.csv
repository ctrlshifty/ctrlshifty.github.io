,,
0:00m31.949,0:00m36.66,in central hall okay so the first the
,,
0:00m35.219,0:00m39.12,first section is kind of a short answer
,,
0:00m36.660,0:00m43.02,it's meant to get a sense of your
,,
0:00m39.120,0:00m44.12,digital practices now and do you just
,,
0:00m43.020,0:00m44.96,kind of just kind of go through this and
,,
0:00m44.129,0:00m47.52,then we'll talk more about the
,,
0:00m44.969,0:00m51.14,composition okay so what joggers do you
,,
0:00m47.520,0:00m53.69,work in poetry okay and that's your
,,
0:00m51.149,0:00m55.85,primary genre yeah what kinds of devices
,,
0:00m53.699,0:01m00.00,do you own or have access to for writing
,,
0:00m55.850,0:01m02.34,this laptop MacBooks okay that's made of
,,
0:01m00.000,0:01m06.09,about it now the other things whatever
,,
0:01m02.340,0:01m08.34,scratch pad I might note an idea so do
,,
0:01m06.090,0:01m10.04,you see so you used only that one you
,,
0:01m08.340,0:01m12.45,write on a phone you write on any other
,,
0:01m10.049,0:01m14.10,things usually not I mean the laptop is
,,
0:01m12.450,0:01m19.20,the maintenance Oh threat back up to the
,,
0:01m14.100,0:01m22.59,management and you have an apple so and
,,
0:01m19.200,0:01m24.00,also I mean do you then when you said
,,
0:01m22.590,0:01m25.89,you use some note that you know paper
,,
0:01m24.000,0:01m27.63,sometimes I mean if I'm somewhere in all
,,
0:01m25.890,0:01m29.13,I have as a piece of scratch paper
,,
0:01m27.630,0:01m31.40,because I'm in a meeting and I get an
,,
0:01m29.130,0:01m34.50,idea and I want to lose it but that's I
,,
0:01m31.409,0:01m36.43,don't really do that that often okay so
,,
0:01m34.500,0:01m39.81,it's pretty primarily on that computer
,,
0:01m36.439,0:01m42.32,that it's mostly it okay do you have any
,,
0:01m39.810,0:01m45.03,I mean you for your writing this is
,,
0:01m42.329,0:01m46.71,where we get to do you ever have take
,,
0:01m45.030,0:01m49.02,like pre writing your notes for it I
,,
0:01m46.710,0:01m52.43,mean because of the kind of writing I do
,,
0:01m49.020,0:01m54.29,that usually doesn't come into play yeah
,,
0:01m52.439,0:01m57.45,I think will become clear when we talk
,,
0:01m54.299,0:01m58.77,about the actual composition okay and
,,
0:01m57.450,0:02m03.42,then what format do you save your
,,
0:01m58.770,0:02m05.13,digital files work we're done do you say
,,
0:02m03.420,0:02m06.36,the individual works as you go along or
,,
0:02m05.130,0:02m06.96,do you simply save over what you've
,,
0:02m06.360,0:02m08.78,written
,,
0:02m06.960,0:02m12.36,do you have like do you save like draft
,,
0:02m08.789,0:02m12.93,I don't know I don't I almost never
,,
0:02m12.360,0:02m15.12,saved
,,
0:02m12.930,0:02m17.22,it's okay so just open up a doc and
,,
0:02m15.120,0:02m19.89,write over it until I think it's
,,
0:02m17.220,0:02m23.22,finished okay and what are your naming
,,
0:02m19.890,0:02m25.23,conventions for your files usually the
,,
0:02m23.220,0:02m27.84,name of the poem followed by the file
,,
0:02m25.230,0:02m29.40,names and so yeah but in so because you
,,
0:02m27.840,0:02m31.68,don't use drafts you're just like it's
,,
0:02m29.400,0:02m33.54,just what I don't rename it once I've
,,
0:02m31.680,0:02m34.40,drafted it or anything yes because it
,,
0:02m33.540,0:02m36.45,just stays the same
,,
0:02m34.409,0:02m38.18,do you ever do you print out your
,,
0:02m36.450,0:02m42.09,writing to revise it
,,
0:02m38.180,0:02m46.07,no not typically okay no not what
,,
0:02m42.090,0:02m47.64,exactly I might do that on occasion with
,,
0:02m46.079,0:02m49.92,over the essay or something with an
,,
0:02m47.640,0:02m51.95,essay because yes I need to be able to
,,
0:02m49.920,0:02m54.26,easy on the eyes but the poems are
,,
0:02m51.959,0:02m56.09,usually shorter and again because of the
,,
0:02m54.269,0:02m57.87,specific nature of the composition sure
,,
0:02m56.099,0:03m01.26,as in some cases it will see it's like
,,
0:02m57.870,0:03m04.37,they can't really revise it very well at
,,
0:03m01.260,0:03m07.34,all if it's not on the computer yeah
,,
0:03m04.379,0:03m10.34,and so if you don't use ever save any
,,
0:03m07.349,0:03m12.23,paper copies of interim grass usually
,,
0:03m10.349,0:03m13.53,not okay I mean I think the only
,,
0:03m12.239,0:03m14.90,exception is that is maybe I have some
,,
0:03m13.530,0:03m16.91,paper copies somewhere or something I
,,
0:03m14.909,0:03m19.10,wrote college open no one ever sees it
,,
0:03m16.910,0:03m22.65,the way they were written I don't never
,,
0:03m19.109,0:03m25.20,bought the transcribers Angele so deep
,,
0:03m22.650,0:03m27.76,do you back up your work yeah when I
,,
0:03m25.200,0:03m30.03,remember yeah I mean how often do you do
,,
0:03m27.769,0:03m32.51,instances of streaming I don't know I
,,
0:03m30.030,0:03m36.98,probably need to do it right now
,,
0:03m32.510,0:03m39.38,i I really is very erratic okay
,,
0:03m36.989,0:03m41.40,and so as you do you don't use like a
,,
0:03m39.389,0:03m43.44,cloud-based you'd like a Dropbox or
,,
0:03m41.400,0:03m45.75,anything I mean is that you know I've
,,
0:03m43.440,0:03m47.60,got a server here on campus there's a
,,
0:03m45.750,0:03m49.07,backup server listening to it which is
,,
0:03m47.609,0:03m51.00,very simple all I need to do is drag
,,
0:03m49.079,0:03m55.50,stuff right now I could do it stop
,,
0:03m51.000,0:03m57.15,worrying about it place yeah if I was
,,
0:03m55.500,0:03m58.29,like an external hard drive at home you
,,
0:03m57.150,0:03m59.79,have an external in that if you're going
,,
0:03m58.290,0:04m01.04,to archive it if you're going to back it
,,
0:03m59.790,0:04m04.59,up that's where you put the with the
,,
0:04m01.049,0:04m06.87,word okay and say like if you have like
,,
0:04m04.590,0:04m08.54,a separate thing for once what once a
,,
0:04m06.870,0:04m10.91,poem is finished do you move it to a
,,
0:04m08.549,0:04m12.90,different folder or there any yeah I
,,
0:04m10.919,0:04m18.51,work I've gotten kind of wax on I need
,,
0:04m12.900,0:04m20.63,to go in and and uh you know update it
,,
0:04m18.510,0:04m26.43,but you typically will be is I'll have a
,,
0:04m20.639,0:04m27.84,folder tree folder and within that
,,
0:04m26.430,0:04m29.40,there are specific categories for
,,
0:04m27.840,0:04m32.00,certain projects so I'll divide them
,,
0:04m29.400,0:04m34.59,into that like a book project yeah or or
,,
0:04m32.009,0:04m36.33,whatever and if something is published
,,
0:04m34.590,0:04m39.00,typically I'll put a copy of it in the
,,
0:04m36.330,0:04m40.77,published folder and then another will
,,
0:04m39.000,0:04m46.25,be like an ongoing or in process
,,
0:04m40.770,0:04m49.41,whatever do you keep pre copies of final
,,
0:04m46.259,0:04m50.69,drafts you print them out not usually
,,
0:04m49.410,0:04m52.56,and how about the media you've been
,,
0:04m50.699,0:04m54.27,published in do you keep the journals I
,,
0:04m52.560,0:04m57.93,do sorry I was gonna show up full of
,,
0:04m54.270,0:05m00.18,journals and books and so do you have
,,
0:04m57.930,0:05m05.75,any standard practices for archiving or
,,
0:05m00.180,0:05m05.75,digitally or for physically what you say
,,
0:05m06.889,0:05m10.91,I guess I mean do you have like like
,,
0:05m09.389,0:05m12.33,when you put it on it but like do you
,,
0:05m10.919,0:05m13.83,have like a certain kind of way you go
,,
0:05m12.330,0:05m15.57,and put it on an external hard drive or
,,
0:05m13.830,0:05m17.28,you put all the book all your papers or
,,
0:05m15.570,0:05m19.28,books in a certain shelf and that's kind
,,
0:05m17.280,0:05m21.38,of like your archive yeah all right yes
,,
0:05m19.289,0:05m23.22,like I say I do have a shelf in my liver
,,
0:05m21.389,0:05m24.78,yeah it's like most of the journals and
,,
0:05m23.220,0:05m28.56,books and mythology's that have
,,
0:05m24.780,0:05m30.12,published in yeah and as far as I said
,,
0:05m28.560,0:05m32.97,for the digital files were together
,,
0:05m30.120,0:05m36.99,usually a published folder okay which is
,,
0:05m32.970,0:05m38.55,way behind being updated but yes and so
,,
0:05m36.990,0:05m40.71,have you ever received your sought out
,,
0:05m38.550,0:05m42.47,information about digital archiving or
,,
0:05m40.710,0:05m44.69,any sort of practices in that way not
,,
0:05m42.479,0:05m46.62,really another that would you be
,,
0:05m44.699,0:05m50.69,interested in receiving information I'm
,,
0:05m46.620,0:05m54.87,possibly no okay that was the kind of
,,
0:05m50.699,0:05m57.27,spaces and so this gets more to the to
,,
0:05m54.870,0:06m00.06,the kind of like your your trajectory as
,,
0:05m57.270,0:06m02.76,a writer and so it's startup kind of
,,
0:06m00.060,0:06m05.27,getting a larger arc of it so how long
,,
0:06m02.760,0:06m07.19,have you been writing in estill we're in
,,
0:06m05.270,0:06m10.83,current there and in quotations here
,,
0:06m07.199,0:06m13.34,professionally I'd say since roughly in
,,
0:06m10.830,0:06m16.62,98 or 99 and you and could you kind of
,,
0:06m13.349,0:06m20.69,give us a sense of like the arc of your
,,
0:06m16.620,0:06m21.59,career over that time period sure I mean
,,
0:06m20.699,0:06m24.22,I said that was when I was just
,,
0:06m21.599,0:06m26.37,finishing grad school and
,,
0:06m24.229,0:06m28.80,procrastinating on finishing my
,,
0:06m26.370,0:06m31.02,dissertation so I kind of went back to
,,
0:06m28.800,0:06m33.47,my longtime interest in contemporary
,,
0:06m31.020,0:06m34.46,poetry and I think I had tried to send a
,,
0:06m33.479,0:06m36.65,few things out to get them published
,,
0:06m34.469,0:06m38.34,over the years a few times without any
,,
0:06m36.659,0:06m42.21,success and yeah or sense of direction
,,
0:06m38.340,0:06m45.65,about it and then during all this time
,,
0:06m42.210,0:06m48.63,wasting period you know I became aware
,,
0:06m45.659,0:06m50.27,of electronic you know journals that
,,
0:06m48.630,0:06m53.33,were publishing authors I liked and
,,
0:06m50.279,0:06m56.25,before that I hadn't known even how to
,,
0:06m53.330,0:06m57.57,submit work yet to the same journals
,,
0:06m56.250,0:06m59.88,that would publish the kind of writers I
,,
0:06m57.570,0:07m03.12,liked because you know I had tried
,,
0:06m59.880,0:07m05.52,mister for example 5-10 years before to
,,
0:07m03.120,0:07m07.56,submit magazines that you published
,,
0:07m05.520,0:07m09.87,language poetry and yet that and
,,
0:07m07.560,0:07m11.96,typically really get no response or
,,
0:07m09.870,0:07m13.95,maybe a slip saying sorry this journal
,,
0:07m11.969,0:07m14.94,is no longer in circulation and because
,,
0:07m13.950,0:07m16.22,of the only way I heard about them in
,,
0:07m14.940,0:07m19.71,the first place was from the library
,,
0:07m16.229,0:07m22.32,copies or right so I had no contact with
,,
0:07m19.710,0:07m24.18,any of the people involved and so the
,,
0:07m22.320,0:07m26.19,internet changed that yeah now
,,
0:07m24.180,0:07m28.16,publishing a few online journals and
,,
0:07m26.190,0:07m31.55,made contacts with pellets that way and
,,
0:07m28.169,0:07m34.11,from then it was pretty rapid that from
,,
0:07m31.550,0:07m37.32,an initial chapbook that was published
,,
0:07m34.110,0:07m39.74,by canning editions by patrick durga in
,,
0:07m37.320,0:07m42.77,2001 called hovercraft
,,
0:07m39.740,0:07m45.81,then my first book in 2003 was gearhead
,,
0:07m42.779,0:07m49.16,nation tougher disguises press amended
,,
0:07m45.810,0:07m51.36,by James Metz another book next year
,,
0:07m49.169,0:07m53.72,Mike McGee's combo books A Thousand
,,
0:07m51.360,0:07m56.94,Devils a couple books at the end of the
,,
0:07m53.729,0:08m01.08,decade from edge rot sniff and roof
,,
0:07m56.940,0:08m02.90,James sherry and lots of journals and
,,
0:08m01.080,0:08m05.52,anthologies stuffing in the middle there
,,
0:08m02.909,0:08m07.71,yeah um a few other chat books I have
,,
0:08m05.520,0:08m09.65,from the collective dimension and then
,,
0:08m07.710,0:08m12.00,and now your your project you're working
,,
0:08m09.659,0:08m13.46,on is the sonograms that's my chief
,,
0:08m12.000,0:08m15.69,project yeah okay but you have other
,,
0:08m13.469,0:08m17.34,ones going that's well that's the one
,,
0:08m15.690,0:08m19.11,that I consciously think of that as a
,,
0:08m17.340,0:08m21.90,project in the middle of occasionally
,,
0:08m19.110,0:08m28.16,I'll write something just on the weimar
,,
0:08m21.900,0:08m29.88,okay that's the main project so so we're
,,
0:08m28.169,0:08m31.19,going to talk about it in intimate in a
,,
0:08m29.880,0:08m32.37,like a couple different steps with the
,,
0:08m31.199,0:08m35.19,writing process and we're going to go
,,
0:08m32.370,0:08m36.57,through kind of how it was in the early
,,
0:08m35.190,0:08m39.00,stages of your writing and how it's
,,
0:08m36.570,0:08m41.45,changed and so I have that might sort of
,,
0:08m39.000,0:08m42.93,my the kind of way of thinking about it
,,
0:08m41.459,0:08m44.88,is like because the compositional stage
,,
0:08m42.930,0:08m46.47,which is where you're kind of creating
,,
0:08m44.880,0:08m47.36,it and you have the revision stage and
,,
0:08m46.470,0:08m48.92,then you have
,,
0:08m47.360,0:08m49.85,kind of organizational archival states
,,
0:08m48.920,0:08m51.56,which is where you're putting it into
,,
0:08m49.850,0:08m53.99,books and getting it published and so
,,
0:08m51.560,0:08m55.67,those are the three stages to talk about
,,
0:08m53.990,0:08m57.14,but then and how those have changed over
,,
0:08m55.670,0:09m00.35,the course of sort of like three by
,,
0:08m57.140,0:09m01.76,three so when you first started writing
,,
0:09m00.350,0:09m02.60,and this is even before you started
,,
0:09m01.760,0:09m04.22,writing professionally I think maybe
,,
0:09m02.600,0:09m05.95,before when you were like trying to find
,,
0:09m04.220,0:09m07.51,those language language journal or
,,
0:09m05.959,0:09m09.68,language book your journals Oh
,,
0:09m07.519,0:09m11.32,I mean how what was your composition how
,,
0:09m09.680,0:09m12.86,are you writing like what were you doing
,,
0:09m11.329,0:09m15.41,it's really hard to reconstruct
,,
0:09m12.860,0:09m17.48,something that long ago I don't think I
,,
0:09m15.410,0:09m19.88,have much of a method okay I think I was
,,
0:09m17.480,0:09m22.73,really just kind of feeling around the
,,
0:09m19.880,0:09m24.41,dark yeah so I took a couple you know I
,,
0:09m22.730,0:09m26.89,took a couple of creative writing
,,
0:09m24.410,0:09m29.00,classes in junior college took one is an
,,
0:09m26.899,0:09m33.58,undergrad that didn't really work for me
,,
0:09m29.000,0:09m38.81,um I'm gonna ask I didn't do anything
,,
0:09m33.589,0:09m40.19,for me yeah and and yeah and then I was
,,
0:09m38.810,0:09m42.16,just occasionally feel inspired to write
,,
0:09m40.190,0:09m46.22,something I mean it was very uh
,,
0:09m42.160,0:09m48.35,shapeless yeah and oh yeah so how did
,,
0:09m46.220,0:09m50.30,you come to find the writing that you
,,
0:09m48.350,0:09m52.07,liked I mean to find the language poetry
,,
0:09m50.300,0:09m53.20,to find that the journal decision that
,,
0:09m52.070,0:09m55.25,you were sending out yeah well I don't
,,
0:09m53.209,0:09m59.32,remember what led me to adjust you know
,,
0:09m55.250,0:10m00.94,surfing the web one of the journals one
,,
0:09m59.329,0:10m03.82,of the very first journals that caught
,,
0:10m00.949,0:10m06.41,my attention was combo edited by Mike
,,
0:10m03.829,0:10m08.60,McKee and they published Clark Coolidge
,,
0:10m06.410,0:10m11.77,and other language poets and younger
,,
0:10m08.600,0:10m13.97,poets I hadn't heard of and it was a it
,,
0:10m11.779,0:10m15.69,was at least some of it was online I
,,
0:10m13.970,0:10m21.44,think I remember correctly it was like
,,
0:10m15.699,0:10m24.62,limited digital yeah sampling and I just
,,
0:10m21.440,0:10m26.26,emailed him but in said hey how does one
,,
0:10m24.620,0:10m28.57,go about this submitting work or
,,
0:10m26.269,0:10m29.99,something like that yeah he liked the
,,
0:10m28.579,0:10m32.12,work and I published in there several
,,
0:10m29.990,0:10m33.94,times the same thing with a kenning
,,
0:10m32.120,0:10m36.58,which is also a journal dr. Jergens
,,
0:10m33.949,0:10m39.41,journal I think my first publication
,,
0:10m36.589,0:10m43.94,actually was in fourteen hills okay from
,,
0:10m39.410,0:10m45.64,Samsa to say I went to a group reading
,,
0:10m43.940,0:10m48.89,for the contributors to that issue and
,,
0:10m45.649,0:10m50.54,that a lot of area poets that so I
,,
0:10m48.890,0:10m52.00,established a connection with I figure
,,
0:10m50.540,0:10m54.14,what the original question was no but
,,
0:10m52.000,0:10m56.56,it's fine I mean this that's actually
,,
0:10m54.140,0:10m58.91,kind of where I'm so dumb and then so I
,,
0:10m56.569,0:10m59.92,guess until you're here your writing
,,
0:10m58.910,0:11m01.74,styles in the beginning
,,
0:10m59.920,0:11m03.79,the ways of composition you are kind of
,,
0:11m01.749,0:11m05.49,formless oh yeah in the calm yeah how do
,,
0:11m03.790,0:11m07.02,they start to progress then I mean over
,,
0:11m05.499,0:11m08.52,the net what's the sort of next step and
,,
0:11m07.029,0:11m10.17,that's actually pretty easy to answer
,,
0:11m08.529,0:11m11.70,because it's kind of echo at least so
,,
0:11m10.179,0:11m14.61,far it's been sort of a really distinct
,,
0:11m11.709,0:11m16.86,three-stage process so great yeah like
,,
0:11m14.619,0:11m18.48,it actually entered according to the
,,
0:11m16.869,0:11m20.58,terms of the question yeah so that
,,
0:11m18.489,0:11m23.31,earliest work and this would be
,,
0:11m20.589,0:11m25.89,everything up through you know the
,,
0:11m23.319,0:11m27.12,period I'm talking about yeah was just
,,
0:11m25.899,0:11m29.85,basically I don't know how quite how to
,,
0:11m27.129,0:11m31.74,describe an organic or freehand or you
,,
0:11m29.859,0:11m34.26,know just making stuff up and writing it
,,
0:11m31.749,0:11m36.57,down hmm words would come into my head
,,
0:11m34.269,0:11m39.27,that's a thing I'll put them on the page
,,
0:11m36.579,0:11m42.18,yeah um so typically I was just you know
,,
0:11m39.279,0:11m44.25,type it would be like and I like trying
,,
0:11m42.189,0:11m46.20,to compose a musical piece or something
,,
0:11m44.259,0:11m51.56,like what good what should go after this
,,
0:11m46.209,0:11m55.62,how can I complete this rhythm or yeah a
,,
0:11m51.569,0:11m58.48,set of images or something like that and
,,
0:11m55.629,0:12m01.17,then that began to change with real
,,
0:11m58.480,0:12m03.36,again I'd say 2000 2001 I met Gary
,,
0:12m01.179,0:12m08.16,Sullivan and other members of the flarf
,,
0:12m03.369,0:12m11.94,group in that itself had that second
,,
0:12m08.169,0:12m14.43,stage had kalak two stages at first I
,,
0:12m11.949,0:12m16.80,became acquainted with Gary's writing on
,,
0:12m14.439,0:12m19.02,email lists that we were both on writing
,,
0:12m16.809,0:12m22.77,just for a joke he wrote like some New
,,
0:12m19.029,0:12m24.85,Year's poem or something like that that
,,
0:12m22.779,0:12m26.04,he called a fluff fluff was embedded
,,
0:12m24.850,0:12m27.51,name for the method it was just
,,
0:12m26.049,0:12m29.73,basically writing the stupidest most
,,
0:12m27.519,0:12m32.01,shapeless thing you can think of yeah so
,,
0:12m29.739,0:12m36.45,it's just full of nonsense and
,,
0:12m32.019,0:12m39.99,obscenities and static noises and no
,,
0:12m36.459,0:12m41.86,real shape or form other than just yeah
,,
0:12m39.999,0:12m47.01,bass roughly being broken into lines
,,
0:12m41.860,0:12m48.57,mm-hmm and he and I had a few other
,,
0:12m47.019,0:12m50.55,people start doing this just for fun on
,,
0:12m48.579,0:12m54.51,our own we created our own email list
,,
0:12m50.559,0:12m57.03,okay just so we could end up through the
,,
0:12m54.519,0:12m59.82,forge and stories out there yeah yeah
,,
0:12m57.039,0:13m01.53,about but is it just for my fifties it
,,
0:12m59.829,0:13m03.30,started on a different email list and
,,
0:13m01.539,0:13m04.92,then it moved to it that's right
,,
0:13m03.309,0:13m06.63,and and I guess really it started the
,,
0:13m04.929,0:13m07.62,release I could have if I'm correct
,,
0:13m06.639,0:13m12.87,about something
,,
0:13m07.620,0:13m15.15,with Gary related to me that he sent a
,,
0:13m12.870,0:13m19.02,poem into one of those online vanity
,,
0:13m15.150,0:13m20.58,pricings very calm yeah and the short
,,
0:13m19.020,0:13m23.40,short version trying to get rejected
,,
0:13m20.580,0:13m24.90,right and it really slow just the
,,
0:13m23.400,0:13m28.26,stupidest thing you can think of and it
,,
0:13m24.900,0:13m29.82,was accepting quote it was accepted for
,,
0:13m28.260,0:13m31.89,consideration for the anthology which II
,,
0:13m29.820,0:13m33.30,didn't pay for great now if you actually
,,
0:13m31.890,0:13m37.52,are dumb enough to go through with that
,,
0:13m33.300,0:13m39.08,yeah so that so that was the the origin
,,
0:13m37.529,0:13m42.45,but nothing he just started writing more
,,
0:13m39.089,0:13m44.01,of them on the email list even after he
,,
0:13m42.450,0:13m47.43,realized he couldn't get rejected right
,,
0:13m44.010,0:13m51.77,because yeah fun yeah and so a group of
,,
0:13m47.430,0:13m53.40,us distribution pardon me yeah we're on
,,
0:13m51.779,0:13m56.13,this list and then eventually I think it
,,
0:13m53.400,0:13m57.75,was drew Gardiner who introduced a
,,
0:13m56.130,0:13m59.82,method I'm in the middle of all this
,,
0:13m57.750,0:14m03.08,shapeless writing of using Google search
,,
0:13m59.820,0:14m05.13,results okay just going to a google
,,
0:14m03.089,0:14m07.17,google page doing usually like a
,,
0:14m05.130,0:14m09.00,combination search for like two or three
,,
0:14m07.170,0:14m11.16,terms that you don't expect to see on
,,
0:14m09.000,0:14m12.75,the same page together right and then
,,
0:14m11.160,0:14m14.90,just using that initial search result
,,
0:14m12.750,0:14m17.73,page as a base from which to collage
,,
0:14m14.900,0:14m19.58,excerpts not following the links just
,,
0:14m17.730,0:14m21.12,just just the language that shows up in
,,
0:14m19.589,0:14m23.70,the Google kind of like the cached so
,,
0:14m21.120,0:14m25.62,that's right yeah yeah so my typical
,,
0:14m23.700,0:14m28.52,process this is oh this is the second
,,
0:14m25.620,0:14m30.95,stages have a big second stage where for
,,
0:14m28.529,0:14m33.87,ten years I basically just wrote Google
,,
0:14m30.959,0:14m36.23,collages okay and is the typical process
,,
0:14m33.870,0:14m38.94,for that was I would you know copy
,,
0:14m36.230,0:14m41.04,however many pages of the search result
,,
0:14m38.940,0:14m42.39,page because you put next base next page
,,
0:14m41.040,0:14m44.58,or just to have a hundred results show
,,
0:14m42.390,0:14m46.23,up on a page or whatever yeah and paste
,,
0:14m44.580,0:14m48.81,that into word and start chiseling it
,,
0:14m46.230,0:14m50.45,down okay and rearranging and shuffling
,,
0:14m48.810,0:14m51.90,the contents and casually cheating a
,,
0:14m50.459,0:14m55.41,little bit putting a connector word in
,,
0:14m51.900,0:14m58.32,or something yeah Andhra the or maybe
,,
0:14m55.410,0:14m59.94,altering a word that was get out in a
,,
0:14m58.320,0:15m02.45,slightly different grammatical form or
,,
0:14m59.940,0:15m03.87,something yeah but that gets back to
,,
0:15m02.459,0:15m05.76,what we were saying about you know not
,,
0:15m03.870,0:15m07.95,doing print revisions because really
,,
0:15m05.760,0:15m09.81,everything's done with the comic
,,
0:15m07.950,0:15m13.62,refrigerator magnets and just shuffling
,,
0:15m09.810,0:15m14.67,around yeah yeah and I guess printing
,,
0:15m13.620,0:15m16.14,out a page I could look at that I think
,,
0:15m14.670,0:15m16.74,oh well if I brought some of this down
,,
0:15m16.140,0:15m18.56,here
,,
0:15m16.740,0:15m20.69,see it up I'd never did that
,,
0:15m18.560,0:15m23.27,so no great right no I mean it makes
,,
0:15m20.690,0:15m24.59,your kind of computer-generated
,,
0:15m23.270,0:15m26.96,yeah and part of your front of it was
,,
0:15m24.590,0:15m29.20,using the computer as a kind of kind of
,,
0:15m26.960,0:15m31.22,canvas yeah you know those
,,
0:15m29.200,0:15m34.27,consciousnesses something pleasing about
,,
0:15m31.220,0:15m36.02,pulling the components around and almost
,,
0:15m34.279,0:15m37.43,physically moving them around that that
,,
0:15m36.020,0:15m39.20,digital space and when you're when
,,
0:15m37.430,0:15m41.93,you're copying the page you just say
,,
0:15m39.200,0:15m43.55,like control all grab it drop it in do
,,
0:15m41.930,0:15m45.44,you get like images and whatnot with
,,
0:15m43.550,0:15m47.02,that or you you just like drag this
,,
0:15m45.440,0:15m48.74,thing up and just get the text and paste
,,
0:15m47.029,0:15m51.11,it yeah oh typically I'm going on a Mac
,,
0:15m48.740,0:15m54.35,or just select the whole page yeah
,,
0:15m51.110,0:15m55.73,copy paste I mean and there weren't any
,,
0:15m54.350,0:15m57.89,images because it's just the result
,,
0:15m55.730,0:15m59.57,pages the result page okay what you
,,
0:15m57.890,0:16m02.60,would get was a lot of the kind of like
,,
0:15m59.570,0:16m05.42,red or blue text or purple text yeah
,,
0:16m02.600,0:16m07.76,with the URLs and headers and things
,,
0:16m05.420,0:16m09.23,like that and typically I would just you
,,
0:16m07.760,0:16m11.00,know first stage of going through the
,,
0:16m09.230,0:16m13.97,the manuscript to be to remove all that
,,
0:16m11.000,0:16m16.64,kind of junk text it's all junk but
,,
0:16m13.970,0:16m20.42,right no no but yeah there were just
,,
0:16m16.640,0:16m23.81,numbers and code okay that's all I had
,,
0:16m20.420,0:16m27.26,left was you know recognizable words and
,,
0:16m23.810,0:16m30.14,maybe numbers and in getting rid of that
,,
0:16m27.260,0:16m31.73,of that junk text were you reading at
,,
0:16m30.140,0:16m33.68,the same time were you starting to kind
,,
0:16m31.730,0:16m35.60,of get a sense of what you would gotten
,,
0:16m33.680,0:16m37.07,or was it just like kind of a rope let's
,,
0:16m35.600,0:16m39.14,get rid of this and then I'm looking at
,,
0:16m37.070,0:16m41.27,it I'm attic based on my memory usually
,,
0:16m39.140,0:16m42.77,it would just be a rote thing of just
,,
0:16m41.270,0:16m46.94,okay first let's get rid of everything I
,,
0:16m42.770,0:16m48.80,know is not actual you know in most
,,
0:16m46.940,0:16m49.97,cases not usually usable text I mean
,,
0:16m48.800,0:16m51.56,there might be some little strings of
,,
0:16m49.970,0:16m53.21,code where think oh that's kind of cool
,,
0:16m51.560,0:16m56.24,just by itself I'll weave that in yeah
,,
0:16m53.210,0:16m58.88,okay it was mostly an automatic process
,,
0:16m56.240,0:17m02.00,of just let me reduce it to just letters
,,
0:16m58.880,0:17m05.15,and you know black text yeah as opposed
,,
0:17m02.000,0:17m07.52,to colored blink text sure and then I'd
,,
0:17m05.150,0:17m08.81,have then from that page would be done
,,
0:17m07.520,0:17m12.53,on how interesting this could possibly
,,
0:17m08.810,0:17m14.20,be to anybody but I mean if it will be
,,
0:17m12.530,0:17m15.19,left up to that will be a lot of things
,,
0:17m14.209,0:17m17.87,like the lip seeds
,,
0:17m15.199,0:17m19.91,yeah our dashes or you know because
,,
0:17m17.870,0:17m21.23,they'll be like partial phrases then
,,
0:17m19.910,0:17m23.20,ellipses then the beginning of another
,,
0:17m21.230,0:17m26.51,phrase and now the search results would
,,
0:17m23.209,0:17m27.89,be arranged on the page yeah so then I
,,
0:17m26.510,0:17m29.99,might just say okay I'm going to get rid
,,
0:17m27.890,0:17m31.65,of them all or most of the ellipses or
,,
0:17m29.990,0:17m35.70,dashes or
,,
0:17m31.650,0:17m37.56,I would also I think I know I would also
,,
0:17m35.700,0:17m40.56,go through and just for the sake of
,,
0:17m37.560,0:17m41.97,competition change case select
,,
0:17m40.560,0:17m45.42,everything in change case to lowercase
,,
0:17m41.970,0:17m47.13,okay just to get rid of all the blocks
,,
0:17m45.420,0:17m50.97,of long blocks of caps of a kind of
,,
0:17m47.130,0:17m52.32,unwieldy or yeah and then as I was later
,,
0:17m50.970,0:17m54.00,in the process of composition I might
,,
0:17m52.320,0:17m58.50,change some letters back to caps but
,,
0:17m54.000,0:18m00.93,typically for whatever reason the
,,
0:17m58.500,0:18m03.95,default format that upon B no caps
,,
0:18m00.930,0:18m06.78,unless they're required by you know
,,
0:18m03.950,0:18m09.39,convention I mean by which I mean like
,,
0:18m06.780,0:18m11.19,proper names yeah things like that not
,,
0:18m09.390,0:18m14.19,wouldn't capitalized the beginning of a
,,
0:18m11.190,0:18m16.08,line or anything like that right so I
,,
0:18m14.190,0:18m18.24,just start basically once I'm ready to
,,
0:18m16.080,0:18m19.83,actually start composing the poem I'd
,,
0:18m18.240,0:18m23.16,have a powerful many pages full of
,,
0:18m19.830,0:18m25.56,lowercase language yeah in black and
,,
0:18m23.160,0:18m27.42,white and so for the dashes in ellipses
,,
0:18m25.560,0:18m29.25,one I would used to find all and delete
,,
0:18m27.420,0:18m31.23,yeah yeah that would be the quickly I
,,
0:18m29.250,0:18m33.87,learned that pretty quickly that was
,,
0:18m31.230,0:18m36.87,just like find this replace with nothing
,,
0:18m33.870,0:18m41.37,yeah I have just words look at most part
,,
0:18m36.870,0:18m44.19,it some numerals yeah and so and then
,,
0:18m41.370,0:18m47.25,you would get to it and so I mean that's
,,
0:18m44.190,0:18m48.72,almost your prewriting stage in some way
,,
0:18m47.250,0:18m50.82,and then you're to the point where
,,
0:18m48.720,0:18m52.71,you're complement composing the poem or
,,
0:18m50.820,0:18m54.78,whatever word you want to use I mean
,,
0:18m52.710,0:18m58.17,sure where you use I guess yeah then
,,
0:18m54.780,0:19m00.39,after that I mean a once I just because
,,
0:18m58.170,0:19m02.13,of the nature of the the way it was
,,
0:19m00.390,0:19m07.50,copied onto the page what usually end up
,,
0:19m02.130,0:19m09.45,with would be something like tercets
,,
0:19m07.500,0:19m11.16,or something that looked on the page
,,
0:19m09.450,0:19m13.11,already kind of like tercets which is
,,
0:19m11.160,0:19m14.55,what a lot of the phones not all of them
,,
0:19m13.110,0:19m15.30,but a lot of it would end up being
,,
0:19m14.550,0:19m17.46,intercepts
,,
0:19m15.300,0:19m20.04,yeah so just keep that and sometimes two
,,
0:19m17.460,0:19m23.07,lines sometimes three lines sometimes
,,
0:19m20.040,0:19m25.11,longer sometimes more longer stanzas but
,,
0:19m23.070,0:19m27.54,sometimes just that accidental form
,,
0:19m25.110,0:19m30.30,would give me a kind of a starting point
,,
0:19m27.540,0:19m32.19,okay I've got groups of three lines but
,,
0:19m30.300,0:19m33.33,I want to move this line from this one
,,
0:19m32.190,0:19m34.50,up here to this other one and it would
,,
0:19m33.330,0:19m38.88,balance out the other one with the other
,,
0:19m34.500,0:19m40.29,line or phrase so like I said it would
,,
0:19m38.880,0:19m41.61,be like refrigerator magnets and
,,
0:19m40.290,0:19m42.17,although sometimes the full phrases
,,
0:19m41.610,0:19m46.52,instead of
,,
0:19m42.179,0:19m48.09,individual words yeah and in the middle
,,
0:19m46.529,0:19m50.42,that process I initially get rid of most
,,
0:19m48.090,0:19m51.99,of the language you know sometime which
,,
0:19m50.429,0:19m53.19,I just could not figure out anything
,,
0:19m51.990,0:19m55.04,interesting to do it it was just
,,
0:19m53.190,0:19m56.39,wouldn't be interesting yeah so the
,,
0:19m55.049,0:19m58.74,finished poems might be anywhere from
,,
0:19m56.399,0:20m01.04,you know a third of a page to a couple
,,
0:19m58.740,0:20m03.72,pages long but I'd be starting sometimes
,,
0:20m01.049,0:20m07.08,with like ten pages then you just go and
,,
0:20m03.720,0:20m09.17,delete delete delete range shuffle and
,,
0:20m07.080,0:20m12.09,so what was what was the lower the
,,
0:20m09.179,0:20m14.90,phrases or words or groupings that we
,,
0:20m12.090,0:20m16.76,would catch your eye or catchers or ear
,,
0:20m14.909,0:20m18.86,I mean in what in which was it catching
,,
0:20m16.769,0:20m20.27,I guess - I'd say earlier in the process
,,
0:20m18.869,0:20m22.91,it had more to do with the original
,,
0:20m20.279,0:20m24.05,search for the terms I use T so for
,,
0:20m22.919,0:20m26.58,example my first book to your head
,,
0:20m24.059,0:20m28.08,nation yeah well the bunch of searches
,,
0:20m26.580,0:20m32.49,usually included them on other terms to
,,
0:20m28.080,0:20m34.37,turn deer head yeah and so for that I
,,
0:20m32.490,0:20m36.48,was obviously motivated to keep deer
,,
0:20m34.379,0:20m39.17,head a lot of the time keep that theme
,,
0:20m36.480,0:20m41.07,going or sometimes I would just think
,,
0:20m39.179,0:20m43.52,about phrase I think was funny or
,,
0:20m41.070,0:20m45.45,bizarre and I'd want that to be the
,,
0:20m43.529,0:20m47.46,title and I want to keep a few instances
,,
0:20m45.450,0:20m51.09,of those words in the phone it seems
,,
0:20m47.460,0:20m52.35,like a love several years further along
,,
0:20m51.090,0:20m53.51,in the process I get to the Pyrenean
,,
0:20m52.350,0:20m55.64,really care if the original search term
,,
0:20m53.519,0:20m58.03,search terms showed up at all yeah I
,,
0:20m55.649,0:21m01.61,just wanted to create a kind of a lyric
,,
0:20m58.039,0:21m04.76,construct yeah that was limited for its
,,
0:21m01.619,0:21m07.49,sources to the bank of terms what do you
,,
0:21m04.769,0:21m10.25,think got you to that sort of preference
,,
0:21m07.499,0:21m12.60,was it no idea no idea I think just
,,
0:21m10.259,0:21m14.30,getting bored with the regularity of the
,,
0:21m12.600,0:21m15.89,earlier process yes I think worked
,,
0:21m14.309,0:21m17.51,really well for me in the you know some
,,
0:21m15.899,0:21m18.80,of the original first project right
,,
0:21m17.519,0:21m22.40,because they were kind of more
,,
0:21m18.809,0:21m23.87,thematically motivated the you know the
,,
0:21m22.409,0:21m26.39,deer heads thing was supposed to be kind
,,
0:21m23.879,0:21m31.52,of a metaphor for yeah imperialism or
,,
0:21m26.399,0:21m32.99,something out um but but it went on I
,,
0:21m31.529,0:21m35.70,just really gotten became more concerned
,,
0:21m32.999,0:21m38.99,with just wanting a verbal shape or
,,
0:21m35.700,0:21m42.29,sculpture yeah I found interesting so
,,
0:21m38.999,0:21m45.11,and you find then that those later poems
,,
0:21m42.299,0:21m49.32,are more like readable or I mean
,,
0:21m45.119,0:21m51.21,probably I mean I think that's a good
,,
0:21m49.320,0:21m52.51,time laughing but I mean you know I
,,
0:21m51.210,0:21m53.53,think one person's definition
,,
0:21m52.519,0:21m55.87,of readable is very different from
,,
0:21m53.539,0:21m57.32,another's yeah because I honestly I
,,
0:21m55.879,0:21m58.84,think some people would look at whether
,,
0:21m57.320,0:22m00.04,it's early in the stage or later in
,,
0:21m58.849,0:22m04.07,those days what they think this isn't
,,
0:22m00.049,0:22m06.20,poetry right now this is just spam or
,,
0:22m04.070,0:22m10.45,something they're just garbage from the
,,
0:22m06.200,0:22m15.16,internet yeah and you know I mean but I
,,
0:22m10.459,0:22m16.96,think I don't even think that the divide
,,
0:22m15.169,0:22m19.27,is allowing experimental or traditional
,,
0:22m16.969,0:22m20.77,necessarily because frankly a lot of the
,,
0:22m19.279,0:22m23.26,biggest critics of flower for
,,
0:22m20.779,0:22m25.00,experimental about it right so I think
,,
0:22m23.269,0:22m28.03,it really just had to do with it whether
,,
0:22m25.009,0:22m31.48,a person has that kind of mind that
,,
0:22m28.039,0:22m35.14,likes arrangement and that says rather
,,
0:22m31.489,0:22m36.40,than you know if someone said that me
,,
0:22m35.149,0:22m38.45,rephrase that I think it's kind of
,,
0:22m36.409,0:22m41.45,whether someone's drawn to verbal
,,
0:22m38.450,0:22m42.55,arrangement over and above verbal scene
,,
0:22m41.450,0:22m45.04,okay
,,
0:22m42.559,0:22m46.60,and I mean that's what drew me
,,
0:22m45.049,0:22m49.87,originally developed by Clark Coolidge
,,
0:22m46.609,0:22m51.85,or other language pellets or you know it
,,
0:22m49.879,0:22m52.72,didn't matter what it said yeah in the
,,
0:22m51.859,0:22m55.60,traditional sense
,,
0:22m52.729,0:22m59.95,I was interesting like wow I can put
,,
0:22m55.609,0:23m01.33,those words in that place right and so I
,,
0:22m59.959,0:23m04.12,don't really know what's readable you
,,
0:23m01.339,0:23m06.49,know to the quote average person yeah
,,
0:23m04.129,0:23m08.11,yeah there's an average person I guess
,,
0:23m06.499,0:23m09.70,in terms of you enters of your own
,,
0:23m08.119,0:23m10.96,reading or in terms of your own sort of
,,
0:23m09.709,0:23m13.15,confident I mean like when you're making
,,
0:23m10.969,0:23m15.28,those things I mean did you find those
,,
0:23m13.159,0:23m17.80,later pumps to be more pleasurable to
,,
0:23m15.289,0:23m18.76,make I mean was there like I don't know
,,
0:23m17.809,0:23m20.41,what they're I mean you said they're
,,
0:23m18.769,0:23m22.09,more like alia there was more of a lyric
,,
0:23m20.419,0:23m23.53,vent to though I don't know other people
,,
0:23m22.099,0:23m26.25,would see it as lyric just as early but
,,
0:23m23.539,0:23m28.90,yeah I mean I think so I think that it
,,
0:23m26.259,0:23m30.79,inevitably it became almost at least
,,
0:23m28.909,0:23m33.37,from my perspective more traditional
,,
0:23m30.799,0:23m35.26,okay I mean I don't think other people
,,
0:23m33.379,0:23m37.70,are going to yeah a little get to say
,,
0:23m35.269,0:23m40.30,you call this traditional but but I felt
,,
0:23m37.700,0:23m43.03,like I was kind of going back to the
,,
0:23m40.309,0:23m46.15,kinds of things that pleased me about
,,
0:23m43.039,0:23m47.49,older forms of poetry and so so even if
,,
0:23m46.159,0:23m50.77,the fonts themselves have like
,,
0:23m47.499,0:23m55.66,ridiculous vocabulary and images and you
,,
0:23m50.779,0:23m58.27,know to junk food and
,,
0:23m55.660,0:24m00.22,porn site terminology or whatever else
,,
0:23m58.270,0:24m01.57,comes off the internet yeah I'd be
,,
0:24m00.220,0:24m04.00,looking for a rhythm I'll be looking at
,,
0:24m01.570,0:24m06.07,him I'm very influenced by somebody like
,,
0:24m04.000,0:24m10.30,clark Coolidge on that level right kind
,,
0:24m06.070,0:24m12.49,of a the jazz advanced mode composition
,,
0:24m10.300,0:24m14.47,and so I guess I mean how are you
,,
0:24m12.490,0:24m17.16,constructing your lines then I mean if
,,
0:24m14.470,0:24m19.06,you're looking for that sort of rhythm I
,,
0:24m17.160,0:24m21.91,think it's the lines are really just
,,
0:24m19.060,0:24m24.04,determined by the by the by the shape of
,,
0:24m21.910,0:24m25.66,the phrases mm-hmm I mean for me the
,,
0:24m24.040,0:24m28.18,rhythm comes outward from the words it's
,,
0:24m25.660,0:24m29.23,not it's not like a pentameter rhythm or
,,
0:24m28.180,0:24m32.40,something that's very determined by a
,,
0:24m29.230,0:24m32.40,set length yeah
,,
0:24m32.710,0:24m37.27,not in that project not in those books
,,
0:24m35.380,0:24m39.82,and then were you getting I mean were
,,
0:24m37.270,0:24m41.53,you grabbing we when you grab the phrase
,,
0:24m39.820,0:24m43.06,or a few phrases where those almost
,,
0:24m41.530,0:24m44.32,automatically lines or would you break
,,
0:24m43.060,0:24m46.21,those into different lines
,,
0:24m44.320,0:24m48.07,oh we would defend but usually I do a
,,
0:24m46.210,0:24m49.48,lot of breaking I mean there's a sense
,,
0:24m48.070,0:24m51.70,in which the whole process is kind of
,,
0:24m49.480,0:24m54.19,unnecessary I mean because ultimately
,,
0:24m51.700,0:24m57.85,what I was doing was just manipulating
,,
0:24m54.190,0:24m59.23,the the results so much that I mean I
,,
0:24m57.850,0:25m02.29,would think all time I really don't need
,,
0:24m59.230,0:25m03.91,to go to the internet for this except at
,,
0:25m02.290,0:25m06.58,the level of just I think vocabulary
,,
0:25m03.910,0:25m09.07,yeah yeah maybe beyond that just little
,,
0:25m06.580,0:25m11.44,syntactical clusters right oh I was at
,,
0:25m09.070,0:25m12.79,these four words in a row right I would
,,
0:25m11.440,0:25m15.01,never have come up with these four words
,,
0:25m12.790,0:25m17.11,in a row on my own just trying to think
,,
0:25m15.010,0:25m19.66,of something so what I was looking for
,,
0:25m17.110,0:25m22.09,is really just a palette full of colors
,,
0:25m19.660,0:25m24.49,you like is that the colors I couldn't
,,
0:25m22.090,0:25m26.05,think up by myself there's no human
,,
0:25m24.490,0:25m27.85,being I mean would think of putting
,,
0:25m26.050,0:25m30.28,those things in a pelham because they're
,,
0:25m27.850,0:25m33.01,just you know they're not that there's
,,
0:25m30.280,0:25m34.84,something else at that stage so in terms
,,
0:25m33.010,0:25m36.28,of like your revision strategies for
,,
0:25m34.840,0:25m39.10,these poems I mean in the early stages
,,
0:25m36.280,0:25m40.75,you you had a more I mean it's sort of
,,
0:25m39.100,0:25m45.64,recapping all that you added more intent
,,
0:25m40.750,0:25m47.50,towards representing the search in some
,,
0:25m45.640,0:25m49.39,very fundamental way and then later it
,,
0:25m47.500,0:25m51.01,started to become you we wanted to kind
,,
0:25m49.390,0:25m55.84,of represent an accumulation an
,,
0:25m51.010,0:25m57.64,arrangement more yeah lyrically or more
,,
0:25m55.840,0:25m59.61,more more in a way to do the kind of
,,
0:25m57.640,0:26m03.07,traditional and your traditions of
,,
0:25m59.610,0:26m04.66,poetry cuz the one constant was the
,,
0:26m03.070,0:26m05.87,importance of the idea that it was
,,
0:26m04.660,0:26m08.80,generated by the search
,,
0:26m05.870,0:26m11.53,and I think that was an antic that is a
,,
0:26m08.809,0:26m13.42,factor for the reai think you know I
,,
0:26m11.539,0:26m16.78,don't see any need to mask the the
,,
0:26m13.429,0:26m18.16,method I think one of the pleasures for
,,
0:26m16.789,0:26m20.05,me of reading other work like that by
,,
0:26m18.169,0:26m22.46,other people is knowing oh they did this
,,
0:26m20.059,0:26m25.49,by using a particular procedure right oh
,,
0:26m22.460,0:26m28.49,and I'm still most interested in how how
,,
0:26m25.490,0:26m29.80,the finished work affects me of the
,,
0:26m28.490,0:26m31.07,knowledge that it was created in a
,,
0:26m29.809,0:26m33.55,certain way something I can't separate I
,,
0:26m31.070,0:26m35.60,don't want to separate it yeah so I you
,,
0:26m33.559,0:26m37.90,know I look fraying the work all the way
,,
0:26m35.600,0:26m39.38,through it's like this was you know if I
,,
0:26m37.909,0:26m40.70,were to mention it which I had occasion
,,
0:26m39.380,0:26m42.95,to do I you know the beginning of the
,,
0:26m40.700,0:26m45.79,book oh yeah / no this was created by
,,
0:26m42.950,0:26m47.27,using Google search methods yeah so I
,,
0:26m45.799,0:26m50.12,think it helps of people going to of
,,
0:26m47.270,0:26m51.98,that knowledge sure but like you're
,,
0:26m50.120,0:26m55.78,saying I didn't necessarily want the
,,
0:26m51.980,0:26m58.25,search to retain some like imprint of
,,
0:26m55.789,0:27m01.13,the all the original conditions of the
,,
0:26m58.250,0:27m03.40,search even maybe in the first book the
,,
0:27m01.130,0:27m05.69,to some extent yeah for example into
,,
0:27m03.409,0:27m09.83,your head nation I not only kept a lot
,,
0:27m05.690,0:27m12.83,more longer clusters of their original
,,
0:27m09.830,0:27m15.15,syntactic clusters so keep a bunch of
,,
0:27m12.830,0:27m18.50,ellipses and create yeah visual
,,
0:27m15.159,0:27m20.60,groupings with them all these kind of
,,
0:27m18.500,0:27m22.88,graphic reminders of what the process
,,
0:27m20.600,0:27m24.08,was I just felt less and going to do
,,
0:27m22.880,0:27m25.34,that as I went because it didn't seem
,,
0:27m24.080,0:27m27.20,necessary for the different kinds of
,,
0:27m25.340,0:27m29.87,poems I was going into great great um
,,
0:27m27.200,0:27m32.77,what about the prose poems in these
,,
0:27m29.870,0:27m34.78,enemies in this tradition I mean like
,,
0:27m32.779,0:27m38.11,how did those come about oh yeah I'm the
,,
0:27m34.789,0:27m40.52,same thing but they're I mean they're
,,
0:27m38.110,0:27m42.83,the original search terms did we make
,,
0:27m40.520,0:27m44.75,did remain much more important yeah
,,
0:27m42.830,0:27m46.78,because I mean you have a phrase like
,,
0:27m44.750,0:27m49.07,and then she said you know or something
,,
0:27m46.789,0:27m51.50,very fixed and obviously in order to
,,
0:27m49.070,0:27m52.58,keep the shades of the throughout the
,,
0:27m51.500,0:27m57.08,bottom I'm going to have to keep coming
,,
0:27m52.580,0:27m58.54,back to that tag great so and then there
,,
0:27m57.080,0:28m00.89,the goal was usually to make it seem
,,
0:27m58.549,0:28m02.09,seamless like it's the one subject you
,,
0:28m00.890,0:28m05.99,know saying something over and over
,,
0:28m02.090,0:28m08.00,again so yeah that would be an exception
,,
0:28m05.990,0:28m09.78,know whenever I do it although I think I
,,
0:28m08.000,0:28m12.55,also did some prose ones where I didn't
,,
0:28m09.789,0:28m15.26,stick that much to whatever original
,,
0:28m12.559,0:28m17.17,grammatical framing Reglan I don't
,,
0:28m15.260,0:28m18.26,remember a handout or which ones but
,,
0:28m17.179,0:28m22.58,yeah
,,
0:28m18.260,0:28m29.18,um so I trying to be kind of Christmas
,,
0:28m22.580,0:28m30.50,wait amento it's worth that I mean well
,,
0:28m29.180,0:28m33.05,I mean I guess this is one of questions
,,
0:28m30.500,0:28m35.54,I asked a lot is where you kind of were
,,
0:28m33.050,0:28m36.95,these divisions driven by sound I mean
,,
0:28m35.540,0:28m38.54,were you reading them out loud to get a
,,
0:28m36.950,0:28m40.04,better kind of rhythm or did you have
,,
0:28m38.540,0:28m43.13,like meanings or themes that you wanted
,,
0:28m40.040,0:28m44.06,to this is I mean especially yeah that's
,,
0:28m43.130,0:28m46.87,a good question
,,
0:28m44.060,0:28m49.67,I think sound was probably usually the
,,
0:28m46.870,0:28m52.73,least tied for the primary operator
,,
0:28m49.670,0:28m54.56,there yeah and what would what would
,,
0:28m52.730,0:28m59.42,determine a line break then in terms of
,,
0:28m54.560,0:29m01.43,sound that's a typical question even for
,,
0:28m59.420,0:29m03.38,like traditional know that writing write
,,
0:29m01.430,0:29m05.18,your 30 days in the hospitalization
,,
0:29m03.380,0:29m07.37,drives me crazy in workshop on a
,,
0:29m05.180,0:29m08.84,teachings life on the one hand wanting
,,
0:29m07.370,0:29m11.36,people to think about line breaks and
,,
0:29m08.840,0:29m12.86,what motivates them what they have and
,,
0:29m11.360,0:29m16.60,the other hand getting so tired of
,,
0:29m12.860,0:29m16.60,getting bogged down completely arbitrary
,,
0:29m17.020,0:29m21.65,theories of like the line break at the
,,
0:29m19.760,0:29m24.13,end in some ways it's like a very
,,
0:29m21.650,0:29m27.35,important thing in some ways it's just
,,
0:29m24.130,0:29m28.70,totally random I mean writing every poem
,,
0:29m27.350,0:29m29.69,obviously and then quote especially
,,
0:29m28.700,0:29m31.97,obviously if you're working in a fixed
,,
0:29m29.690,0:29m34.88,form it's yeah I can care of a free
,,
0:29m31.970,0:29m37.34,verse or procedural or other kinds of
,,
0:29m34.880,0:29m40.31,things where the line breaks are kind of
,,
0:29m37.340,0:29m43.58,post facto consideration yeah I mean
,,
0:29m40.310,0:29m45.56,really is just going on my nerve you
,,
0:29m43.580,0:29m47.96,know just what strikes me at the moment
,,
0:29m45.560,0:29m49.40,is seemed like a good way to keep the
,,
0:29m47.960,0:29m51.74,rhythm going or to create a halt in the
,,
0:29m49.400,0:29m53.63,rhythm or yeah do a little both
,,
0:29m51.740,0:29m56.51,depending where I am in the poem sure
,,
0:29m53.630,0:29m59.09,yeah um did you fit so for it for the
,,
0:29m56.510,0:30m00.95,pretties and what I thought okay what's
,,
0:29m59.090,0:30m03.14,what would be the phrase that you would
,,
0:30m00.950,0:30m05.39,use the muses collage you say who
,,
0:30m03.140,0:30m07.25,collage I see Google sculpt that yeah
,,
0:30m05.390,0:30m09.53,sort of my own scholars area term I kind
,,
0:30m07.250,0:30m12.17,of tried to put out there for it okay
,,
0:30m09.530,0:30m13.79,and then so that's the one that you sort
,,
0:30m12.170,0:30m15.47,of prefer as saying it's like a google
,,
0:30m13.790,0:30m18.83,sculpting yeah that's called me collage
,,
0:30m15.470,0:30m21.11,works to the last words okay and then
,,
0:30m18.830,0:30m23.12,did you save like you know what the
,,
0:30m21.110,0:30m25.31,terms are for each poem and they're
,,
0:30m23.120,0:30m26.30,somewhere where that is recorded no no
,,
0:30m25.310,0:30m27.98,sometimes the thing about that why
,,
0:30m26.300,0:30m29.63,didn't I use a record of like what it
,,
0:30m27.980,0:30m31.04,well how exactly this came about but
,,
0:30m29.630,0:30m34.63,yeah I'm too
,,
0:30m31.049,0:30m37.08,kind of that's it my digital ad for that
,,
0:30m34.639,0:30m39.11,great but like recreated someday but
,,
0:30m37.080,0:30m40.40,using like simulator oh you can't
,,
0:30m39.119,0:30m41.85,because I'm in the Internet has
,,
0:30m40.409,0:30m47.36,completely changed right yeah it's gone
,,
0:30m41.850,0:30m50.00,forever I know so fascinating um and
,,
0:30m47.369,0:30m53.19,then so I guess okay so those are that's
,,
0:30m50.009,0:30m54.86,so we've moved from the first stage the
,,
0:30m53.190,0:30m57.60,second stage and then the two stages of
,,
0:30m54.869,0:30m59.22,that the latter stage of that having run
,,
0:30m57.600,0:31m00.89,up for about ten years you said
,,
0:30m59.220,0:31m03.65,something like that yeah so like I'm
,,
0:31m00.899,0:31m07.49,writing just freeform Oh however you
,,
0:31m03.659,0:31m09.57,want to describe it from like 98 to 200
0:31m07.499,0:31m11.34,so that's very short phrase okay no the
,,
0:31m09.570,0:31m13.64,2nd book A Thousand Devils was kind of
,,
0:31m11.340,0:31m15.84,stuff left over from that stage so okay
,,
0:31m13.649,0:31m17.54,you know that came out 2004 most of the
,,
0:31m15.840,0:31m19.79,headed risen quite a bit earlier and the
,,
0:31m17.549,0:31m21.77,hovercraft is also that to have set via
,,
0:31m19.799,0:31m23.07,that's that initial stage okay and then
,,
0:31m21.779,0:31m25.04,the second stage starts with your head
,,
0:31m23.070,0:31m27.89,nation through breathalyzer and the
,,
0:31m25.049,0:31m29.54,front and the front okay um and then and
,,
0:31m27.899,0:31m32.51,now the project ended so this third
,,
0:31m29.549,0:31m34.08,section then is the sonogram yeah and so
,,
0:31m32.519,0:31m36.05,how did that project come about I should
,,
0:31m34.080,0:31m39.41,just announcing discuss let say I'm
,,
0:31m36.059,0:31m42.21,calling these stages just a convenient
,,
0:31m39.419,0:31m44.63,way of separating well timed it helps my
,,
0:31m42.210,0:31m46.28,honor yeah yeah I just wanted I don't
,,
0:31m44.639,0:31m49.59,think of it necessarily like oh this is
,,
0:31m46.289,0:31m51.29,the you know initiative stage that
,,
0:31m49.590,0:31m53.10,develop into this this is what I happen
,,
0:31m51.299,0:31m54.84,to start doing or stuff to know yeah
,,
0:31m53.100,0:31m59.15,this is not an aggression it's works
,,
0:31m54.840,0:32m00.74,yeah so yeah so sonograms I have forget
,,
0:31m59.159,0:32m02.22,what you I think maybe it's been
,,
0:32m00.749,0:32m03.69,embarassingly a long time now because
,,
0:32m02.220,0:32m07.32,I've been working very slowly on it I've
,,
0:32m03.690,0:32m09.26,yeah a very lazy pellet um the best and
,,
0:32m07.320,0:32m11.10,so I mean if it would have been finished
,,
0:32m09.269,0:32m13.25,a long time ago if I'd kept any schedule
,,
0:32m11.100,0:32m15.62,okay that a little over halfway through
,,
0:32m13.259,0:32m19.85,I had to get started I don't know 200
0:32m15.629,0:32m21.17,or something like that huh and it
,,
0:32m19.859,0:32m23.73,started it with like National Poetry
,,
0:32m21.179,0:32m25.79,Month and I was looking for an idea for
,,
0:32m23.730,0:32m27.29,like just something some quick and easy
,,
0:32m25.799,0:32m29.78,gimmick to allow me to write a poem a
,,
0:32m27.299,0:32m32.15,day mmm I can do something with
,,
0:32m29.789,0:32m34.36,Shakespeare's sonnets yeah so I go to
,,
0:32m32.159,0:32m36.96,the I now find a sonnet I caused to
,,
0:32m34.369,0:32m38.86,paste it into a Word document okay what
,,
0:32m36.960,0:32m42.60,can I do in the next five or 10 minutes
,,
0:32m38.869,0:32m45.87,using this as my source you know
,,
0:32m42.600,0:32m49.45,#NAME?
,,
0:32m45.879,0:32m52.05,tradition yeah I started just kind of
,,
0:32m49.450,0:32m54.27,shuffling and playing with it my cursor
,,
0:32m52.059,0:32m57.24,and thinking and I had been recently
,,
0:32m54.279,0:33m00.85,impressed by a book by Gregory bets
,,
0:32m57.240,0:33m06.34,which I'm now embarrassingly forgetting
,,
0:33m00.850,0:33m08.47,the title of anyway it's a it's a it's a
,,
0:33m06.340,0:33m13.48,book in which he takes a paragraph from
,,
0:33m08.470,0:33m15.63,a speech and rearranges is it rearranges
,,
0:33m13.480,0:33m16.96,it multiple times throughout the book
,,
0:33m15.639,0:33m18.90,just by letter
,,
0:33m16.960,0:33m20.91,so the anagrams of the same paragraph
,,
0:33m18.909,0:33m23.32,uh-huh
,,
0:33m20.919,0:33m25.45,yeah Christian book gave me a copy of
,,
0:33m23.320,0:33m26.88,this as well as I think Gregory Betts
,,
0:33m25.450,0:33m28.50,was with them at the time and today
,,
0:33m26.889,0:33m30.49,here's your like this book and I did I
,,
0:33m28.509,0:33m31.96,thought oh I want to play around as I
,,
0:33m30.490,0:33m35.04,suddenly remembered Oh Hannah Graham as
,,
0:33m31.960,0:33m37.36,well okay this will probably take too
,,
0:33m35.049,0:33m39.30,long we all just start shuffling it
,,
0:33m37.360,0:33m42.27,around like figuring out ways to break
,,
0:33m39.309,0:33m45.07,it up and then I came up with the idea
,,
0:33m42.279,0:33m48.85,of taking each of the lines conceding
,,
0:33m45.070,0:33m50.88,them into an anagram generator because
,,
0:33m48.850,0:33m51.82,that's how it would fit at a time be one
,,
0:33m50.889,0:33m53.86,line okay
,,
0:33m51.820,0:33m55.29,so I did that and every time I feed in
,,
0:33m53.860,0:33m58.41,the antenna group generator would give
,,
0:33m55.299,0:34m00.30,me a choice of a bunch of words lists
,,
0:33m58.419,0:34m01.65,you can make by rearranging that
,,
0:34m00.309,0:34m04.80,particular line I just picked the one I
,,
0:34m01.659,0:34m07.36,like the best and until I have this poem
,,
0:34m04.809,0:34m09.42,that was 14 lines of silly words yeah
,,
0:34m07.360,0:34m12.76,right I thought okay there that's a poem
,,
0:34m09.429,0:34m14.71,and it's not that interesting right and
,,
0:34m12.760,0:34m15.94,kind of cool and in retrospect that's
,,
0:34m14.710,0:34m17.07,another thing I wish I had done it
,,
0:34m15.940,0:34m19.86,should save all these initial
,,
0:34m17.079,0:34m22.88,first-stage word lists yeah that I used
,,
0:34m19.869,0:34m27.63,to create the phones right haven't
,,
0:34m22.889,0:34m29.04,library perfect ranging - what cuz there
,,
0:34m27.639,0:34m31.00,were kind of neat poems about them like
,,
0:34m29.049,0:34m35.47,yeah cheap fake phones on their own
,,
0:34m31.000,0:34m38.04,brain or just just line by line Hannah
,,
0:34m35.470,0:34m40.38,Graham lovely results on it but without
,,
0:34m38.049,0:34m43.83,much syntax or anything which is they're
,,
0:34m40.389,0:34m45.49,just words in a row great so I stopped
,,
0:34m43.839,0:34m46.78,there and thought oh I'm already like 1
0:34m45.490,0:34m48.70,minutes into it that's the ten fifteen
,,
0:34m46.780,0:34m49.99,minutes into it but it'd be more
,,
0:34m48.700,0:34m51.76,interesting if I actually just moved the
,,
0:34m49.990,0:34m53.85,letters throughout the entire poem like
,,
0:34m51.760,0:34m57.22,Gregory Beth did
,,
0:34m53.850,0:35m00.16,and so I did that in like four or five
,,
0:34m57.220,0:35m01.48,hours later it's because I have been
,,
0:35m00.160,0:35m03.73,working on this film for like a big
,,
0:35m01.480,0:35m05.53,chunk of the day yeah and then I got
,,
0:35m03.730,0:35m08.88,really hooked on started doing a bunch
,,
0:35m05.530,0:35m11.32,of them I don't think I kept to the
,,
0:35m08.880,0:35m13.51,whatever it's called national telex
,,
0:35m11.320,0:35m17.53,rewriting not scheduled right uh but I
,,
0:35m13.510,0:35m19.12,think did a few of these I have a you
,,
0:35m17.530,0:35m21.21,know suing like it's stuck them now I'm
,,
0:35m19.120,0:35m23.77,up to like I don't know 90 something of
,,
0:35m21.210,0:35m27.10,it's embarrassing like I said since 200
0:35m23.770,0:35m31.06,I should have a lot more but in there
,,
0:35m27.100,0:35m33.16,100 and 150 for total okay so yeah so I
,,
0:35m31.060,0:35m35.29,would just each bomb is just the Oh an
,,
0:35m33.160,0:35m38.31,anagram yeah and then I would say
,,
0:35m35.290,0:35m41.62,there's a cheat that I'll use all the
,,
0:35m38.310,0:35m42.79,letters to create a new poem in iambic
,,
0:35m41.620,0:35m45.61,pentameter with the original rhyme
,,
0:35m42.790,0:35m48.67,scheme you know ABA B the set of three
,,
0:35m45.610,0:35m50.85,quatrains and a couplet but they all
,,
0:35m48.670,0:35m52.78,have letters left over right never that
,,
0:35m50.850,0:35m55.63,almost never is a problem that don't
,,
0:35m52.780,0:35m59.17,have enough letters usually I don't have
,,
0:35m55.630,0:36m00.67,I can't use them all the poem so so I
,,
0:35m59.170,0:36m02.83,have used those extra letters and make
,,
0:36m00.670,0:36m03.25,up a title and that easily is pretty
,,
0:36m02.830,0:36m06.28,stupid
,,
0:36m03.250,0:36m08.02,yeah well poem stupid but the the title
,,
0:36m06.280,0:36m09.70,isn't in town or anything it's just
,,
0:36m08.020,0:36m15.58,whatever I can do with the leftover
,,
0:36m09.700,0:36m18.04,letter is dead right yeah no so when did
,,
0:36m15.580,0:36m20.77,you so you had C started off with the
,,
0:36m18.040,0:36m22.93,kind of the stuff from the gamma gram
,,
0:36m20.770,0:36m24.43,generator and I'm assuming that's not an
,,
0:36m22.930,0:36m26.41,iambic pentameter I mean like right no
,,
0:36m24.430,0:36m27.94,it's just word we did that so when was
,,
0:36m26.410,0:36m29.29,that the initial move that first day you
,,
0:36m27.940,0:36m31.39,like tonight you're like oh I need to
,,
0:36m29.290,0:36m33.73,make this submit to match up with fields
,,
0:36m31.390,0:36m35.08,reasons on it form yeah yeah that was
,,
0:36m33.730,0:36m37.51,pretty much it I think the very first
,,
0:36m35.080,0:36m43.45,one is the last on this little trading
,,
0:36m37.510,0:36m48.34,card oh I have that here somewhere no
,,
0:36m43.450,0:36m49.66,hiding but yeah yeah frankly I think now
,,
0:36m48.340,0:36m51.85,I look back have definitely the worst of
,,
0:36m49.660,0:36m53.59,all of them because then it's got sort
,,
0:36m51.850,0:36m56.88,of a consistent syntax and grammar but
,,
0:36m53.590,0:36m56.88,it's just complete nonsense
,,
0:36m59.840,0:37m07.59,but it was technically iambic pentameter
,,
0:37m03.030,0:37m10.08,yeah it technically rhymed right half
,,
0:37m07.590,0:37m12.09,rhymed that I got much more stringent
,,
0:37m10.080,0:37m15.78,event on but I'm going to actually make
,,
0:37m12.090,0:37m17.91,them you know construal as meanings even
,,
0:37m15.780,0:37m20.36,if they're a bizarre meanings and okay
,,
0:37m17.910,0:37m22.98,yeah and it's from that first one on you
,,
0:37m20.369,0:37m24.69,were kind of it from from to to so
,,
0:37m22.980,0:37m26.07,wherever you are now 297 you were like
,,
0:37m24.690,0:37m28.77,okay well now I'm going to have more of
,,
0:37m26.070,0:37m29.88,a structure to them well yeah I mean
,,
0:37m28.770,0:37m32.10,they always they always have the
,,
0:37m29.880,0:37m33.48,structure what they I may be overstating
,,
0:37m32.100,0:37m35.28,it and I think the first one's probably
,,
0:37m33.480,0:37m38.22,in some ways has controls the others I
,,
0:37m35.280,0:37m40.44,just I think it was just finding my
,,
0:37m38.220,0:37m42.72,stride like the next few that I go it I
,,
0:37m40.440,0:37m45.93,don't have to reach for these like half
,,
0:37m42.720,0:37m48.51,rhymes or you know I can make that the
,,
0:37m45.930,0:37m52.02,most determined kind of fluid part of it
,,
0:37m48.510,0:37m55.56,right and just then make the absurdity
,,
0:37m52.020,0:37m58.26,stand out and be more you know pleasing
,,
0:37m55.560,0:37m59.76,release I mean you did think they got
,,
0:37m58.260,0:38m01.98,better as you did and I was sort of
,,
0:37m59.760,0:38m04.32,interested in it from from your early
,,
0:38m01.980,0:38m06.84,lark stuff to the front to I mean like
,,
0:38m04.320,0:38m08.70,it does seem that there's I don't know
,,
0:38m06.840,0:38m11.31,for my in my face I think it's better
,,
0:38m08.700,0:38m12.63,and so I'm wondering like what how do
,,
0:38m11.310,0:38m14.55,you think of it that way I mean is it
,,
0:38m12.630,0:38m15.86,just from is it from the practice is it
,,
0:38m14.550,0:38m18.06,I think it I think really is that simple
,,
0:38m15.869,0:38m22.23,I think after the first one or two yeah
,,
0:38m18.060,0:38m26.57,I just got had more practice working
,,
0:38m22.230,0:38m29.07,with the pentameter and right creating a
,,
0:38m26.570,0:38m30.75,smoother flow right really that's what
,,
0:38m29.070,0:38m33.51,that's all and so now that you're almost
,,
0:38m30.750,0:38m35.49,at number 100 I mean like what what do
,,
0:38m33.510,0:38m37.05,you mean like do you have a different
,,
0:38m35.490,0:38m38.94,way of going about it you have a
,,
0:38m37.050,0:38m39.93,different you know the basic process is
,,
0:38m38.940,0:38m42.06,stay exactly the same
,,
0:38m39.930,0:38m43.85,I got changed the generator at one point
,,
0:38m42.060,0:38m44.22,in the process because I found it better
,,
0:38m43.859,0:38m45.66,one
,,
0:38m44.220,0:38m47.10,what were they Jen what was the first
,,
0:38m45.660,0:38m48.93,generator I don't remember what the
,,
0:38m47.100,0:38m50.73,first one was it was kind of like the
,,
0:38m48.930,0:38m52.10,standard what was like the one most
,,
0:38m50.730,0:38m54.24,people would come to first I believe
,,
0:38m52.109,0:38m55.89,okay and the way I chose it in the first
,,
0:38m54.240,0:38m58.02,place it's just one that accommodate an
,,
0:38m55.890,0:38m59.67,entire line mmm because not all of the
,,
0:38m58.020,0:39m01.41,wood okay
,,
0:38m59.670,0:39m03.60,usually there's better just like names
,,
0:39m01.410,0:39m05.47,or things like that yeah but I found one
,,
0:39m03.600,0:39m08.20,that would take an entire you know
,,
0:39m05.470,0:39m12.82,I am miss pentameter and then most
,,
0:39m08.200,0:39m19.72,recently what I use now is that I think
,,
0:39m12.820,0:39m24.09,the best of all cities is called one
,,
0:39m19.720,0:39m25.33,across that one across dot-com okay and
,,
0:39m24.099,0:39m26.80,it's nice because there's a little
,,
0:39m25.330,0:39m27.94,control after all the others are
,,
0:39m26.800,0:39m29.32,probably developed since I've been doing
,,
0:39m27.940,0:39m31.75,this too and it can do a lot of the same
,,
0:39m29.320,0:39m32.68,things but I'll put the basic line in
,,
0:39m31.750,0:39m34.27,the top box
,,
0:39m32.680,0:39m35.89,and then I have a little if I want to
,,
0:39m34.270,0:39m38.41,there's an optional box where like make
,,
0:39m35.890,0:39m39.76,sure it contains a certain word so if I
,,
0:39m38.410,0:39m41.29,find a certain word I want to make sure
,,
0:39m39.760,0:39m43.00,is in it I don't like the first view
,,
0:39m41.290,0:39m45.45,because there are like sometimes
,,
0:39m43.000,0:39m47.34,hundreds yeah just scroll through
,,
0:39m45.450,0:39m49.30,something that I'll make sure it
,,
0:39m47.349,0:39m51.46,contains slando or you know or whatever
,,
0:39m49.300,0:39m53.20,so you can limit it by that sense so
,,
0:39m51.460,0:39m55.10,yeah search and then limit the search in
,,
0:39m53.200,0:39m58.24,some way maybe not it's interesting um
,,
0:39m55.109,0:40m00.43,and don't you ever does it ever produce
,,
0:39m58.240,0:40m03.07,a perfectly I immigrant ammeter line
,,
0:40m00.430,0:40m04.48,that you can use I haven't done that
,,
0:40m03.070,0:40m05.82,yeah I'm sure it's theoretically
,,
0:40m04.480,0:40m09.54,possible
,,
0:40m05.820,0:40m11.65,so the Donati are looking there a of it
,,
0:40m09.540,0:40m13.83,we actually hope I mean you know about
,,
0:40m11.650,0:40m17.17,the pentameter on it which is this
,,
0:40m13.839,0:40m19.42,wonderful Twitter based web website no I
,,
0:40m17.170,0:40m20.77,do not know about the it is it is
,,
0:40m19.420,0:40m24.75,exactly kind of what you just said it's
,,
0:40m20.770,0:40m27.16,a somebody built a program that just
,,
0:40m24.750,0:40m28.59,continually scans Twitter ever blank
,,
0:40m27.160,0:40m32.20,everybody's Twitter account a barrel
,,
0:40m28.599,0:40m34.21,okay and finds all lines of iambic
,,
0:40m32.200,0:40m36.73,pentameter I mean most of them I'm sure
,,
0:40m34.210,0:40m38.17,accidental yeah and just and finds other
,,
0:40m36.730,0:40m40.30,lines that I am the diameter that rhyme
,,
0:40m38.170,0:40m43.81,with them and it creates this ongoing
,,
0:40m40.300,0:40m44.10,poem so I would just I can go to it
,,
0:40m43.810,0:40m46.50,right now
,,
0:40m44.109,0:40m46.50,yeah
,,
0:40m54.410,0:40m59.00,and the one thing about it is it always
,,
0:40m56.510,0:41m01.52,starts with the oldest part I wish it
,,
0:40m59.000,0:41m09.65,were bottom to top so you can always see
,,
0:41m01.520,0:41m10.94,the most recent yeah oh here we are you
,,
0:41m09.650,0:41m13.13,just go to the Twitter page for that
,,
0:41m10.940,0:41m16.07,these red cards and sweaty bodies
,,
0:41m13.130,0:41m18.62,everywhere the largest arms erect into
,,
0:41m16.070,0:41m21.11,the air I'm Way excited for the album
,,
0:41m18.620,0:41m23.90,though you just a ho a stupid stupid
,,
0:41m21.110,0:41m27.38,hook Tim Duncan is a fucking dinosaur
,,
0:41m23.900,0:41m29.54,I'm not a people person anymore I want
,,
0:41m27.380,0:41m33.56,to wear a maxi dress today I really want
,,

,,
0:41m33.560,0:41m39.08,also the original tweeter was and those
,,
0:41m36.350,0:41m42.38,random people and looks like the
,,
0:41m39.080,0:41m45.14,greatest phone of the 21st century yeah
,,
0:41m42.380,0:41m47.99,do you know who's behind it oh I don't
,,
0:41m45.140,0:41m49.19,know whoever it is I don't know them
,,
0:41m47.990,0:41m53.96,personally not remember what their name
,,
0:41m49.190,0:41m55.10,is yeah especially me I know that the
,,
0:41m53.960,0:41m57.62,New York Times have that longer I'll
,,
0:41m55.100,0:41m59.48,pull the Haiku scrum and like make
,,
0:41m57.620,0:42m04.73,little haikus meetings in one project
,,
0:41m59.480,0:42m07.19,medicines that's good so getting back to
,,
0:42m04.730,0:42m09.05,I mean do other people play any roles
,,
0:42m07.190,0:42m11.45,and all these things I mean I mean well
,,
0:42m09.050,0:42m13.91,I know I guess I'm interested in one
,,
0:42m11.450,0:42m16.70,like how it was writing to the listserv
,,
0:42m13.910,0:42m18.70,in overlying stages I mean like so in
,,
0:42m16.700,0:42m21.98,terms of revision and kind of like
,,
0:42m18.700,0:42m23.81,forces that sort of morphed into your
,,
0:42m21.980,0:42m25.19,poetry I mean like what was that like it
,,
0:42m23.810,0:42m27.20,all looks great I mean there was really
,,
0:42m25.190,0:42m28.34,I think most members of the of the list
,,
0:42m27.200,0:42m30.95,would agree that was the most
,,
0:42m28.340,0:42m32.48,stimulating yeah think about being on
,,
0:42m30.950,0:42m35.63,the list was just feeding off everyone
,,
0:42m32.480,0:42m37.43,else's excitement and creativity yeah
,,
0:42m35.630,0:42m39.35,because it was a very much a big hug
,,
0:42m37.430,0:42m41.93,fist right it was not almost nothing
,,
0:42m39.350,0:42m43.82,critical going on there ever we just try
,,
0:42m41.930,0:42m46.70,to like write stuff up bust each other
,,
0:42m43.820,0:42m48.77,up and it would be very responsive if
,,
0:42m46.700,0:42m50.45,somebody wrote a you know phone with
,,
0:42m48.770,0:42m52.37,farting unicorns somebody else would
,,
0:42m50.450,0:42m55.28,write one okay i spanned that like
,,
0:42m52.370,0:42m58.34,farting glittery unicorns you know and
,,
0:42m55.280,0:43m00.71,the sillier the better the more
,,
0:42m58.340,0:43m02.24,obnoxious the better because that was
,,
0:43m00.710,0:43m04.01,that was a sort of privileged stuff on
,,
0:43m02.240,0:43m06.59,with the farting unicorns i mean that
,,
0:43m04.010,0:43m07.91,sort of like silliness was was very
,,
0:43m06.590,0:43m10.00,highly valued on the list
,,
0:43m07.910,0:43m12.03,yeah I mean that was that those kind of
,,
0:43m10.009,0:43m14.32,original spirit of flowers which again
,,
0:43m12.039,0:43m16.25,and I think it's also a part of the
,,
0:43m14.329,0:43m19.18,reason a lot of the for a lot of the
,,
0:43m16.250,0:43m21.79,resistance to flower from experimental
,,
0:43m19.180,0:43m24.58,directions yeah there's a sense of which
,,
0:43m21.799,0:43m27.10,it wasn't taking the struggle seriously
,,
0:43m24.589,0:43m29.77,enough or something mm-hmm which you
,,
0:43m27.109,0:43m32.50,know I think comes out of this for me
,,
0:43m29.779,0:43m35.15,misguided sense that absolutes dumb-face
,,
0:43m32.509,0:43m38.56,Ignis is necessary at all times
,,
0:43m35.150,0:43m40.13,yeah and there are times when I think
,,
0:43m38.569,0:43m41.66,there are legitimate objections I'd
,,
0:43m40.130,0:43m44.56,rather not go into the details that
,,
0:43m41.660,0:43m46.91,there are you know some poems that upset
,,
0:43m44.569,0:43m48.74,people right and I think it was very
,,
0:43m46.910,0:43m51.89,upsetting to the people who wrote them
,,
0:43m48.740,0:43m53.93,that they did upset people because yeah
,,
0:43m51.890,0:43m55.27,even though it might seem to me I was
,,
0:43m53.930,0:43m57.07,like what what are you trying to offend
,,
0:43m55.279,0:44m00.89,people what are you trying to get people
,,
0:43m57.079,0:44m04.81,except like well no not you know not
,,
0:44m00.890,0:44m06.65,these beautiful afraid yeah and and I
,,
0:44m04.819,0:44m09.68,think initially we were very resentful
,,
0:44m06.650,0:44m11.63,about it it's all your you know we're on
,,
0:44m09.680,0:44m15.07,your side you're misunderstanding us and
,,
0:44m11.630,0:44m19.24,you know these are not whatever racist
,,
0:44m15.079,0:44m21.88,or sexist or otherwise you know vile
,,
0:44m19.240,0:44m27.01,intentions that you're looking at here
,,
0:44m21.880,0:44m30.79,but I mean I feel like as a as as time
,,
0:44m27.019,0:44m32.56,has gone on I mean I I try I try very
,,
0:44m30.799,0:44m35.90,hard to be more sympathetic to that
,,
0:44m32.569,0:44m37.54,response because out of that context ya
,,
0:44m35.900,0:44m41.15,know that the diverse from it's easy to
,,
0:44m37.549,0:44m44.00,see how a poem that mentions certain
,,
0:44m41.150,0:44m46.02,things in certain tones right is it
,,
0:44m44.000,0:44m47.96,almost impossible to separate from a
,,
0:44m46.029,0:44m50.02,problem that mentions those things of
,,
0:44m47.960,0:44m53.63,that tone with us with different
,,
0:44m50.029,0:44m54.89,intentions yeah I think out even past
,,
0:44m53.630,0:44m56.75,four five I think things like that are
,,
0:44m54.890,0:45m01.09,going on right now with some of the
,,
0:44m56.750,0:45m03.07,younger conceptual writers and yeah one
,,
0:45m01.099,0:45m07.00,does work I really admire an I see other
,,
0:45m03.079,0:45m08.59,poets I really admire deeply hurt you
,,
0:45m07.009,0:45m11.42,know button work they're creating it's
,,
0:45m08.599,0:45m14.63,very difficult I don't have a way to
,,
0:45m11.420,0:45m17.39,kind of like justify any of it or put it
,,
0:45m14.630,0:45m21.53,into order in my mind no it's a tough
,,
0:45m17.390,0:45m23.57,one with that I mean so what is
,,
0:45m21.530,0:45m25.76,what do you think how do you think I
,,
0:45m23.570,0:45m27.32,mean it means a lot of your career a lot
,,
0:45m25.760,0:45m29.24,of your writing heads that kind of
,,
0:45m27.320,0:45m30.62,happened on from the internet and on the
,,
0:45m29.240,0:45m33.11,internet with the blogging and those in
,,
0:45m30.620,0:45m35.39,the commenting and that and that seems
,,
0:45m33.110,0:45m37.40,to have in some ways died down pretty
,,
0:45m35.390,0:45m40.43,and you know what our games seems to be
,,
0:45m37.400,0:45m42.95,the thing of the best yeah yeah and I
,,
0:45m40.430,0:45m44.57,mean like what how did that shape your
,,
0:45m42.950,0:45m46.40,sort of your practice your writing I
,,
0:45m44.570,0:45m48.62,mean you say that you've you've evolved
,,
0:45m46.400,0:45m50.90,in some in some ways about your opinions
,,
0:45m48.620,0:45m52.28,on some of the some of the content that
,,
0:45m50.900,0:45m54.29,would be included
,,
0:45m52.280,0:45m56.99,has there been in other effects or could
,,
0:45m54.290,0:45m58.25,you elaborate more on that I'd say what
,,
0:45m56.990,0:46m00.80,I've evolved it first of all what I've
,,
0:45m58.250,0:46m03.44,evolved and is not necessarily I haven't
,,
0:46m00.800,0:46m05.45,changed my mind about you know some of
,,
0:46m03.440,0:46m09.62,them whatever you want to call it
,,
0:46m05.450,0:46m12.95,starting theory I've just become I've
,,
0:46m09.620,0:46m15.08,tried to become more empathetic you know
,,
0:46m12.950,0:46m18.35,and not immediately judge anyone who
,,
0:46m15.080,0:46m20.30,doesn't get it right or with that or
,,
0:46m18.350,0:46m23.15,even see even it using a phrase like
,,
0:46m20.300,0:46m26.54,doesn't get it already shows a residual
,,
0:46m23.150,0:46m29.24,of judgment and yeah that there may be
,,
0:46m26.540,0:46m31.04,more than one way to get it and in some
,,
0:46m29.240,0:46m32.75,ways don't match our intentions and that
,,
0:46m31.040,0:46m35.30,we need you know need to consider that
,,
0:46m32.750,0:46m37.91,we are accountable for that right so
,,
0:46m35.300,0:46m39.68,well in so much of sort of the I don't
,,
0:46m37.910,0:46m41.66,know the latter part of Clark has been
,,
0:46m39.680,0:46m43.64,that's our debt to flarf in the sense
,,
0:46m41.660,0:46m45.47,that some of the blog posts and whatnot
,,
0:46m43.640,0:46m47.36,I mean like was that partly the
,,
0:46m45.470,0:46m49.55,reactions like just let it go I mean
,,
0:46m47.360,0:46m50.99,like and so it was I mean where where
,,
0:46m49.550,0:46m52.13,does it go from there I guess the
,,
0:46m50.990,0:46m53.81,question I'm not sure how much I think
,,
0:46m52.130,0:46m55.64,death of large most of the time was a
,,
0:46m53.810,0:46m57.89,phrase we used ourselves just kind of
,,
0:46m55.640,0:47m00.97,like oh yeah trying to kill the Beast
,,
0:46m57.890,0:47m03.11,below the red held us or something but a
,,
0:47m00.970,0:47m06.05,rapidly they just ran its course I think
,,
0:47m03.110,0:47m08.57,like any movement right you know the
,,
0:47m06.050,0:47m10.88,movement itself had its main value is in
,,
0:47m08.570,0:47m13.58,the way it motivated the members of the
,,
0:47m10.880,0:47m15.68,movement and most of the writers have
,,
0:47m13.580,0:47m17.51,gone to write however they're going to
,,
0:47m15.680,0:47m19.70,write yeah and it's influenced by that
,,
0:47m17.510,0:47m20.90,that's not the same right so I mean your
,,
0:47m19.700,0:47m24.53,original question I guess was about the
,,
0:47m20.900,0:47m27.65,blogging yeah kind of how that
,,
0:47m24.530,0:47m29.06,influenced here your own writing I don't
,,
0:47m27.650,0:47m30.26,know I think for me again the main value
,,
0:47m29.060,0:47m30.63,of the blogging thing was bringing me
,,
0:47m30.260,0:47m32.16,into
,,
0:47m30.630,0:47m34.85,contact with other with other pellets
,,
0:47m32.160,0:47m36.50,yeah at having discussions I think there
,,
0:47m34.859,0:47m39.39,were a lot of people in the early aughts
,,
0:47m36.509,0:47m41.75,especially blogging everyday and we're
,,
0:47m39.390,0:47m44.36,having fun conversations for whatever
,,
0:47m41.759,0:47m48.59,reason you moved on to their platforms
,,
0:47m44.369,0:47m50.51,and yeah the project it also has course
,,
0:47m48.599,0:47m53.78,it doesn't I don't know I mean I think
,,
0:47m50.519,0:47m58.61,the main effect was just just social
,,
0:47m53.789,0:48m00.56,okay um it didn't it would mean like so
,,
0:47m58.619,0:48m02.09,I guess one question is could you have
,,
0:48m00.569,0:48m03.69,written in the sonograms in the way that
,,
0:48m02.099,0:48m06.24,you're doing without far I mean like
,,
0:48m03.690,0:48m07.58,what sort of it moves from there well I
,,
0:48m06.240,0:48m09.39,mean there there are certain service
,,
0:48m07.589,0:48m12.15,similarities right and that I give the
,,
0:48m09.390,0:48m13.85,refrigerator magnet process yeah pasting
,,
0:48m12.150,0:48m16.58,something into whirring using that as my
,,
0:48m13.859,0:48m17.94,template so yeah I think it works I mean
,,
0:48m16.589,0:48m19.68,suddenly it's at least a real I
,,
0:48m17.940,0:48m23.94,considered it an extension of life
,,
0:48m19.680,0:48m25.25,practice yeah I mean I guess there's no
,,
0:48m23.940,0:48m27.15,way to say it is or isn't there's goes
,,
0:48m25.259,0:48m29.70,to essence meaning to that it is if I
,,
0:48m27.150,0:48m32.03,say it is right yeah I mean I think it
,,
0:48m29.700,0:48m33.39,definitely it's probably something I
,,
0:48m32.039,0:48m34.98,wouldn't have done it quite the same way
,,
0:48m33.390,0:48m37.31,I did it if I hadn't been doing flow
,,
0:48m34.980,0:48m38.67,what what I mean it goes back to some of
,,
0:48m37.319,0:48m40.52,the questioners talking about what it
,,
0:48m38.670,0:48m42.21,sort of skills did you learn in doing
,,
0:48m40.529,0:48m43.76,the flowers that kind of go into the
,,
0:48m42.210,0:48m45.39,sonograms I mean what you come in like
,,
0:48m43.769,0:48m47.94,feeling strong about and then what did
,,
0:48m45.390,0:48m49.28,you learn with without I think it's what
,,
0:48m47.940,0:48m51.00,I mentioned earlier just that the
,,
0:48m49.289,0:48m54.80,approach to arrangement okay
,,
0:48m51.000,0:48m57.63,finding clusters finding strings yeah it
,,
0:48m54.809,0:49m00.72,already existing groups of you know
,,
0:48m57.630,0:49m03.66,verbal rural groups beneath that kind of
,,
0:49m00.720,0:49m05.09,being able to sift and sculpt yeah I
,,
0:49m03.660,0:49m08.49,think it was already in front of me yeah
,,
0:49m05.099,0:49m11.75,um and then so I mean I think we've kind
,,
0:49m08.490,0:49m12.66,of covered some of the general push
,,
0:49m11.759,0:49m14.70,through
,,
0:49m12.660,0:49m16.61,composition and revision but I'm also
,,
0:49m14.700,0:49m19.68,interested in how you would put together
,,
0:49m16.619,0:49m20.94,the books especially well one question
,,
0:49m19.680,0:49m23.73,before we move on to that do you still
,,
0:49m20.940,0:49m25.58,write in that sort of traditional source
,,
0:49m23.730,0:49m27.26,way I mean are you still grabbing
,,
0:49m25.589,0:49m29.70,Google's responses and we haven't done a
,,
0:49m27.269,0:49m35.25,long time I think that I did a few kind
,,
0:49m29.700,0:49m36.50,of like post flarf flarf books okay for
,,
0:49m35.250,0:49m38.93,a couple years after I started doing
,,
0:49m36.509,0:49m41.22,this on it goes but eventually it just I
,,
0:49m38.930,0:49m42.98,don't know I think I think even the way
,,
0:49m41.220,0:49m45.80,it's like configured on the Internet
,,
0:49m42.980,0:49m47.81,as such that it doesn't work quite in
,,
0:49m45.800,0:49m49.85,the same way I could yeah exactly al but
,,
0:49m47.810,0:49m51.44,I'm in the one or two times in the last
,,
0:49m49.850,0:49m54.08,year took even thought about trying to
,,
0:49m51.440,0:49m55.43,go back and do it this isn't the same so
,,
0:49m54.080,0:49m57.26,a lot more information like underneath
,,
0:49m55.430,0:49m59.09,and on the side and I mean it's just
,,
0:49m57.260,0:50m00.59,kind of a as other and so yeah I think
,,
0:49m59.090,0:50m03.05,part of those good lows gotten too smart
,,
0:50m00.590,0:50m05.32,ya know things are grouped according to
,,
0:50m03.050,0:50m08.09,usefulness rather than just random
,,
0:50m05.320,0:50m10.94,occurrence of words and who you are to
,,
0:50m08.090,0:50m13.85,which is yet so it knows me too well at
,,
0:50m10.940,0:50m17.86,I don't trust it people let it appear
,,
0:50m13.850,0:50m20.72,and disappear for terrifying so anybody
,,
0:50m17.869,0:50m22.34,in those terms like what were you using
,,
0:50m20.720,0:50m23.66,like how are you composing the books
,,
0:50m22.340,0:50m26.35,then I guess the question might be a
,,
0:50m23.660,0:50m29.42,grad nation and a breathalyser in the
,,
0:50m26.359,0:50m30.77,front I mean like word were you do you
,,
0:50m29.420,0:50m32.24,have second you know how many sections
,,
0:50m30.770,0:50m33.89,in those books they're kind of be kind
,,
0:50m32.240,0:50m35.45,of a through right really the only one
,,
0:50m33.890,0:50m37.36,that's to matically in any sense
,,
0:50m35.450,0:50m39.14,organize is the first one okay I mean
,,
0:50m37.369,0:50m42.68,with the whole deer head team yeah as I
,,
0:50m39.140,0:50m44.06,sort of floating metaphor great for the
,,
0:50m42.680,0:50m45.41,next I mean breathalyzer in the front
,,
0:50m44.060,0:50m47.78,and honest I've seen a pretty much
,,
0:50m45.410,0:50m49.49,interchangeable in terms of how the
,,
0:50m47.780,0:50m54.08,poems are chosen and grouped they're
,,
0:50m49.490,0:50m55.79,they're just individual poems and I
,,
0:50m54.080,0:50m58.25,actually have a full other manuscript
,,
0:50m55.790,0:51m00.38,that then that may or may not get
,,
0:50m58.250,0:51m02.09,published from that period okay it's
,,
0:51m00.380,0:51m03.71,just been so long now that even though I
,,
0:51m02.090,0:51m06.02,actually like a lot of the phones in it
,,
0:51m03.710,0:51m07.70,does anybody really want this now is it
,,
0:51m06.020,0:51m11.41,it's the time past
,,
0:51m07.700,0:51m13.60,yeah it's called monsters and
,,
0:51m11.410,0:51m15.71,tentatively it might come out from its
,,
0:51m13.609,0:51m17.96,books but I haven't followed up on my
,,
0:51m15.710,0:51m19.43,obligations of getting the names compel
,,
0:51m17.960,0:51m22.25,that so I don't know where I stand with
,,
0:51m19.430,0:51m23.57,that I may have screwed it up did you I
,,
0:51m22.250,0:51m25.16,mean when you were publishing these
,,
0:51m23.570,0:51m26.84,books in maybe with monsters do you have
,,
0:51m25.160,0:51m28.58,relationships with the editors and
,,
0:51m26.840,0:51m30.80,they're like reviving the shape of the
,,
0:51m28.580,0:51m32.39,book I'll definitely have a relationship
,,
0:51m30.800,0:51m35.23,of the editors I'm like Rod Smith for a
,,
0:51m32.390,0:51m38.39,great fantastic editor fantastic poet
,,
0:51m35.230,0:51m40.82,these pretty hands-off in terms of the
,,
0:51m38.390,0:51m44.75,actual creative content took us maybe in
,,
0:51m40.820,0:51m46.94,turn may be the oh he's good I'd say his
,,
0:51m44.750,0:51m49.91,input and his helpers input comes with a
,,
0:51m46.940,0:51m51.77,level things like layout yeah okay and
,,
0:51m49.910,0:51m52.49,then so I mean I know you also have
,,
0:51m51.770,0:51m54.83,someone like
,,
0:51m52.490,0:51m57.34,like me chat books and whatnot where
,,
0:51m54.830,0:51m59.90,where do those I mean what do you feel
,,
0:51m57.349,0:52m00.68,about those and like how do you end up
,,
0:51m59.900,0:52m02.71,with them
,,
0:52m00.680,0:52m05.63,I don't even looked at them so long as I
,,
0:52m02.710,0:52m09.60,get clear answers like I remember that
,,
0:52m05.630,0:52m12.41,some of its very early flowers yeah yeah
,,
0:52m09.609,0:52m14.75,yeah and I get I haven't looked at a
,,
0:52m12.410,0:52m16.31,long time I suspect I think I probably
,,
0:52m14.750,0:52m18.34,just cringed looking at a lot of it
,,
0:52m16.310,0:52m19.88,because I think it's that because I
,,
0:52m18.349,0:52m21.98,think what was in Italy exciting about
,,
0:52m19.880,0:52m23.51,the process is what quickly becomes
,,
0:52m21.980,0:52m25.52,predictable and crude about it
,,
0:52m23.510,0:52m27.89,uh-huh like oh look if the text comes
,,
0:52m25.520,0:52m28.58,off the internet and it's here it smells
,,
0:52m27.890,0:52m29.99,like the UNITA
,,
0:52m28.580,0:52m32.63,okay because the internet all over it
,,
0:52m29.990,0:52m36.71,yes and becomes kind of obvious after a
,,
0:52m32.630,0:52m40.46,while yeah but I don't know what's the
,,
0:52m36.710,0:52m43.73,most recent one like that yeah I mean
,,
0:52m40.460,0:52m46.01,that's all so long ago that I and in
,,
0:52m43.730,0:52m47.63,terms of like that the the digital
,,
0:52m46.010,0:52m49.55,documents that contain those manuscripts
,,
0:52m47.630,0:52m50.99,in those books I mean are they in a
,,
0:52m49.550,0:52m53.24,certain spot in your computer somewhere
,,
0:52m50.990,0:52m55.01,they do you have them I think I just
,,
0:52m53.240,0:52m56.48,have the original Word document so the
,,
0:52m55.010,0:52m58.70,original word about whatever else is out
,,
0:52m56.480,0:53m01.64,there or maybe a PDF and supplications
,,
0:52m58.700,0:53m03.05,do you feel any way and it's getting
,,
0:53m01.640,0:53m05.06,back to one of the technical stuff the
,,
0:53m03.050,0:53m06.68,feeling we're certainly geared towards
,,
0:53m05.060,0:53m08.21,them I mean do you have like kind of or
,,
0:53m06.680,0:53m10.49,you just like these are there it really
,,
0:53m08.210,0:53m11.99,is the books the book and that's sort of
,,
0:53m10.490,0:53m14.42,a leading question but I guess I'm
,,
0:53m11.990,0:53m16.36,wondering like take a pee-pee are you
,,
0:53m14.420,0:53m17.59,are you really taking care to like those
,,
0:53m16.369,0:53m18.77,there enough value on them that you're
,,
0:53m17.599,0:53m20.33,taking they make sure you know where
,,
0:53m18.770,0:53m21.80,they are and they're valued and that are
,,
0:53m20.330,0:53m23.11,on the digital well there's a message
,,
0:53m21.800,0:53m25.49,that much value that I know I have
,,
0:53m23.119,0:53m27.77,copies of them yeah but beyond that I
,,
0:53m25.490,0:53m30.08,mean and again it's not I'm not trying
,,
0:53m27.770,0:53m32.27,to be evasive it's not that actually I'm
,,
0:53m30.080,0:53m34.40,embarrassed or have strong feelings one
,,
0:53m32.270,0:53m36.32,way or the other is it I really don't
,,
0:53m34.400,0:53m39.41,remember that well what's in them okay
,,
0:53m36.320,0:53m41.30,yeah isn't it because it was just doing
,,
0:53m39.410,0:53m42.80,so much stuff at that time right I mean
,,
0:53m41.300,0:53m44.30,I'm sure if I took a few minutes ago oh
,,
0:53m42.800,0:53m46.76,yeah this one this is could I like this
,,
0:53m44.300,0:53m48.77,one er I don't like that one so much but
,,
0:53m46.760,0:53m58.45,yeah I'm trying to even form a mental
,,
0:53m48.770,0:53m58.45,image now but yeah um
,,
0:53m59.119,0:54m05.97,so you have a few questions that I
,,
0:54m03.540,0:54m14.25,wanted to make sure you asked but I
,,
0:54m05.970,0:54m17.28,think I got through most of them I mean
,,
0:54m14.250,0:54m21.51,it's sort of like - I mean how does this
,,
0:54m17.280,0:54m22.77,men influence Lee I mean I want
,,
0:54m21.510,0:54m24.18,questions I asked these you know the
,,
0:54m22.770,0:54m25.32,other people who teach and you teach - I
,,
0:54m24.180,0:54m27.75,mean how does this influence the way you
,,
0:54m25.320,0:54m29.76,teach I mean like what sort of what did
,,
0:54m27.750,0:54m32.10,Clark teach you that then you try to
,,
0:54m29.760,0:54m34.53,teach them or anything in that sense I
,,
0:54m32.100,0:54m38.43,mean I guess the single most important
,,
0:54m34.530,0:54m43.05,thing is just that it has to be fun
,,
0:54m38.430,0:54m45.09,on some level yeah no not - I think it's
,,
0:54m43.050,0:54m47.07,very I wouldn't just certainly frame it
,,
0:54m45.090,0:54m48.51,as flarf in the classroom in this way
,,
0:54m47.070,0:54m49.92,but I think one of the first things I
,,
0:54m48.510,0:54m52.92,try to do at the beginning classroom is
,,
0:54m49.920,0:54m54.63,break down a sense of over seriousness I
,,
0:54m52.920,0:54m56.31,think it unfolds people back so I'll
,,
0:54m54.630,0:54m57.75,give them exercises which people were
,,
0:54m56.310,0:54m59.76,doing along before flock you know write
,,
0:54m57.750,0:55m02.85,the worst poem you can yeah things like
,,
0:54m59.760,0:55m05.22,that or all my or a night for a specific
,,
0:55m02.850,0:55m07.59,exercise suggest a procedure that is
,,
0:55m05.220,0:55m08.76,relevant to flower but I won't say okay
,,
0:55m07.590,0:55m11.73,now we're going to write off large poem
,,
0:55m08.760,0:55m13.23,great I try to there are inevitably
,,
0:55m11.730,0:55m15.27,times when it comes up or somebody in
,,
0:55m13.230,0:55m17.76,the classes were to flower right say hey
,,
0:55m15.270,0:55m20.25,what's flowers and the story will get
,,
0:55m17.760,0:55m21.84,told yeah but I actually try to hold
,,
0:55m20.250,0:55m25.85,back on that because too often it
,,
0:55m21.840,0:55m27.99,results I think in exercises it might be
,,
0:55m25.859,0:55m30.96,fun for the student and even produce you
,,
0:55m27.990,0:55m32.88,know humorous material mm-hmm but
,,
0:55m30.960,0:55m36.93,doesn't necessarily contribute to the
,,
0:55m32.880,0:55m38.82,kinds of foundational verbal skills feel
,,
0:55m36.930,0:55m41.60,that I want people to concentrate or if
,,
0:55m38.820,0:55m43.34,it does it doesn't for everyone easy for
,,
0:55m41.609,0:55m46.14,some people it can be a way to avoid it
,,
0:55m43.340,0:55m48.00,right I guess that's true of everything
,,
0:55m46.140,0:55m49.89,but and what are the sort of
,,
0:55m48.000,0:55m50.28,foundational verbal skills the year
,,
0:55m49.890,0:55m52.47,after
,,
0:55m50.280,0:55m56.60,I'm just really basic conservative
,,
0:55m52.470,0:55m58.77,things like rhythm like avoiding cliches
,,
0:55m56.609,0:56m04.04,like yeah you know I'm just writing
,,
0:55m58.770,0:56m06.99,something that where you're where you're
,,
0:56m04.040,0:56m09.96,well you're not just recycling receive
,,
0:56m06.990,0:56m11.29,notions of what ought to be great yeah
,,
0:56m09.960,0:56m12.82,yeah
,,
0:56m11.299,0:56m14.05,we saw kind of getting towards writing
,,
0:56m12.829,0:56m16.81,something interesting making something
,,
0:56m14.059,0:56m18.22,interesting to read in someone and
,,
0:56m16.819,0:56m20.56,looking into sources you might not
,,
0:56m18.229,0:56m23.39,immediately consider encouraging them to
,,
0:56m20.569,0:56m26.46,read a lot of poetry yeah really basic
,,
0:56m23.390,0:56m26.46,thing great great
,,
0:56m33.819,0:56m42.46,just a few more questions
,,
0:56m35.539,0:56m43.57,uh I guess yeah no good oh good that was
,,
0:56m42.469,0:56m46.93,really great a pleasure
