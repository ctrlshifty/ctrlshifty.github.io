original,line
1,1012 poems sort of goes together you can
2,2 or 50 pages there's there's a kind of
3,20th century and I taught Hart Crane
4,3/3 load and then ultimately Kim and I
5,3:00 if I can stop by could we look at
6,9:00 I almost always have a night class
7,97 I can't remember now so it's still a
8,a big deal who knows yeah seems to be
9,a Buick
10,a couple of other interviews with
11,a final version of that poem called ant
12,a half three hour discussion about this
13,a higher-resolution thing
14,a hour and a half recording reading 12
15,a kind of theme I don't but I'm not
16,a little bit I don't think there's
17,a little screen is black and white
18,a lot of organization it's just where I
19,a myth and a shame only came out once
20,a not so special piece of technology
21,a phrase and that was that was a great
22,a scholar somebody who's willing to
23,a typewriter
24,a typewriter because it might have given
25,a way I suppose the best thing I could
26,a way the third the last poem in the
27,a which I still have still works a
28,a writer I wanted to write novel so I
29,a year or two before I begin to have
30,abbreviated little snippets which are
31,about 2008 maybe and I started out just
32,about a third it would just feel a lot
33,about it and I can't really blame him
34,about it and then I also print things
35,about it differently that's just how I
36,about it you like oh right that's what
37,about palms I resent him a couple of
38,about routine and schedule suppose
39,about that many poems that have already
40,about the internet I thought I hear what
41,about them that way except for the fact
42,about what she said with my two or three
43,about which version is which and the
44,about writing a poem how did you kind of
45,about you've written like 70 look let's
46,absolutely I mean it doesn't it never
47,absolutely I told Phil mean about he
48,absolutely the way I
49,abstract but nevertheless certain sense
50,accepted so I got like hooked on that
51,access to you but there's also surgery
52,account that I just kind of keep private
53,accumulative thing in some ways I mean
54,ACK so he had to read poems from from
55,across you well it look it will keep
56,active I think it's gone anyway I can't
57,actually talks about these things they
58,actually yeah that's so that's my
59,address its Boise oh it's that asshole
60,addresses I get a lot of writerly emails
61,advent of any other kind of technology
62,aesthetically is a completely other kind
63,after drawing a line about what the
64,again and kind of where you got to say
65,again I guess you're talking about the
66,again then let's see went to Norwich and
67,again within the first three or four
68,Air and I no longer have an external
69,all about this stuff at the that's a
70,all bra which looks like Alda bird but
71,all my all my Word files and I've still
72,all of them positive nobody know they're
73,all over the place because that's what I
74,all the excitement happens that the
75,all the poems I think might comprise the
76,all these books of mine are going to be
77,all those all those communications from
78,allows you to see those possibilities
79,almost all letters okay but I don't you
80,almost as the typewriter is and then how
81,almost entirely unrelated so that kind
82,along a longer thing when I'll get
83,also gets complicated - you have this
84,although it was written while I was
85,although sometimes I change title so I
86,always believed that writing begets
87,always ready to pencil and and I'll go
88,American fear what is there when you're
89,American Lit class English 570 so
90,an Aston Martin and live in the South of
91,anatomy of melancholy and other poems
92,anatomy of melancholy five five books
93,anatomy of melancholy I thought I had
94,and a couple of other people just to
95,and after a while I'll just dump those
96,and and got real keen on poetry and
97,and and I've got a bunch of those that
98,and and so we have a great deal of fun
99,and and sometimes make discoveries you
100,and and the president of Viking came up
101,and as serious as a say a 21 year old
102,and conversely has it what sort of
103,and eliminate the others or print them
104,and finding say located this batch of
105,and for some people they get tangled up
106,and forth and so I'm trying to track
107,and forth more with the typewriter are
108,and going to ebooks much and if it does
109,and he was there and I gave this reading
110,and how you did it in so it's going to
111,and I can do that with I can get
112,and I can start writing down lines and
113,and I guess I'm wondering he could sort
114,and I guess we'll talk about teaching
115,and I just thought to myself and they
116,and I looked at it on the page on the
117,and I'll come home and I immediately
118,and I'll go back in and think I want to
119,and I'm not producing this anymore
120,and it can open up it can open up in so
121,and it changed everything about the poem
122,and it's awesome not always but it is
123,and it's easy enough to look at them
124,and just crush my laptop I managed to
125,and kuba ganas poet Blackfeet Indian
126,and looked into graduate school and
127,and most of those they rallied prints
128,and my own marginalia on my own poems
129,and not have to type it completely in or
130,and pull a book off the shelves almost
131,and put them in order in the order in
132,and realizing and a lot of it had to do
133,and said do you have a book I said why I
134,and say well suppose could be called
135,and see how they and read them that it
136,and so I can I can not pay attention to
137,and so I think beginning system is you
138,and so I wrote this you know it's five
139,and so then you've been we've been out
140,and so you're sort of talking about this
141,and somehow converting the handwritten
142,and start making and I have a system of
143,and that just you know more and more or
144,and that sort of that's your like online
145,and that was when I moved from actually
146,and that's a very serious distinction
147,and that's so that's what I that's what
148,and that's that and that that's pretty
149,and that's when I decided to sort of
150,and that's where I usually smoke my
151,and the boxes eat your scholars the
152,and the the process of revision is
153,and then a kind of Shakespearean couplet
154,and then I started tenure track on a job
155,and then wait and see what would happen
156,and then your other folder they're what
157,and they didn't have to who am I to talk
158,and this probably would have been let's
159,and twenty some odd lines it was eight
160,and we were both in England with Dennis
161,and we'll have a you know a good two and
162,and what if there's a bit of phrasing on
163,and write it back down longhand in the
164,and you have been six years of them over
165,and you're they say that means who's
166,anise I can add two or three links the
167,another check so they're a couple spots
168,another one of those manuscript boxes
169,ant one and two and three because I'm
170,any different than any other than the
171,any hang I've published before so and I
172,any money off me anyway okay all right
173,any vault yeah let me try guys just a
174,anybody else to look at who was not Kim
175,anymore
176,anymore because I'm not you know I
177,anymore it's out here somewhere
178,anything but my editor said Donna you
179,anything else that existed along the way
180,anything particularly holy about the
181,anything that changed when you move from
182,anyway so I I can do that I can get
183,anywhere along the way which was
184,appeal to me and I'll open up open it up
185,appeared as kind of a little preparatory
186,appears though a reverse and not prose
187,arc it's it's boy it's a very pale arc
188,archival if that doesn't make sense with
189,archiving I never have and probably I
190,arduous thing and and it might not have
191,are all these are all Dan there's a
192,are bird calls them thesis binders so
193,are still in progress have you ever
194,are you fucks with organizing that media
195,around this is what the title is I'd
196,around with a musical phrase to see
197,as a book stop and I didn't used to have
198,as a gradual change or not change orders
199,as a piece of technology so I used it as
200,as as in say anatomy of melancholy a
201,as in Jesus you have somebody and
202,as it stands there and I'll eliminate
203,as many possible readings if you will as
204,as music and and mostly all my files and
205,as people I know who send me terrific
206,as sections throughout the book actually
207,as writer's block if you call a plumber
208,as you know publication is not the same
209,assemble another file consisting of
210,assuming so New Yorker with all that
211,at a time that's on a page that love but
212,at all I had to put a pencil debate or a
213,at least in those those two books of
214,at Montana when I was in graduate school
215,at random I mean sometimes I have no
216,at the beginning of trying to write
217,at the end or at least a kind of cup
218,at which there were the president of
219,attachment with a couple of poems and
220,auntie I told her about my and we wound
221,back but this is going to be kind of
222,back here that in fact need to be moved
223,back in here and find like four five
224,back stuff up on mozi just to just to
225,back they still like the idea of letters
226,back through here and you end and go
227,back to college and within a matter of a
228,back up every hour it would just back up
229,backspace here space here yeah return
230,backup is that pretty much what worried
231,ballin in typewriter typing in page
232,basically the pile which is not very
233,basically to ten questions are coming
234,be about something sure they're about
235,be afflicted by some bug yeah and and
236,be fine yeah but I do think that it's
237,be kind of the next thing and then the
238,be Tuesday and Thursday so I teach
239,be working I'm not going to like present
240,beards and Cornelius Eady and nobody
241,became part of it did it change your
242,became part of your life that you get
243,because I it's so it's just a way of
244,because I was continually picking
245,because I wrote him and I've got a file
246,because looking at it on this on the
247,because of that but and then everybody
248,because sometimes it will be I know it's
249,because that's that's the place where
250,because that's what that's really what
251,because there's not a date on them
252,because there's that's a recipe for
253,because they can do that and it's a
254,because they filled up really fast it's
255,because they're really it is a
256,becomes also the part of the revision of
257,been here for a long time so when this
258,been here in a long time but could be
259,been it really has been and it was that
260,been published and maybe a few more in
261,been using for the last well 20 years I
262,before I went to sleep but then yeah we
263,before them you know when it had to be
264,began haunting the library of my alma
265,began this is my submission notebook
266,began using computers on a regular basis
267,began when I started converting to the
268,being CFL opinions were sort of
269,being cluttered up yeah and make and
270,being gone for 13 days while we went to
271,beings big as it can possibly be having
272,believe you're sitting you're sort of
273,belong to James Welch the great novelist
274,better outside and out how do you mean
275,better way out of the book so I still
276,between them then I've got to go back
277,big fun - I do love sonnets I should
278,binders are called it Harvard and
279,bit more computer is absolutely those
280,bless him but we haven't we had a
281,book happens before the first poem in
282,book is in advance even before I've
283,book of poems how the book works on the
284,book that's in four sections then I have
285,books but I love the form and the form
286,books out there run along I'm interested
287,books you know
288,bookstores I buy them I'm not
289,boring questions only boring answers and
290,boring to a lot of people but I think -
291,born February 27 to 1951 we are sitting
292,both mostly I think it's positive mostly
293,bought me one of these and I and I and I
294,box out from the house and it takes me
295,boxes are hundreds of them and I got a
296,boxes oh so do you save the drafts of
297,Brandon trans yes there's no such thing
298,break this into terse is because like
299,bring some other kind of an image some
300,bring you this to the end of this
301,British poets pockets no all right well
302,British publisher so they shipped
303,bruh all she did was correspondence with
304,brutal for you
305,build on my glasses on but yeah making
306,built this building in 2002 so 11 years
307,bullets and say here's this anise anise
308,bumps I don't hate pros bones I just
309,but and all those kinds of things but I
310,but do you think do you see like this
311,but don't really know and a lot of
312,but I do that's one of the reasons why I
313,but I think I kind of used it really as
314,but if there's a point at which one's
315,but in fact it seems to me like a much
316,but it gets day it gets the it gets the
317,but she didn't really want to be with
318,but that's what it did find something
319,but then I got waylaid by poetry and and
320,but then the issue becomes for them a
321,but there are these little short
322,but they loved me and tried to
323,but this draft was composed on the
324,but yeah well it is an interesting move
325,but you know there's then there's a
326,buy them in the bookstore at Montana but
327,by the time Li they will confine me
328,by which I mean I set the margins and I
329,cable buried an Ethernet cable up so I
330,call them versions of all of the books
331,called and I got the delivery date
332,called in the bank of beautiful Sam that
333,called it will be what oh wait there's
334,called stanza one of the two Italian
335,called them then they've had a minimal
336,came to be practicing it before you were
337,can allow you to see things about its
338,can come move into sort of talking about
339,can do I can do a search I can type a
340,can have no control over that so I'm
341,can I make those things all work
342,can open it up here okay and so you
343,can use your outdoor urinal it's right
344,can you do you see any distinct stages
345,can you know can we meet tomorrow I know
346,can't get away from the students that
347,can't write lower your standards and
348,capable of finishing it I'd got onto
349,career how what how did you kind of go
350,career side but they get all knotted
351,cartons of paper North Texas those
352,certainly from from my second book on my
353,certainly made so much more fluid and
354,challenge what if I allowed the computer
355,change this and I'll change something
356,changed at all I don't think it has
357,changed at all I mean there was a time
358,changes but I made some changes here and
359,changes much about the way I compose but
360,clarity but with the kind of evocative
361,class discussion together with all sorts
362,close to read key for couldn't he
363,closet in the basement or are like
364,code I forgotten the original question
365,cold weather I build a fire get it
366,collection and then I guess once you you
367,collection and this is mostly what I've
368,collection of poems there if there's an
369,columns in because it was kind of a
370,combined them all into one for
371,come back up and stay till about 5:00
372,come from from ideas they tend to come
373,come next and so before you were using
374,come out and I'll look at the shelves
375,come out and that's why this there's
376,come out here and sit down and make a
377,come to you when you were younger and
378,comes to be in life but the problem with
379,comfort and use of it has that sort of
380,committed to the closet a lot much
381,committee I can get them to schedule
382,communicate so quickly yeah but then you
383,communication that's going on through
384,communications a lot of the
385,communications you know I've got just
386,compact a little tiny laptop as we
387,completely changes my focus once I know
388,compose on always I compose prose on the
389,composed on the computer the whole of it
390,composing what I don't have anything in
391,comprised in the same number of lines
392,compulsive syllable counter even if
393,computer and and that's and I've been
394,computer and fear is a little different
395,computer but it kept me from writing
396,computer came along was it it saved time
397,computer coming through your teaching
398,computer did it do you find yourself
399,computer I can't imagine being a prose
400,computer I think that you know a lot of
401,computer moving poems and in different
402,computer onto an external drive now I
403,computer screen for a long time before I
404,computer that was nothing but poems that
405,computer was after I was in this little
406,connected yeah yeah I'm I when I built
407,consider anything complete until I print
408,consult just to sort of trip on the
409,convenient but it's not as it isn't as
410,convert myself to part-time writing
411,copies it was a lot easier to get to the
412,correspond much now with other writers
413,correspondence and but I guess overall
414,could but I could do the selected
415,could hang on the wall that says cutting
416,could have been with writing longhand or
417,could have been you don't want to drive
418,could have left them on it wouldn't hurt
419,could make you see what you were doing
420,couldn't bear rejection and I figured
421,couldn't really didn't want me to do it
422,couldn't write here all I do is look out
423,couple and there's no internet and kids
424,couple different sections the first
425,couple of old ones here that went held
426,couple of others egad I'll just pick it
427,course of writing whereas it has it been
428,course of your career you see like
429,crashes and whatnot in the earlier days
430,crazy at penguin because they're always
431,cutting and I cut 600 lines it's called
432,cuz they were they've already broadcast
433,dad I mean
434,dangerous for me in the beginning I
435,date but then you resave it you modified
436,date I'll have it and it works so well
437,date on it and the number of see just
438,daughter's the one who let me know of
439,David Baker a few years ago just to you
440,day it's very easy to do that it's a
441,day when I'm gone just doing regular
442,day-to-day life I mean there's much more
443,dead so I get this is a sort of simple
444,den it's great to get to meet you and
445,DES it was fine then it's got this
446,describing sort of TS Eliot versus Pound
447,desperation and on this yeah
448,despised toward cram
449,device to the other no I try to keep I
450,dick was a completely other kind of
451,did one of these already with Nancy and
452,did that how did that sort of change you
453,did you start using those
454,didn't actually ask you one question I
455,didn't get to see much of all bruh
456,didn't know what it was right in the
457,didn't want a job but I wound up working
458,didn't want to be a poet I never really
459,difference between there's boxes as well
460,differences between you are moving back
461,different feeling a different service I
462,difficult his files will be you know
463,digital analog method of of notation and
464,disadvantage I don't have I don't have
465,disadvantages really I have no sort of
466,disadvantages you see it I don't see any
467,disaster
468,discomfort with the idea of theme
469,discovered that I preferred easily the
470,discovered there was this degree called
471,distinct shifts or do you sort of see it
472,do have a lot of paper right and and I
473,do I am wired out here yeah but I try to
474,do I mean look how neat that it's just
475,do it still

507,draft of a poem that's that's the part I
508,drafts worksheets whatever you want to
509,drive before how did you what was that
510,drive me nuts so I does it had
511,driven by sounds is given by being
512,driven by structure of the poem in
513,earlier part of your career to get
514,early on here but I'll give you an get
515,earthing meditations which originally
516,easiest one to find I've got a gmail

536,enjoying anatomy melancholy
537,envelope with a letter it's it's much
538,envisioned it when I retire permanent
539,especially in graduate classes
540,especially in things like that are the
541,especially like to move all that all
542,Eurovision do they play a role not a
543,even attainable career goal I was a I
544,even before that I had some other kind
545,even evenly stacked is pretty much the
546,eventually I began to see that and I
547,ever heard use that term but they are no
548,ever since and that's when I really
549,every page is dated
550,every place you know every place in the
551,every time I came out here I just plug
552,everybody else said is the best thing
553,everybody hopes that they might write
554,everything back down and for a long time
555,everything from the hard drive of the
556,everything you want to cover okay we
557,everywhere else I was and then wound up
558,exact I thought I had it exactly the way
559,except by academics as as they once
560,except that it is you sort of hear the
561,exercising syllables are adding
562,exhaust those things or nothing in the
563,exist is he yes well through tenure yeah
564,experiences like that I mean I I'm
565,exposure but did you have like letters
566,extended six months and and bingo I was
567,extent but of people who would do that
568,external hard drive where backed up
569,extraneous seemingly
570,extraneous to bring into the pump so I
571,extremely helpful are you talking a
572,fact that it appeared in print in one
573,famous I mean II edited Eat Pray Love uh
574,fantastic
575,far across the page whereas I could tell
576,far before I began what I felt was in
577,fashions because I love going back I can
578,fatty
579,favorite has been like 400 lines that's
580,feel like it's done
581,few months was waylaid by poetry I
582,few more questions I want to talk a

592,finding ways to to maintain a kind of
593,finish it off somehow it rhymes and it's
594,first book manuscript that penguin

596,first draft in this formuoli dress in
597,first incidence of saying I get this
598,first started trying to compose or do
599,focused on computers in saving and it's
600,follow-up email that tried to bind the
601,foot tall anyway but he didn't want to
602,for 22 years that was not a great job
603,for a poet because the teaching load was
604,for a word a title of phrase anything
605,for a year and applied for jobs as close
606,for a year and the graduate students
607,for for for a long time and then somehow
608,for it and then they can have all the
609,for me and I'm not in any hurry to know
610,for me I mean my first three books for
611,for me which they offered me and I

686,great pedagogical tool that way um hey
687,guess doing the best I can and if we
688,guess what sort of mode is your revision
689,guys I think I've exhausted it Oh unless
690,had a whole lot of use for poetry I took
691,had been published in magazines say and
692,had done such good work it's kind of
693,had this 3/4 terabyte hard drive that
694,had to scrounge around for a pen to sign
695,handwriting became something I did that
696,handwritten page numbers on it when I
697,happened although the first film I ever
698,happened first but I got to working on
699,happens to be handwritten and old
700,harbor but I've never come and you can
701,hard can it be doesn't have to go very
702,hard copy somehow and and look at them
703,hard drive back when I had a PC I had an
704,hard so I had to do a lot of penciling
705,harddrive I think I nearly filled it up
706,has been entirely electronic all these
707,has changed over the course of years
708,hasn't worked that way for me that was
709,hate to revise it's like hating writing
710,have a couple of I have a couple of
711,have a good sense of your writing
712,have a we have a hot tub Oh which is one
713,have a year on them or a period of years
714,have anything occurs for most of it yeah
715,have done it probably I would have done
716,have I mean I've got like exactly
717,have not but did you have any
718,have something called the rule of the
719,have the thing I thought was best about
720,have this tray down here this wooden
721,have to do with the frost it'll have to
722,have to love to revise because that's
723,have to plug it into a PC somewhere
724,have what we'll see see how because it
725,have you been writing in this spot I
726,having that poem broken into turrets
727,Hawthorn and Rachelle has been there oh
728,he he's TC Boyle's editor Paul slovic
729,he never really had the belly for the
730,he says and then they send me a contract
731,helped me see that you just said no
732,her but you know knopf insisted you got
733,her students I mean she was doing it
734,her the NSA must have a file five feet
735,here he wants to move copies in because
736,here just did that look at it go
737,here since then basically in the same
738,here this
739,he's a prose writer though they lose
740,he's not going to tell you I got
741,hilarious because he's very funny
742,hired here I published dragon snakes
743,his brother Jesus Christ who was born
744,his widow so it's what I put on whatever
745,hole great great no this is here we have
746,honey there's a big question mark but
747,hornet's nest about the so around up in
748,hours just just kind of messing around
749,how does that sort of change your
750,how I could have done without the
751,how that came about
752,how this come take me seriously well I
753,how this goes into a book and everything
754,how to get going I know how to get out
755,however one pronounces that I can never
756,Hugo would say is needs to you need to
757,hundred lines at a time and I got to go
758,hundred lines long in barely drafts and
759,hundred some-odd lines long this
760,hurry yeah although Random House is now
761,I at some point this winter I need to
762,I buy I think I may be part of the
763,I can promise to have this book
764,I can't guarantee that I won't be boring
765,I come out here um well I'm one to talk
766,I convinced them that I should have a
767,I could I could immediately just look at
768,I decide that that's done then again it
769,I did I think however when I when I
770,I did I was interviewed by a young woman
771,I did the selected poems both here and
772,I didn't finish this one what slips it
773,I didn't have much luck I didn't have
774,I do and I miss let's see I got that's a
775,I do I have I have this which is sort of
776,I don't I don't I don't have that kind
777,I don't know it's something that I
778,I don't organize them but I look for
779,I find something in this batch before it
780,I got to start on what I'm working on
781,I got ya I got sort of I got sort of
782,I guess we sort of talked about this but
783,I had a Poetry Festival which was
784,I had I had an IBM Selectric I guess
785,I had this one poem which was actually
786,I hate using the word idea though
787,I have this weekend writer-in-residence
788,I hope you can hear that insult yeah
789,I kind of like something about them all
790,I knew something was missing but I
791,I love Dryden I love Pope but I can only
792,I mean I'd every time I get through a
793,I mean people ask me now are you working
794,I mean you know you it was you were what
795,I need to I need to develop that spot I
796,I need you to put in or I've taken out
797,I sent it to Dorian and Henry and Phil
798,I think extraordinary is a big bug
799,I think I mean it changes in a sort of I
800,I think I said the me mail so it every
801,I think I was I'm less concerned with
802,I think it fell down was an enormous
803,I think it's good I'm on sabbatical
804,I think it's one of the reasons that
805,I think much to their detriment both on
806,I think so it's I mean I did I don't I
807,I think that I discovered or realized
808,I think that was one of the interesting
809,I think the Brits appreciated that too
810,I think there was one huge sort of shift
811,I want to I want to say to those things
812,I want to use the word organic here was
813,I wanted it but the first poem in the
814,I when I finished it I knew what I
815,I wondered about well what am I missing
816,I wrote a lot of letters letters were
817,I wrote that that book and that was the
818,I'd like to deliver in spring 2012 okay
819,I'd never wanted him to hear me say that
820,I'd play Dylan Thomas on on the sand I
821,idea
822,idea of being able to communicate
823,idea what book it is I'm reaching for
824,ideas where because they tend not to
825,idiot let me find it
826,idiotic right
827,if I had them organized in some way but
828,if I missed anything that there's some
829,if you got any time between 2:00 and
830,if you when do you consider a piece of
831,ignorant of me there are prose poems I
832,I'll be fine
833,I'll do this on on computer yeah this
834,I'll fiddle with
835,I'll just have an asterisk and seven
836,I'll sit down I'll spend the first two
837,I'll start from that it's great great
838,Illinois press and I had this kind of
839,I'm aligned around that and I'm not
840,I'm dealing with the thing in the
841,I'm in no way thought two years ago
842,I'm just I'm not going to mess with it
843,I'm not interested I'd rather write
844,I'm not interested in in paper anymore
845,I'm not really interested in reading
846,I'm not there I'm not going there I
847,I'm serious about this debt enhancement
848,image occurs to me or a phrase where I
849,imagination of language can convert what
850,immediately make a tenure-track position
851,impatient with the sort of the the
852,important a wonderful poet on a couple
853,important I don't know that that's
854,important to me in terms of of the craft
855,important whereas in in the notebook you
856,in 1979 was my MFA thesis basically and
857,in a couple of poems that correspond
858,in a line I want to make that sound
859,in all your all your poems are in one
860,in an envelope and a delivery date and I
861,in Boise and as always well I I don't
862,in in reading and sharing what I'm
863,in journals yeah quite a few more
864,in London for a couple of days which was
865,in love with living in this part of the
866,in mozi so I feel pretty sanguine about
867,in my little studio building which is
868,in Reverse maybe you know in Montana and
869,in Scotland who asked me if I could talk
870,in some way just that much more
871,in somewhere in those many boxes in the
872,in the first sort of stages of the
873,in the published book in the last poem
874,in the published book used to the first
875,in the UK I made some changes not big
876,in there probably an inch and a half
877,in this corner it's a black funnel
878,in this space so so here's this sort of
879,in your writing process you see over the
880,inches tall he was not that tall
881,incredibly wonderful but you can only go
882,incrementally and syllables not that the
883,indication or I'm going to be kind with
884,individual poems here I have batches of
885,individual poems work how this
886,information retrieval system it just
887,inland or I had another check very
888,inside Bennett at U of I
889,inspire but they seem that way to me now
890,instead of quatrains and that was so
891,intensely meditative poem that I wrote I
892,interest me something eventually is
893,interested in in that particular thing
894,interested in poems that can be sent to
895,interested in pulling things out okay
896,interested in that image to the poem
897,interesting because it was put on the
898,interesting conversation so she's doing
899,interesting to to know if this
900,internet play roles you like is that
901,intimate and that and I suppose or it
902,into it I mean that basically also I'll
903,into manipulating syntax to keep the
904,into one and I'll feel sort of
905,into storage in the in the basement
906,into the class and I got absolutely
907,into the notebooks which I do with some
908,into three portions one being kind of
909,invariably correct oh yeah you're right
910,is a so compute shortest imputed it had
911,is asana the as it stands now which
912,is definitely some of the questions um
913,is is suited to poetry and not so much
914,is kind of coming some other reading but
915,is more specifically about computers and
916,is something much more than that
917,is sort of an interesting thing to have
918,is supposed to have some sort of little
919,is the computer I have one laptop that's
920,is then I've been considering it right
921,is there an intention behind the
922,is very friendly to me and they're
923,is virtue because it is and and I'm and
924,is what I'm saying I couldn't just leave
925,isn't as a tool so I don't tend to to do
926,issue with oh wow you had a Lincoln
927,it allows you to dispense words
928,it and find it just the way you left it
929,it and then and Rodney Jones that
930,it as it can have maybe as many possible
931,it backed up all my photographs as well
932,it but it would have been a much more
933,it call Exxon and I got a hundred and
934,it can be 20 or 30 or 50 lines if it's
935,it didn't hurt to just kill the the
936,it different now that you kind of know
937,it doesn't have to rhyme anymore you
938,it has and can will continue so I don't
939,it I guess it okay the more the more
940,it in and it was on automatic backup and
941,it is I see into some kind of a phrase
942,it may be that eventually I'll get to a
943,it might be an illusion but I don't
944,it more organic when you just kind of
945,it no no I know what you mean although I
946,it off and then set it off into the
947,it on the screen go back to longhand and
948,it one two three four five six seven
949,it the marketplace the literary world he
950,it was fine that was great but then the
951,it was I've still got the other I've
952,it was read Keys North American sequence
953,it was very cool I have been really
954,it was with the typewriter even before
955,it were ah I didn't realize it but I
956,it whatever is I mean it sort I guess
957,it when you have those deadlines is it
958,it you know and then back in the back
959,it'll be great they'll be in figuring
960,it'll be this big so I can't I don't
961,it's a pretty good deal but it you know
962,it's a structural unit but then I
963,it's a vastly more elusive book too than
964,it's all that's the way I look at it so
965,it's been great having her I thought she
966,it's called earthquake light let's see
967,its evocative to me now you know I'm
968,it's from that point on I have not had
969,it's in beautiful country shit what does
970,it's it's a pretty it's a pretty good
971,it's it's hard yeah and I write a lot
972,it's it's sort of a big shift because
973,it's just a whole lot of files some of
974,it's just something about the color will
975,it's more you know the interaction of
976,it's not easy and it's a failed epic god
977,it's not if it's when yeah and it hasn't
978,it's pronounced all bro
979,it's so easy to drag-and-drop to cut and
980,it's such an easy distraction on the
981,it's surprising because in some ways
982,it's the same number of lines I can
983,it's which is not not possible but I did
984,I've added two more lines we need you to
985,I've been doing all I have to say okay
986,I've been recording like me I did I did
987,I've enjoyed many halls but let that one
988,I've got a file on one of my two email
989,I've got I probably have a hundred
990,I've got I think in sort of most
991,I've got I've got a few people who are
992,I've just been lucky enough that it
993,I've known Billy for a long time too but
994,I've never had to order these online now
995,I've not done six books yeah and my one
996,I've operated it's gotten complicated
997,Jack and most recently I sent a batch to
998,job came along I I snapped it up hey
999,John Haynes and probably most famously
1000,July or August or September or October
1001,just a sort of glorified typewriter with
1002,just I keep doing what I do and if
1003,just kidding I know twice just stop
1004,just like if I should want to which I
1005,just listen to him say this gorgeous
1006,just start putting words on paper it'll
1007,just started writing them down yeah and
1008,just that was terrific then went to lobs
1009,just to keep the old hard drive from
1010,just to see this 12 pound marble book
1011,just yeah ignited electronically no
1012,keep reading theoretically at least I've
1013,keeping them in the file I don't know
1014,keeping track of things yeah I mean
1015,kick in the pants but she's also big on
1016,Kim's not on sabbatical she worked out
1017,kind of add some sort of more pointed
1018,kind of best practices for digital
1019,kind of has like a focusing
1020,kind of keep track of all this stuff and
1021,kind of like a typewriter except that
1022,kind of mess of that and like I mean you
1023,kind of order they go most recent to
1024,kind of permanence which is dangerous I
1025,kind of quickly and then we'll get to
1026,kind of step that gets left out that was
1027,kind of structure that in fact was that
1028,kind of the way I warmed up okay when I
1029,knew back years ago I didn't have a
1030,Knicks 9 when I started converting it to
1031,Knopf Scott a huge list does one
1032,know draft number 22 and eventually once
1033,know get some feedback on and and I said
1034,know how when you save something in say
1035,know I don't I probably write ten
1036,know I starts with a date and every page
1037,know once you're at that point that you
1038,know that this was interesting how come
1039,know the way a musician would noodle
1040,know what's up with that
1041,know which is which I have to keep okay
1042,know you need you just need to have a
1043,know you're right it doesn't change much
1044,know you've got published collections
1045,know-how or or the resourcefulness to
1046,knows and you if you're if you're
1047,language somehow the lens of the writing
1048,larger fabric and that has been assisted
1049,last few times I have sent poems off to
1050,last poem that big poems that went into
1051,last that makes you pretty normal but
1052,LCSC in 1977 I was a sabbatical
1053,learned from Sarah Madeleine DeFries
1054,less boring quite honestly and it may
1055,less intimate right great I don't have a
1056,let er rip so okay so I've got sort of a
1057,let her some Gwendolyn Brooks I did
1058,let's do a class emails and just with
1059,letter from Philippine he wrote me
1060,letter it's not like getting an email
1061,letter writing to well it made little
1062,letters
1063,letters twelve letters a year now and
1064,lie down because they just did not know
1065,life you manage your career and
1066,like 12 13 hours on campus Tuesday and
1067,like a craft lecture or something
1068,like a perfectly appropriate and maybe
1069,like a real poem in that phrase and so
1070,like and they tend to be people who've
1071,like anything else I've ever written so
1072,like anything I gave
1073,like how did you kind of learn how to
1074,like how does these person you know make
1075,like most of the job ah you know if you
1076,like multimedia yeah electronics no it

1078,like that and if I were to do something
1079,like that if someone comes along and
1080,like the night leaks mugger like right
1081,like to tell them my own experience
1082,like well we were there for four days
1083,like you know like the cotton and this
1084,line and do a search and find it
1085,lineage of poets who sometimes can't
1086,lineage or of that sort you know like
1087,lines on the computer screen and saying
1088,lines the way they are and I'm a
1089,linkages yeah a lot of people do I think
1090,Linus send me what you got I sent him
1091,literature I think it was but anyway
1092,little arrows and checks and numbers and
1093,little bit about correspondence in a
1094,little bit about I mean these it is like
1095,little bit about teaching but so do you
1096,little bit more and crossing out and
1097,little draft of a poem called goodbye to
1098,little ended its intended your favorite
1099,little fellows in a moleskin a or
1100,little notebook interest to me so I just
1101,little pat no gorilla steakhouse Hill
1102,loaded rhyme at the end and I like and
1103,location how do you say like how do you
1104,locations throughout the text and
1105,long days I teach Tuesdays and Thursdays
1106,longhand and part-time writing on the
1107,longhand or printing actually I print
1108,look and think I look how cool is this
1109,look at 118 and and and I'll have
1110,look at it when it was divided into
1111,looking for is to get at that particular
1112,lose anything but it keeping track of
1113,lose hundreds of pages right right yeah
1114,lose track of I mean most of these are
1115,lot of not maybe through the rest of
1116,lot of things there's a pile of drafts
1117,lot of times is what's what in which
1118,love but yet I've never I've never
1119,love Moscow and I love Idaho and I've
1120,loved it so much that I'm buying these
1121,loved most
1122,lower your standards you quit trying to
1123,luxury to be on sabbatical or as I
1124,luxury to have time it's an even greater
1125,machine changer for opinion on that
1126,machines do just because the university
1127,made me happy never not like writing a
1128,magazines and got a poem published in
1129,magazines are accepting submissions
1130,mail or you get letters from from people
1131,make a book out of but mostly I'm just
1132,make me feel like I wasn't you Eve yeah
1133,make those kinds of changes and and I
1134,make to just to make it easier to find
1135,make use of I know exactly when I first
1136,making any changes of the collection
1137,manuscript calm this of such-and-such a
1138,many different ways you don't really
1139,many of them don't suck I think there's
1140,mater and the department of the skinny
1141,maybe don't really simple but I the
1142,maybe talk a little bit about how that
1143,me this inclination toward a particular
1144,mean about my drive my poor copy editor
1145,mean but you I mean you can see I don't
1146,mean I am but I should get if she
1147,mean I can go back and look at like I
1148,mean I I'm I'm a product of the creative
1149,mean I still do this the old-fashioned
1150,mean I think I think and and no one
1151,mean I was on I was on a Guggenheim when
1152,mean instead of about yeah III think
1153,mean it still got your sort you know
1154,mean I've always got I've got a couple
1155,mean that's facetious of course but I
1156,meaning electronic devices either or
1157,mechanism yeah so I I'm not too worried
1158,meditations beautiful country and now
1159,meetings on Wednesday if they don't want
1160,Memorial and I've never had a response
1161,meter and as far as I could tell most
1162,method were seriously digital analog not
1163,metrons different about it and if you
1164,Microsoft Word
1165,mid 90s mid 90s and that you started
1166,Middle East I mean the course they're
1167,middle of the book is this other long
1168,might have been because there's just so
1169,miles north of Moscow Idaho and how long
1170,mind if you're repeating yourself as
1171,mine we talked a little bit latest set
1172,minimally minimally minor you give
1173,miss or profession will be coming I mean
1174,missed this sometimes and I go back and
1175,moment that that problem of like
1176,Montana and then I went to I went back
1177,months old so you know it's going to be
1178,moon in a mason jar that's spinning
1179,moose and bigger and you're not quite
1180,more about your writing process in
1181,more all of a piece somehow and that
1182,more because you do me the favor of
1183,more comfortable than with with just
1184,more friendly it would just be a lot
1185,more friendly or intimate kind of
1186,more overarching on your practice over
1187,more permanent now given that I live in
1188,more unusual circumstances what drives
1189,more when you're writing longhand but
1190,more with computers I really did not
1191,mornings and I mean is there like set
1192,most recent couple of these to just
1193,most to be oldest um on the bottom of
1194,mostly I was if as a model for that poem
1195,mostly it's always seemed to me that the
1196,mostly sort of hybridized I like I like
1197,mother who always embroidered
1198,move in from revision you're always
1199,moving from in sort of one fell swoop
1200,moving some product me um your
1201,much been my routine really for a long
1202,much luck making actual poems until all
1203,much of it so maybe being sort of in
1204,my father believed and beautiful country
1205,my my private computer which sometimes I
1206,my students accuse me of hitting pros
1207,my that first note so that when I come
1208,my you can always tell there's no return
1209,myself and I can do that on the computer
1210,myself standing next to the statue of
1211,name your date of birth in the location
1212,need it's like with the sonnet I don't
1213,need to go by what an external drive for
1214,need to go somewhere else I need to
1215,need to write in in these things with
1216,needs to be mean and and sometimes you
1217,negative side you know you're here
1218,never had to go retrieve anything but
1219,never have any issues with it whereas PC
1220,never really written before or who are
1221,Newark C and katha pollitt they were the
1222,Newcastle and Hull I've got a picture of
1223,next
1224,next being sort of revisional with how
1225,nitty-gritty of it well it might be
1226,no I tell the students the graduate
1227,no I well no and you know my colleague
1228,no particular order in this I mean these
1229,no way to be outside at night unless
1230,nobody else Putnam publishes Linda
1231,nonfiction writer talks about all great
1232,nonsense is often called it or I'd read
1233,noonish 12:30 between 12:30 and 1:00
1234,North program summer it takes more three
1235,not a lot of there's not a lot of love
1236,not a success home like I said I've only
1237,not all that resourceful with the
1238,not have been boring it is not still
1239,not have to go from the typewritten
1240,not stay connected very awesome because
1241,not sure which of those drafts I prefer
1242,not to fiction I did I have in fact
1243,notebook but it would look different it
1244,notebook itself you can you can or I can
1245,notebook which could you describe what
1246,notes to myself sometimes notes and
1247,notes tools tools yeah uh I just saw a
1248,nothing and all of that stuff you know I
1249,novel about she downloaded maps of all
1250,now and then and if I do wind up
1251,now just breathe all I would comfort
1252,now of course it's just such a breeze
1253,now well of course I'm especially fond
1254,numbers and 186 maybe go into the
1255,numbers so I thought this is insane and
1256,observed have you ever received her
1257,occasion Dorian lux's has looked at
1258,occasionally this has not happened to
1259,occurred to me simply because the so
1260,of 1995 and I really honestly that this
1261,of a lot of tight spaces I know how to
1262,of a sudden I did yeah
1263,of an intermediary thing although
1264,of any sort of like their sort of
1265,of anything so I began to be a whole lot
1266,of copies made me a lot of money I
1267,of course but he's published I think two
1268,of course it does I mean when I in the
1269,of delineate a difference between how
1270,of electric typewriter but uh and I
1271,of Express no and yeah well you get some
1272,of failed poet
1273,of files in there this just called fan
1274,of gets us started but I mean the next
1275,of it because it's like the newest baby
1276,of line and yeah and I wish you will
1277,of my my father 24/7 I would have my
1278,of network of other writers any sort of
1279,of occasions Phil Levine has looked at
1280,of on to sort of how you organize you
1281,of our great indulgences but you know
1282,of poems I ever sent out I got something
1283,of poetry and I don't think my notion of
1284,of references and links to other things
1285,of some of these some of the margin me
1286,of that may just be that I've gotten to
1287,of the hole and the sections there n
1288,of the millennium I think for me and it
1289,of thing
1290,of time looking out the window but
1291,of turrets and still have the poem be
1292,of well the kind of thing that was more
1293,of what
1294,of writers that I did and it's more
1295,off a long draught and then I'd start
1296,off put them in a box and eliminate them
1297,off relentlessly
1298,off so it tapers heavy so I guess you
1299,off that there stay still love me but
1300,offered that degree in 1972 I think and
1301,office hours and hopefully if I'm on a
1302,often it was just another poet another
1303,oh I'm subtracting okay absolutely I
1304,oh no I just sat down the computer and
1305,oh sections crossed out so I guess you
1306,oh yeah Harrison okay how does it work
1307,okay and read at a place called the
1308,okay bingo and that sort of thing I
1309,okay I have a Mac what is it a MacBook
1310,okay it's a you know yeah it's a it's
1311,okay so first you would please face your
1312,okay so that's sort of a general
1313,okay so when you first started writing
1314,old and seemingly laborious manual
1315,on a book no I'm just writing poems yeah
1316,on a jump drive I think maybe too he
1317,on a kind of lark what happened if I
1318,on barriers I don't know well it on the
1319,on Moscow mountain not far well six
1320,on the computer screen let's say now in
1321,on the computer somewhere prowling
1322,on the Hasek I was reading and I heard
1323,on the U of I account because that's the
1324,on them if it takes me long until one
1325,on well that's sort of been the way I've
1326,on what you go don't want you to go as a
1327,once it's gone into bigger file oh
1328,once my papers it would be a lot happier
1329,once you how do you then you just
1330,one a low first question is when did you
1331,one device you ever moved things for one
1332,one I think that's one Kim retired
1333,one in Canada and applied to a number of
1334,one of the colonies this is the gemstone
1335,one of these no when this was 1996 I
1336,one of those fit your mode or is he
1337,one on on BBC four which is they tell me
1338,one's not pinning you you have to
1339,online yeah you find you have to
1340,only way I can get started is to just
1341,or come by they can just ask you and
1342,or five anonymous letters from some
1343,or not the large arc of your career and
1344,or or and then moving to the computer
1345,or staying the same as well I think III
1346,or three books and they've all been
1347,order to have some sense of what might
1348,organic for me about having the vision
1349,organize your stuff on the computer
1350,organizing poems in the book rain of
1351,orient revise drink no no I do when I
1352,other hand we we came and I enjoyed
1353,other kind of a reference a poem as Dick
1354,other people I think I said something
1355,other place I was really interested or
1356,other poets other writers but I don't
1357,other stanzas so I
1358,other stone okay
1359,other the example that occurs to me is
1360,other thing and it's the other thing
1361,other thing how can I make what this
1362,other thing Tony tony early the fiction
1363,other whole set of files so I am
1364,oughta had a comma there but by the way
1365,our conversation together and the email
1366,our correspondence over the last decade
1367,out early on
1368,out here by between my
1369,out here or where I go wherever it was I
1370,out longhand or you certainly feel them
1371,out of hell I got here I guess like what
1372,out or it usually holds ten reams of
1373,out that prose poem in stanzas had to be
1374,overview and then I'd like to kind of
1375,overwhelming sense of their being in arc
1376,owns the machine and I'd really don't
1377,page by the hand of the poet rather than
1378,page seven or or asked are a check 1:18
1379,paper right before these things that
1380,papers especially Western writers yeah
1381,part is where I tell my students I mean
1382,part of it too but publication you know
1383,part so there's a a poem on your
1384,particular on my mind whereas in the
1385,particular poet does his or her work and
1386,particular something and what I'm
1387,particular sound that appeals to me or
1388,particular title and that's it or
1389,particularly like or feel is evocative
1390,particularly strange because so many
1391,particularly were just enormous ly
1392,paste with a computer that it's it's
1393,Paul Muldoon and and that you know it's
1394,pay by the pound ha ha ha
1395,pen date on the corner of the draft just
1396,penciled in I thought about winding and
1397,pencils and pens and notebooks do you
1398,penguin all won prizes then it cooled
1399,Penguin Books over there because I'd
1400,penguin Random House and nobody knows
1401,people are much more resourceful with it
1402,people couldn't figure out what it meant
1403,people do you know beyond debt I have
1404,people I know a lot of poets I know of
1405,people like Pope probably are just red
1406,people tell me all the time when you
1407,people who buy so many piles of writers
1408,people you know people always ask things
1409,perceived the book this book and three
1410,perfectly comfortable just looking at
1411,person who hates me
1412,Philip Larkin in the train station oh
1413,phrase or it kind of moved toward an
1414,pick up that cell I call it sounds
1415,picture sir now if this is recording I'm
1416,pile called crank I've gotten like four
1417,place where you you surprise yourself
1418,places where when I get an idea or an
1419,Plath or and read the book of nightmares
1420,plumbers block I can't help you and and
1421,poem and such and such or then poems
1422,poem did so anyway I got I got waylaid
1423,poem go someplace else it might not have
1424,poem I lay him out on the floor but then
1425,poem in beautiful country is two hundred
1426,poem in lines on the word processor and
1427,poem is after and that what is
1428,poem to happen and it used to be as I
1429,poems and everything then it's mozi or
1430,poems and when email came along that
1431,poems for me Henry Carlyle who is only
1432,poems that have been published with the
1433,poems that have been submitted over here
1434,poems yeah and so what kind of devices
1435,poet friend I'd write him a letter
1436,poetry almost exclusively every now and
1437,Pope's and think if this had been cut by
1438,position opened up here and the only
1439,position same job and over this time
1440,possibilities of the poem might be and
1441,practices when you first started I mean
1442,prefer the process to the product
1443,preferred to have written to writing I
1444,presented it or does it or actually is
1445,pretty aware of what I'm up to and but
1446,pretty young program really yeah you
1447,prewriting read your notes I print off a
1448,prewriting those kind of development of
1449,primary mode of textual changes it's an
1450,primary motive probably around the turn
1451,print all of them all some i some I do
1452,print out and then do extensive
1453,printed off I got a whole file just of
1454,prints things I mean he's he's anal
1455,probably be a good idea to do something
1456,probably try to find them all huh no I
1457,process I can we more concerned about
1458,process there anything as you do I mean
1459,professional about it as a plumber is I
1460,professionally in which I mean something
1461,program to determine where the ends of
1462,programs wound up going to Montana fell
1463,prose poem in stanzas okay
1464,publicity who is now my editor who is
1465,publish a book of mine I can I can make
1466,published a couple of short stories
1467,published a poem in The New Yorker lot
1468,published and therefore might be
1469,published book used to be the last poem
1470,published I mean I that was all typed on
1471,published one less than a year ago right
1472,published reign of snakes the year I was
1473,publisher need for poetry lists what's
1474,publishing is your career you live your
1475,pull the get the hard drive out and
1476,pulling the one off the top this is a
1477,puny yeah but I've cut the the longest
1478,put it down yeah yeah okay so so that
1479,put it in a book it's it's it's finished
1480,put it in a different place you
1481,put stuff in boxes that's pretty well
1482,put them all together or you say oh I
1483,put things into the cloud the iCloud I
1484,put together that book manuscript and
1485,putting a poem as an attachment and send
1486,putting together a book manuscript I my
1487,quadrant more or less the same structure
1488,qualifies is failure and ambition and so
1489,quatrain the first quatrain ends with
1490,question is sort of like could you give
1491,question was that it does it seem I mean
1492,question yeah I kept I have always and I
1493,questions about computer and using
1494,questions that are sort of getting at
1495,quick and dirty questions but so what's
1496,Random House publishes Billy Collins and
1497,rather have theoretically Monday and
1498,read poems out of books at all bruh and
1499,reader and she's knows me so well that
1500,reading more like that people keep
1501,reading situations how do you feel about
1502,readings as through our readers what do
1503,realized that you know wait a minute I
1504,really been interested in writing one
1505,really beginning of work and various I
1506,really I just talked with Terence Hayes
1507,really is the kind of storage kind of
1508,really kind of do I'm delighted by the
1509,really loved the finished product or
1510,really most leads our first graph still
1511,really need any I don't need an idea I
1512,really stops once I get it in this in
1513,really trust the poem I was this not
1514,really willing correspondence and write
1515,reason or another I'm uncertain of the
1516,regard I think that it that it's just
1517,regularity just to sift through and see
1518,relationship to computers that they sort
1519,relying on them you know yeah so if I
1520,remember it and you know if I just go to
1521,repeating ourselves if you don't mind
1522,replacement for you
1523,respond and I do it's also great though
1524,retrieve everything hard drive was fine
1525,retrieve something off a forest fire
1526,revise that's a really good question
1527,revising the drill but then you're also
1528,revising you have there an intention
1529,revision general exam and so you're
1530,revision on the computer and the
1531,revision or you just sort of follow well
1532,revision process when I get seriously
1533,revisions on arrows things crossed out
1534,rhyme when I make a sound that I
1535,Richard Hugo and and they were you know
1536,ridiculous but yeah I'm loving me the
1537,right and something about saving and
1538,right and then I guess I mean we didn't
1539,right and what you were doing wrong with
1540,right in this spot and she's almost
1541,right margin mattering and and somehow
1542,right offer positive well yeah I should
1543,right right so I I I get it back out and
1544,right yeah and both stood by the time I
1545,rips through when I'm gone and it burns
1546,routine do you come out here in the
1547,sabbatical and two as I am now
1548,sabbatical yeah we'll see about that
1549,sacred ever but mostly when I'm ready to
1550,said hold homes would happen dog in
1551,said researcher should he or she ever
1552,said um you can't hate to realise you
1553,said well you know you're getting
1554,saying already done it I want to do that
1555,says what I do it from classes Jesus oh
1556,school she knows her stuff she says
1557,Scotland so much we I've been trying to
1558,Scottish poetry library which is just
1559,screen gives it the appearance more of a
1560,screen I mean there was nothing special
1561,seamlessness but not a kind of
1562,second-guess yourself you quit sitting
1563,section is based on that initial survey
1564,section of questions and I want to ask
1565,sections in each of the four parts and
1566,sections is part of the assemblage of
1567,sections so that each of I mean it seems
1568,see 99 the year I the year I was hired I
1569,see how that works so I guess the last
1570,see I got my first computer in the fall
1571,see I see five points I've been doing
1572,see or hear opportunities to to let the
1573,see some phrase I I make a note I make
1574,see the paper bald feels boldface
1575,see the possibility of substituting a
1576,see there there's some connective tissue
1577,see where the poem goes just to see
1578,seeing it on the screen in the computer
1579,seemed like a great way into the book
1580,seems far less effective to me to sit
1581,seems like I'm having good luck and part
1582,seems to me that it would it would
1583,seen that I would have seen if I'd been
1584,self-published
1585,send my now I send the editor an email
1586,send those well the Georgia review and
1587,sent out got accepted by our first batch
1588,sequence called rain of snakes yeah and
1589,sequence over the course of like two
1590,service as well
1591,serviceable in a collection somewhere
1592,seven eight and and all and then you go
1593,shade on a swindle or a value I didn't I
1594,she can just she can tell when she needs
1595,she did that nothing but and she never
1596,she said okay this stanza here needs to
1597,sheet back to the notebook so there is a
1598,she's a special woman she is
1599,she's the one who says okay here's what
1600,should have said or ways to connect
1601,should I talked to Daniel Orosco a lot
1602,should if I'd had to completely retype
1603,shut up
1604,side into the poems and those kinds of
1605,similar to this and that was how I
1606,simple way of explaining it her simple
1607,simplicity I mean what I really I don't
1608,simultaneously the the arc of my career
1609,since 1972
1610,since since moon in a mason jar that
1611,Singh that issue up there the Obama
1612,six poems in the title of what I
1613,slowness of the process writing my
1614,Smithsonian wanted to see if all Lizzie
1615,snakes lives and the animals earthly
1616,snakes yeah which is a very sound driven
1617,snippets which I find myself compelled
1618,so about 2007
1619,so and to that extent I guess I
1620,so are you kidding me you should you're
1621,so begin to know what the second book
1622,so forth that show me opportunities to
1623,so get back to sort of the general Greek
1624,so I didn't dress up if Allah is the
1625,so I get some sort of I mean we're sort
1626,so I guess so we've seen a fetus finder
1627,so I knew which was which and when was
1628,so I know exactly which I can go back
1629,so i'm i don't leave tilt so i put in
1630,so knock yours out here yeah see brink
1631,so much of the sort of the professional
1632,so okay so you're just saying you back
1633,so since reign of snakes we got that one
1634,so then I guess overall that if we can
1635,so they don't they don't clutter up or
1636,so yeah so I'm sorry
1637,soilless she puts up just oh I think I'm
1638,some of its going to be repetitive so if
1639,some piece that I might resurrect and
1640,some seem important enough to print off
1641,some sense and even then I might just a
1642,some things for me but mostly no I don't
1643,some through it look for a poem or look
1644,some ways because I mean you know I
1645,someday people keep telling me I should
1646,somehow it seems I mean I never have
1647,somehow yeah it makes every week let you
1648,someone could go through and actually
1649,someone were really interested in were
1650,something but what they're really about
1651,something eventually is going to
1652,something go slide and I just turned
1653,something I didn't quite have the
1654,something I'd been doing all along
1655,something I've seen outside the outside
1656,something not so much the thing as the
1657,something oh yeah I forgot about this
1658,something some phrase or word out of
1659,something sometimes with my mom but most
1660,something that might last but you know
1661,something that once you've said that to
1662,something that you came to realize you
1663,something that you got ahold here yeah I
1664,something that's the supporting eight
1665,sometimes at a kitchen table you never
1666,sometimes it's like we'll have to do
1667,sometimes seemed kind of odd or they'd
1668,sometimes the bulk of the poem and
1669,sometimes those things get so tangled up
1670,somewhat constant in that or like like
1671,somewhere along the line I began to
1672,somewhere around 2000 late 2008 Ott's
1673,somewhere but I would not even remember
1674,somewhere faster or so it seems
1675,somewhere I think they're in a box in
1676,somewhere if people hate you
1677,sonnets I think I've published two in
1678,sonnets right on yeah I mean I've done
1679,sort of circumscribing what the poem is
1680,sort of I have a system and I suppose if
1681,sort of I mean you call much a little
1682,sort of liked the idea that I that the
1683,sort of meant to be more gone through
1684,sort of moving into organizing the
1685,sort of noodle around the way out you
1686,sort of pressing business do you think
1687,sort of questions late you know with
1688,sort of staggering to to try to remember
1689,sort of sticking them to one side yeah
1690,sort of there's something about a tat of
1691,sort of went old-fashioned on myself and
1692,sought out information about methods for
1693,sound it's for me a compositional tool I
1694,sounds fine to me
1695,southern Illinois University at
1696,space he said the desk I said I I
1697,space to write it I had this one or the
1698,space which probably would have been
1699,split the job and each talked to two and
1700,squeeze it see the silence and metal in
1701,stable work that's been published you
1702,start about your writing process
1703,start actively composing and composing
1704,start getting getting movement toward a
1705,start putting words on paper so that's
1706,start using a computer to do these
1707,start where there's like things that it
1708,started and go in for lunch about
1709,started out in Edinburgh in Scotland
1710,started writing down does it like you
1711,Steakhouse hill right over here how 95
1712,step of writing my hand then going to
1713,sticky wicket Hugo like that this
1714,still alive pushing 80 was really kind
1715,still allowed the the word processing
1716,still found a way to make its structure
1717,still got the poems so I can tell me
1718,still I mean I've got almost all the I
1719,still I need to win another prize I
1720,stitch those things together in the
1721,store individual poems for the
1722,storybook thing that happened that I
1723,strangers vets amputees just you know
1724,structure or about its its movement that
1725,students that I'm gonna hate to revise I
1726,studies in American and English
1727,studio the lens that is my eyes an
1728,study what you've done documents like
1729,stuffing what this is telling us yeah
1730,submitting a poll I just sent a poem
1731,substantial electronic presence
1732,substituted sort of mode as well it's a
1733,subtractive and pounding for de creus
1734,success I really don't need to be in any
1735,summary thought or folder which backs up
1736,surprise myself for how to do those
1737,swallowed me and I had to escape from
1738,Swift with the computer than it ever
1739,switch sometimes though I mean you
1740,syllabic line just to just to force me
1741,syllables I like composing say a deck of
1742,syllables more when you're writing it
1743,syllables of the subsequent line just to
1744,take a few photographs document
1745,take the shotgun out and blast out of
1746,take them for about a hundred two
1747,talk about that ago some questions later
1748,talked about having an external hard
1749,talking about how you probably take your
1750,talking about in volume a different
1751,talking talking about poems because some
1752,taught the bridge and you know they both
1753,teacher but a magnificent teacher he
1754,teaching a couple classes for that year
1755,teaching and the sort of advent of the
1756,teaching at LC so I've published ring of
1757,teaching maybe insofar as what I love
1758,techniques class of tried teaching in
1759,techniques or formats that you were able
1760,technology we well it's inescapable at
1761,tell I probably have 250 of these piled
1762,telling me and it'll back and get that
1763,ten it varies depends on what else is
1764,terms of of writing north of living in
1765,test with the computer I mean just
1766,text on the computer which I would then
1767,text to text on the computer screen and
1768,than it is now
1769,than it was now but or maybe it hasn't
1770,that act of laying them out on the floor
1771,that are going to be really really
1772,that are you revising towards like Ida
1773,that box I go through a poem by Palmer
1774,that can allow me to make a stitch here
1775,that computer will automatically do all
1776,that connects those two things so across
1777,that does concern me and then despair I
1778,that for years I started 1995 and and
1779,that I can break so it's it's a that I
1780,that I had a big marble Oh book end at
1781,that I not sort of run the line on too
1782,that I'll look at even at homes of
1783,that in some ways
1784,that in the beginning
1785,that interests me a whole lot more than
1786,that is
1787,that is to say that the period at the
1788,that it's you're guaranteed basically
1789,that just turns on a switch that just
1790,that kind of response to a poll you got
1791,that little sonic wind sprint as I
1792,that part of the process when the
1793,that point in my life or my career as a
1794,that really change anything I don't you
1795,that should make it that much more
1796,that sort of idea changed over years of
1797,that sort of show that process how that
1798,that sort of thing
1799,that stuff for you I don't think that it
1800,that that that part of the technology of
1801,that that that what is now the last poem
1802,that that's either things that have been
1803,that that's that's both the downside
1804,that the Tom was probably confusing or I
1805,that they can they only have to call you
1806,that thing just looking up and watching
1807,that this is
1808,that was in Montana baya they Matylda
1809,that was Kim's idea - I couldn't write
1810,that was one of the great things about
1811,that was really kind of a that I helped
1812,that way but then I don't yeah because I
1813,that whatever sort of disposition I have
1814,that's actually tremendously good advice
1815,that's amazing you know that's good
1816,that's been about it I don't really and
1817,that's here that we'll get to that
1818,that's just a great luxury Seattle yeah
1819,that's just my way of inviting what was
1820,that's just silly why would why would
1821,that's my business file and my personal
1822,that's number one number three and
1823,that's sort of either your main focus or
1824,that's useful and I can build with um
1825,that's when I really got started on it
1826,the
1827,the book because something was missing
1828,the book every one of the publishers
1829,the book if you know what I mean seems
1830,the book is going to be this is how it's
1831,the books and as he said to me and I
1832,the books and reading which was your
1833,the bulk of the composition on the
1834,the class on a kind of lark thinking how
1835,the cloud yeah and and that's it and
1836,the computer and then going back to the
1837,the computer helps to facilitate it
1838,the computer you were using the
1839,the difference between two files as one
1840,the file I'm sure I I one welcome
1841,the first I don't I think I was on
1842,the first little Oh cat pass go over to
1843,the first part of earthly meditations I
1844,the first quatrain ended with a period
1845,the first time I started leaving out the
1846,the handwriting and put things down
1847,the house and they're they're just the
1848,the in process folder that little thesis
1849,the in the screen that becomes success
1850,the individual poems as I find ways to
1851,the internet so I mean it's it's a
1852,the Italian octave I like a BBA a BBA
1853,the law a long sequence of poems called
1854,the life side maybe less so on the
1855,the line is for me separable from what I
1856,the lines were but that also required
1857,the Mac
1858,the Mac to just so I can back things up
1859,the major revisions even here probably
1860,the Master of Fine Arts in which they
1861,the midst of it it's almost like the
1862,the most recent one but they they never
1863,the name of the magazine on it and in
1864,the network is yeah this is a what is
1865,the next thing the next word the next
1866,the oil fields and pipelines in the
1867,the old date goes away so you know I
1868,the only way to submit into New Yorkers
1869,the period which sort of establishes
1870,the pile but they get shuffled because I
1871,the place that's likely to break for
1872,the possibilities of it me being able to
1873,the question that I'm interested in is
1874,the river which I have no memory of
1875,the same as a typewritten I don't
1876,the same thing just wave me on I feel
1877,the security and fixity of your files
1878,the shapes of the letters themselves
1879,the spring in which we'll be we'll be
1880,the technology there are any sort of I
1881,the the first job that I got was down at
1882,the thing in 2002 I couldn't Ethernet
1883,the thing in intercept Cermak what I
1884,the thing that in the drafting process
1885,the time in the tls literary supplement
1886,the tops of compositional spots like
1887,the train oh Jesus no I did Jesus Jesus
1888,the tree I think I got three or four
1889,the tree other way because next year
1890,the typewriter as far as it went
1891,the typewriter so great um yeah so okay
1892,the UK all she did when we were in all
1893,the what the class was called it was an
1894,the whole of course but the assemblage
1895,the whole of the manuscript yes and then
1896,the whole thread of the thing one email
1897,the window that's why I don't know about
1898,the window well it's true I spend a lot
1899,the you're using the computer has given
1900,their papers with but I've got pencils
1901,them are not called dad anymore so but I
1902,them Henry a couple times since but
1903,them on paper yeah
1904,them or Mnet's go in and out yeah which
1905,themselves away from the university
1906,then a fifth envoy sort of the
1907,then add what I'd written longhand on to
1908,then I just got away from that and and
1909,then I'm sort of forced to commit prose
1910,then so that worried me so I had this I
1911,then there's other times there's like
1912,then went to Newcastle or he did good
1913,theoretically it's safe there yeah that
1914,there another years of notebooks and
1915,there are certain things they just got
1916,there are some I
1917,there every ten years so I'll be ancient
1918,there in poems so I don't consider the
1919,there was not email oh yeah oh yeah I
1920,there what might I what might I not have
1921,there you are at home and and you
1922,there's a big big chunk cut and some of
1923,there's a little piece of wood functions
1924,there's a manuscript under a particular
1925,there's a poem called ant and I've got
1926,there's a poem in anatomy and melancholy
1927,there's also sort of substituted
1928,there's no doubt that that for me it's
1929,there's no guarantee that and you know
1930,there's no handwriting there's no
1931,there's so there's no thought being sort
1932,there's some great advantages about
1933,there's the the in the back go all the
1934,these correspondences did we want email
1935,these two poems in there so there's an
1936,they are all books I've pulled down as
1937,they could read about Krane yeah which I
1938,they don't have to make an appointment
1939,they were Dick Hugo and Madeleine trees
1940,they'll be poems in which they're you
1941,they'll say where do you get your ideas
1942,they're all jumbled together I don't
1943,they're also called spring binders and
1944,they're not in any well they are in a
1945,thick of letters from facility that's
1946,thick on her because she written run a
1947,thing and highly musical and then I when
1948,thing and the other thing is that
1949,thing as writing they're they may be
1950,thing on Oh Mike yeah so cellophane so I
1951,thing with individual pieces a lot of
1952,things and then secondly what was there
1953,things are what occurred to me as
1954,things change bummer
1955,things like the reason I keep writing
1956,things that he's he backs everything up
1957,things that might lead me to surprise
1958,things that they said and sort of bind
1959,things they need to consider I never
1960,things we thought was that there were a
1961,things when I want to know that's one of
1962,things where I submitted things accepted
1963,think in the selected poems I use maybe
1964,think is one of the great things about
1965,think it is is one of the great things
1966,think it's bad I don't think it's any
1967,think it's danger it would have been
1968,think it's going to be kind of an
1969,think Kim was part of the part of what
1970,think of like 37 different things I
1971,think that it is if there is a
1972,think that there's something even more
1973,think to compose on a word processor or
1974,think was a great pen so it's a it's a
1975,think your is that your files will be
1976,thinking about in a sort of genesis of a
1977,thinking anyway free living but I do the
1978,thinking there's a poem out here and
1979,third of the way that it goes although
1980,third process being an organizational
1981,this brick look I've got to read from
1982,this down on in a notebook right
1983,this ever stop I think
1984,this is my this is this shirt used to
1985,this is sinister ask a question again I
1986,this kind of chronic chronology there in
1987,this moment was in six quatrains not
1988,this move to a New York house and I
1989,this on TV right just as well
1990,this part of Idaho in the winter there's
1991,this part of the world so I got kind of
1992,this pile of books here on on the futon
1993,this pile of things goes into
1994,this poem and I don't know
1995,this point I can't quite bring myself to
1996,this point I know how it affects the way
1997,this sort of I guess what were your
1998,this stuff is that it allows me to feel
1999,this time Wow well on Cilla Veen
2000,this undeniable hardness of the quatrain
2001,this visual page it's gotta know it's
2002,those boxes out of the closet get the
2003,those data
2004,those email last time I sent poems to
2005,those kinds of things to just to have
2006,those notebooks now it can be a stanza
2007,those off I've got it I think I've got
2008,those poems yeah it's like once that
2009,those required a lot more movement about
2010,those sort of loose on the net and in
2011,those those people I haven't used any of
2012,those who can raise digital natives or
2013,thought to myself what happens if I
2014,three credits that way well I walked
2015,three I got down to like like I would
2016,three okay all right um we should be
2017,three or four or five poems to sin which
2018,three poems and even then I think I
2019,three years old then 96 was the first
2020,throughout oh yeah oh yeah from from
2021,Thursday Wednesday tends to be my campus
2022,tie those poems together and if I write
2023,time and so you went from you were your
2024,time now for 20 years yeah and you know
2025,time rejection was like that's what
2026,time so how long have you been writing
2027,times I'll publish a poem in a magazine
2028,times or is it whenever well it's mostly
2029,title or though now and this has got
2030,to a box but I haven't brought the new
2031,to a poem like that it's the poem called
2032,to be so recorded today oh good yeah
2033,to be supportive and can tell when she
2034,to come out and print off of the whole
2035,to comprise that book because it
2036,to determine where the lines and but
2037,to do Wednesday I'll do Friday but I'd
2038,to find a way to connect the sections
2039,to forget it because she's a prose
2040,to go through the boxes which ultimately
2041,to have it you got a sweet yeah you got
2042,to have that you got to have a
2043,to know about and sometimes beyond they
2044,to leave while you sort of said that's
2045,to me about assisting with arrows and
2046,to me because you lower your standards
2047,to Missoula Montana as I could find and
2048,to my alma mater where I was an adjunct
2049,to not so much to prose and certainly
2050,to save that in some in hardcopy I guess
2051,to shut up
2052,to sort of like in place person kind of
2053,to the boring question there are no
2054,to the computer or I'll get stopped I
2055,to trick myself I know how to uh I know
