start,end,line
0:00:00.000,0:00:09.48,sit in workshop two which is probably

0:00:05.220,0:00:14.63,stupid but then I don't lose my voice by

0:00:09.480,0:00:16.08,the end of the residency well yeah it

0:00:14.639,0:00:17.94,was that was one of the weird things

0:00:16.080,0:00:23.18,that really changed for me when I quit

0:00:17.940,0:00:27.28,teaching full-time was my vocal cords do

0:00:23.189,0:00:30.66,not get the kind of workout they used to

0:00:27.289,0:00:33.93,does that yes I kept thinking why am I

0:00:30.660,0:00:44.52,losing my voice and I got the only thing

0:00:33.930,0:00:56.94,I can figure out us is recording yes ooh

0:00:44.520,0:00:58.82,me me yeah I'm just going to go and then

0:00:56.940,0:01:01.41,the reason I kind of added that was this

0:00:58.829,0:01:02.67,is for DSLR apparently will go for like

0:01:01.410,0:01:04.65,twenty four minutes but then it fills up

0:01:02.670,0:01:07.97,for gigs I'm going to have to get like

0:01:04.650,0:01:16.68,at the restart efficiency so if I forget

0:01:07.979,0:01:19.70,to do that yeah the other one will be

0:01:16.680,0:01:19.70,justice for food

0:01:32.010,0:01:40.45,and so you know I kind of think that the

0:01:37.450,0:01:42.22,interview will be I mean I've really

0:01:40.450,0:01:44.41,pretty familiar right now with your work

0:01:42.220,0:01:46.03,but it's going to focus more on the

0:01:44.410,0:01:47.56,practice so it's not so much like I'm

0:01:46.030,0:01:49.18,not going to prompt you by book cause I

0:01:47.560,0:01:50.38,like kind of imagery or something that

0:01:49.180,0:01:53.71,you were doing certain parts of your

0:01:50.380,0:01:57.84,career but I just want you to kind of go

0:01:53.710,0:02:00.94,and forget whatever we can from that and

0:01:57.840,0:02:02.32,and think about practice and how it's

0:02:00.940,0:02:04.09,changed and all that sort of thing is

0:02:02.320,0:02:06.28,kind of mean that's a real focus but

0:02:04.090,0:02:08.47,anything you think of the time and if

0:02:06.280,0:02:10.09,you repeat yourself the time okay and if

0:02:08.470,0:02:11.50,I'm annoying or if you're definitely

0:02:10.090,0:02:13.84,like down with the questions like okay

0:02:11.500,0:02:16.81,let's go okay I mean you know I'm just

0:10:31.600,0:10:37.96,notebooks kind over yeah they're usually

0:10:33.460,0:10:40.15,with the notebooks are yeah I just once

0:10:37.960,0:10:43.15,I'd print them out I do some final kind

0:10:40.150,0:10:45.19,of tinkering usually like the galleys

0:10:43.150,0:10:46.42,and everything and I'll keep a copy of

0:10:45.190,0:10:49.57,the galleys when the book is actually

0:10:46.420,0:10:53.01,coming out and that gets filed with the

0:10:49.570,0:10:55.99,notebooks then when I'm done with it and

0:10:53.010,0:10:57.64,then the sort of over business and the

0:10:55.990,0:10:59.92,question for me personally am the

0:10:57.640,0:11:02.32,librarian said have you ever received or

0:10:59.920,0:11:04.66,sought out information about methods for

0:11:02.320,0:11:06.76,digital archiving activity for like best

0:11:04.660,0:11:07.81,practices no okay

0:11:06.760,0:11:11.26,and when you'd be interested in

0:11:07.810,0:11:13.14,information about that or you know maybe

0:11:11.260,0:11:17.05,I was thinking about that the other day

0:11:13.140,0:11:21.04,a couple of I was thinking about making

0:11:17.050,0:11:24.85,of a book of selected stories from my

0:11:21.040,0:11:28.36,for books Astoria and realizing that my

0:11:24.850,0:11:31.36,first two books of stories I don't know

0:11:28.360,0:11:34.71,if I can access the computer files of

0:11:31.360,0:11:38.91,them anymore they're they're like on Oh

0:11:34.710,0:11:42.85,floppy disk or zip discorso changes and

0:11:38.910,0:11:44.56,I just I don't know if I could yeah you

0:11:42.850,0:11:47.32,know does that mean I'm going to have to

0:11:44.560,0:11:51.82,retype those suckers or are you usually

0:11:47.320,0:11:55.15,like yeah if I could even find them yeah

0:11:51.820,0:11:59.05,yes yeah there's that because you know

0:11:55.150,0:12:02.01,when we moved out here yeah so that

0:11:59.050,0:12:05.14,would be a major task to locate and

0:12:02.010,0:12:07.00,write so I could probably use some help

0:12:05.140,0:12:08.44,with that okay yeah I know that's and

0:12:07.000,0:12:10.78,that's definitely something that you

0:12:08.440,0:12:12.64,know that that kind of period especially

0:12:10.780,0:12:14.38,the 90s if it's all the different we're

0:12:12.640,0:12:16.36,probably a player and then all the

0:12:14.380,0:12:21.46,different ways of saving them right put

0:12:16.360,0:12:23.50,people in yeah when you do okay so that

0:12:21.460,0:12:24.79,was sort of the quick okay quick

0:12:23.500,0:12:27.21,beginning I'm just going to check this

0:12:24.790,0:12:27.21,is make sure

0:13:00.500,0:13:06.56,okay um that's working so we'll do a set

0:13:04.420,0:13:07.76,so this is going to be more about the

0:13:06.560,0:13:10.82,kind of overview of your writing

0:13:07.760,0:13:12.47,practices and generally and so the sort

0:13:10.820,0:13:14.30,of first couple questions are just sort

0:13:12.470,0:13:15.46,of broad and anything elaborate as much

0:13:14.300,0:13:17.93,there were as little as you'd like but

0:13:15.460,0:13:21.26,so how long have you been writing in a

0:13:17.930,0:13:24.23,more professional capacity and like in a

0:13:21.260,0:13:27.20,way that would sort of I don't know

0:13:24.230,0:13:29.00,feeding you or giving you some sort of I

0:13:27.200,0:13:30.41,mean even even if I can MFA might be a

0:13:29.000,0:13:32.48,kind of professional sort of like when

0:13:30.410,0:13:35.14,you think you started writing kind of

0:13:32.480,0:13:37.55,distant as years as your vocation

0:13:35.140,0:13:39.35,whereas something that led to something

0:13:37.550,0:13:44.72,that would be your vocation describe

0:13:39.350,0:13:48.92,teaching yeah no I I guess since

0:13:44.720,0:13:52.37,graduate school I went to graduate

0:13:48.920,0:13:55.28,school and I thought I would just do

0:13:52.370,0:13:57.08,that for a year that was my plan I would

0:13:55.280,0:13:59.75,go to graduate school and creative

0:13:57.080,0:14:02.30,writing for a year and then I would go

0:13:59.750,0:14:06.89,to medical school I had been a pre-med

0:14:02.300,0:14:09.94,major after college but when I got to

0:14:06.890,0:14:12.47,grad school I was just probably happy

0:14:09.940,0:14:16.04,doing my writing thing and I just I

0:14:12.470,0:14:18.98,never looked back so I just I worked I

0:14:16.040,0:14:21.38,started my so-called practice there

0:14:18.980,0:14:28.37,where I worked every day on my writing

0:14:21.380,0:14:30.38,and roof that was 1975 where was it I

0:14:28.370,0:14:32.81,went to the University Denver University

0:14:30.380,0:14:35.39,Denver I mean was that it one year

0:14:32.810,0:14:39.29,program yeah no I actually stayed the

0:14:35.390,0:14:41.87,regular two years stay - yeah and got

0:14:39.290,0:14:43.55,your anything and then so my uh my next

0:14:41.870,0:14:44.69,question is sort of like I'm interested

0:14:43.550,0:14:46.76,in kind of like how you would describe

0:14:44.690,0:14:48.50,the arc of your career like where you

0:14:46.760,0:14:51.44,went from there and just kind of a

0:14:48.500,0:14:52.76,general okay elaborate or as elaborate

0:14:51.440,0:14:56.84,as you want to be sort of background

0:14:52.760,0:14:59.39,there yeah and from there I taught for I

0:14:56.840,0:15:02.96,got my first teaching job at Marymount

0:14:59.390,0:15:04.97,College of Kansas now defunct okay

0:15:02.960,0:15:07.78,so I taught there for three years and

0:15:04.970,0:15:11.18,then I got a job at Lake Forest College

0:15:07.780,0:15:12.71,just north of Chicago and I cut there

0:15:11.180,0:15:17.06,for eleven years

0:15:12.710,0:15:19.22,and then I came out here in 1990 oh and

0:15:17.060,0:15:22.22,I've been here ever since and you can

0:15:19.220,0:15:25.61,you retired yeah I retired from Eastern

0:15:22.220,0:15:32.14,and oh seven okay but you're continuing

0:15:25.610,0:15:34.39,to teach and at Fermont College so so

0:15:32.149,0:15:36.62,now we're going to get kind of we've

0:15:34.399,0:15:38.24,always been nervous get to the kind of

0:15:36.620,0:15:39.77,specific writing practices sort of

0:15:38.240,0:15:41.69,generally and I have it kind of

0:15:39.770,0:15:44.42,delineated into kind of three stages a

0:15:41.690,0:15:47.18,sort of drafting prewriting notebook

0:15:44.420,0:15:49.60,stage and then a revision stage and then

0:15:47.180,0:15:52.70,a kind of organizational archival stages

0:15:49.600,0:15:54.47,and what I'd like to do is sort of go

0:15:52.700,0:15:55.97,stage by stage and ask you about kind of

0:15:54.470,0:15:58.37,your practices in the beginning and how

0:15:55.970,0:15:59.93,those have changed for each stage but if

0:15:58.370,0:16:02.08,that doesn't make sense to you we can do

0:15:59.930,0:16:05.24,it a different no I said that makes it

0:16:02.089,0:16:08.42,okay so uh I guess I'm I would like to

0:16:05.240,0:16:10.45,first start talking about sort of ways

0:16:08.420,0:16:14.75,you you draft and create your work

0:16:10.459,0:16:16.57,initially so what is your sort of

0:16:14.750,0:16:18.95,typical compositional practice

0:16:16.570,0:16:20.15,especially when you and I'm interested

0:16:18.950,0:16:21.92,right now and kind of like when you

0:16:20.150,0:16:25.49,first started writing how are you

0:16:21.920,0:16:35.24,generating and composing your writing at

0:16:25.490,0:16:39.08,that point so yeah early on I one of the

0:16:35.240,0:16:40.70,things that's different now it has been

0:16:39.080,0:16:46.82,for a long time early on I was probably

0:16:40.700,0:16:49.40,just work on a poem so I would you know

0:16:46.820,0:16:52.88,right I would have a page in my notebook

0:16:49.400,0:16:55.97,or whatever what's the blinds and move

0:16:52.880,0:16:57.62,things around on the page and then I

0:16:55.970,0:17:01.01,would have a another page in the book

0:16:57.620,0:17:05.63,with a different poem but over the years

0:17:01.010,0:17:09.70,I started working on maybe two or three

0:17:05.630,0:17:13.73,palms almost kind of simultaneously on

0:17:09.709,0:17:19.06,the same page which feels kind of nutty

0:17:13.730,0:17:21.16,but I was what I was experiencing that

0:17:19.069,0:17:25.98,kind of led me this way was that a lot

0:17:21.169,0:17:29.94,of times things would be coming to me

0:17:25.980,0:17:31.83,images lines that didn't seem to belong

0:17:29.940,0:17:35.58,to the poem I thought I was working on

0:17:31.830,0:17:40.35,and so I realized that it might be

0:17:35.580,0:17:43.08,helpful to us to not confine myself so

0:17:40.350,0:17:46.35,that's why that was one of the sort of

0:17:43.080,0:17:48.78,main transitions that I've noticed in my

0:17:46.350,0:17:51.96,I think that happened maybe you know

0:17:48.780,0:17:54.39,sort of halfway along okay maybe late

0:17:51.960,0:17:56.73,eighties or so I started experimenting

0:17:54.390,0:17:59.07,with that and I liked it yeah I liked

0:17:56.730,0:18:02.34,having just a page there'd be a poem

0:17:59.070,0:18:04.11,going down one margin and then maybe

0:18:02.340,0:18:06.84,done another margins and across the

0:18:04.110,0:18:10.20,bottom something like that on Island Oh

0:18:06.840,0:18:13.68,on it on one page and then a lot of

0:18:10.200,0:18:17.94,times what would happen is I did I

0:18:13.680,0:18:20.73,didn't like one or two or all three of

0:18:17.940,0:18:22.86,them and eventually maybe just one of

0:18:20.730,0:18:25.89,those poems would kind of gel and then

0:18:22.860,0:18:30.66,get it's all fake okay well I found out

0:18:25.890,0:18:32.76,in the notebook yeah okay and and that

0:18:30.660,0:18:34.38,and then so is that could you put that

0:18:32.760,0:18:39.48,in a certainty book or was that just

0:18:34.380,0:18:41.16,sort of gradual yeah I think I I really

0:18:39.480,0:18:44.64,started experimenting with that was a

0:18:41.160,0:18:46.11,book called beside ourselves just maybe

0:18:44.640,0:18:49.38,kind of in the middle somewhere there

0:18:46.110,0:18:52.53,yeah yeah that was really awesome maybe

0:18:49.380,0:18:55.02,the first book that was more kind of

0:18:52.530,0:18:57.27,deliberate series but yeah like I think

0:18:55.020,0:19:00.21,I can kinda she's letting I can kind of

0:18:57.270,0:19:03.39,figure out where that happened oh yeah

0:19:00.210,0:19:06.06,kind of like yeah and then I liked I

0:19:03.390,0:19:09.60,liked that I liked looking in series so

0:19:06.060,0:19:12.63,much when I was writing that book that I

0:19:09.600,0:19:14.13,also just decided that I wanted to keep

0:19:12.630,0:19:16.65,moving in that direction

0:19:14.130,0:19:18.93,I liked the series pause okay doing

0:19:16.650,0:19:20.70,those yeah yeah and they maybe learn

0:19:18.930,0:19:23.70,some self more to that kind of practice

0:19:20.700,0:19:25.92,with several palms kind of happening at

0:19:23.700,0:19:29.97,the same time in the early draft stages

0:19:25.920,0:19:34.61,yeah and then how is that different tuna

0:19:29.970,0:19:34.61,from your fiction right uh-huh yeah

0:19:35.210,0:19:41.99,I don't really see a lot of similarities

0:19:39.410,0:19:43.79,between writing stories and writing

0:19:41.990,0:19:48.07,poems in terms of the drafting process

0:19:43.790,0:19:53.06,well in terms of space okay

0:19:48.070,0:19:54.08,stories are really different and one of

0:19:53.060,0:19:55.91,the first things they learn about

0:19:54.080,0:20:00.26,writing stories in the drafting process

0:19:55.910,0:20:03.02,was oh it kind of helps to know a few

0:20:00.260,0:20:05.72,things about what's going to happen in

0:20:03.020,0:20:07.55,this story through not unlike a poem

0:20:05.720,0:20:08.71,where you're kind of launching into the

0:20:07.550,0:20:11.87,unknown

0:20:08.710,0:20:15.77,it seems helpful to have like a few

0:20:11.870,0:20:17.35,scenes in mind you know what some of the

0:20:15.770,0:20:19.97,lines of tension

0:20:17.350,0:20:26.12,storylines kind of have a few things

0:20:19.970,0:20:29.54,yeah almost not an outline but I often

0:20:26.120,0:20:31.13,had would writes down four or five kind

0:20:29.540,0:20:33.98,of sentences that would later become

0:20:31.130,0:20:35.81,scenes and that would be like on one

0:20:33.980,0:20:38.36,page of the notebook notebook or you

0:20:35.810,0:20:41.60,know just to scrap a paper in the car on

0:20:38.360,0:20:42.92,driving okay and yeah then you grab

0:20:41.600,0:20:44.66,those cotton paper and put them in the

0:20:42.920,0:20:46.28,notebook cause it become like does it

0:20:44.660,0:20:49.58,accumulate all your sort all that sort

0:20:46.280,0:20:51.26,of detritus of composition now once I

0:20:49.580,0:20:57.38,write the scene I throw the piece of

0:20:51.260,0:21:00.20,paper right yeah all right but the but

0:20:57.380,0:21:03.17,then I my process in making the stories

0:21:00.200,0:21:06.26,would be I write like I try to write a

0:21:03.170,0:21:10.40,scene a day or so in the initial

0:21:06.260,0:21:12.65,drafting phase and I just try to stay

0:21:10.400,0:21:14.66,with that scene and you know blow out

0:21:12.650,0:21:17.57,the edges often it's like three times as

0:21:14.660,0:21:22.25,long as what's going to actually be in

0:21:17.570,0:21:24.47,the final story okay usually I'm

0:21:22.250,0:21:26.96,compressing compressing compressing but

0:21:24.470,0:21:28.37,initially I just trying to look around

0:21:26.960,0:21:33.38,and see what's happening in the

0:21:28.370,0:21:35.90,periphery and just sort of stain once

0:21:33.380,0:21:37.64,one scene at a time and I don't worry

0:21:35.900,0:21:41.42,about the order I'm not writing the

0:21:37.640,0:21:43.16,first scene first I often write start

0:21:41.420,0:21:45.59,with the middle scene in fact I kind

0:21:43.160,0:21:47.46,know I'm writing the middle scene and

0:21:45.590,0:21:51.69,then I just I move

0:21:47.460,0:21:54.12,in the chronology of the story I because

0:21:51.690,0:21:55.98,I you know I have my little list and

0:21:54.120,0:21:57.57,often when I'm working on one scene I'll

0:21:55.980,0:21:59.13,think of another sin and I just write it

0:21:57.570,0:22:02.28,on another piece of paper like just

0:21:59.130,0:22:05.07,again a sentence settles kind of comment

0:22:02.280,0:22:08.82,yeah so I don't forget Oh what's up see

0:22:05.070,0:22:11.28,on this but so it's they're very the

0:22:08.820,0:22:13.80,process is really different it takes me

0:22:11.280,0:22:16.53,I like when a story is happening when

0:22:13.800,0:22:18.48,I'm getting that early draft comes

0:22:16.530,0:22:23.61,really fast I hate it I hate it I hate

0:22:18.480,0:22:26.55,it because it takes all my time I have

0:22:23.610,0:22:29.41,been known to cancel classes I'm sick

0:22:26.550,0:22:32.24,today sorry I can't come in today

0:22:29.410,0:22:35.61,[Laughter]

0:22:32.240,0:22:37.74,because I feel like I'm going to lose it

0:22:35.610,0:22:40.08,okay so I when you said it it's

0:22:37.740,0:22:42.00,happening it feels like like it's come

0:22:40.080,0:22:43.49,to you it's like I mean it's not like an

0:22:42.000,0:22:48.42,inspiration but it's just like

0:22:43.490,0:22:50.94,accumulation or so much is going on you

0:22:48.420,0:22:53.10,know I go out and I take a walk every

0:22:50.940,0:22:54.72,afternoon this apartment we actually

0:22:53.100,0:22:58.92,part my writing process to take a walk

0:22:54.720,0:23:01.86,in the afternoon and shut up I'm just

0:22:58.920,0:23:06.90,trying to walk the people are talking in

0:23:01.860,0:23:09.27,my head and so it's just it feels like

0:23:06.900,0:23:11.31,it's just kind of sits over powering

0:23:09.270,0:23:14.91,saying when I'm working on a story it

0:23:11.310,0:23:16.89,just comes over me and it wakes me up in

0:23:14.910,0:23:19.74,the morning people wake me up in the

0:23:16.890,0:23:22.37,morning they are chattering away is it

0:23:19.740,0:23:27.75,it's very unnerving

0:23:22.370,0:23:30.75,and I often push back at a story until I

0:23:27.750,0:23:32.82,am really sure that I have you know

0:23:30.750,0:23:36.12,quite a few of the building blocks in

0:23:32.820,0:23:38.70,place because otherwise it it just seems

0:23:36.120,0:23:41.46,like a struggle in a fight and it's

0:23:38.700,0:23:43.80,going to occupy it takes it takes me

0:23:41.460,0:23:48.21,about ten days of like ten hour days in

0:23:43.800,0:23:50.82,a row ten ten-hour day well it's for one

0:23:48.210,0:23:53.97,story for a story and this is all

0:23:50.820,0:23:58.17,hundred into yeah okay and it's just

0:23:53.970,0:24:00.14,incredible no I mean I'm I guess you're

0:23:58.170,0:24:04.07,saving a minute yeah I'm down

0:24:00.140,0:24:08.32,yeah but not with the hands with the

0:24:04.070,0:24:11.02,brains and then you know it's so much

0:24:08.320,0:24:13.52,because I don't I don't know how other

0:24:11.020,0:24:15.20,writers do this because I'm not writing

0:24:13.520,0:24:18.28,the scenes in order I'm kind of

0:24:15.200,0:24:21.11,deliberately writing them out of order

0:24:18.280,0:24:24.29,just I write the scene I see most

0:24:21.110,0:24:27.08,clearly in my mind first and not worry

0:24:24.290,0:24:29.24,about where it's going to go then then I

0:24:27.080,0:24:33.35,just put the whole thing away for a long

0:24:29.240,0:24:35.69,time that initial mess of a draft and

0:24:33.350,0:24:37.70,then worry later about kind of arranging

0:24:35.690,0:24:42.77,the scenes I'm often moving things

0:24:37.700,0:24:46.91,around not based on when they happened

0:24:42.770,0:24:48.62,but what's more interesting to come next

0:24:46.910,0:24:52.30,okay

0:24:48.620,0:24:54.16,and so when were you studying fiction as

0:24:52.309,0:24:56.36,well as poetry in your graduate school

0:24:54.169,0:25:00.35,or did when did you start to write these

0:24:56.360,0:25:02.75,stories well I was um I did take a

0:25:00.350,0:25:06.14,fiction writing class in grad school I

0:25:02.750,0:25:07.94,was in I was in the poetry group but we

0:25:06.140,0:25:11.99,had to take a fiction class and I was

0:25:07.940,0:25:13.76,terrible I was terrible at it because I

0:25:11.990,0:25:18.10,didn't have any sense of what made a

0:25:13.760,0:25:20.48,story yeah but when I started teaching

0:25:18.100,0:25:23.99,it's especially when I moved to Lake

0:25:20.480,0:25:26.41,Forest College I they thought well any

0:25:23.990,0:25:29.90,poet can teach fiction writing you know

0:25:26.419,0:25:31.46,it's debatable if we can get a fiction

0:25:29.900,0:25:34.28,writer who can teach poetry so they

0:25:31.460,0:25:37.39,hired thinking you know that I could

0:25:34.280,0:25:40.82,figure it out so I think I just

0:25:37.390,0:25:43.42,accidentally taught myself to write

0:25:40.820,0:25:46.28,fiction by trying to help my students

0:25:43.429,0:25:50.03,make their stories better and trying to

0:25:46.280,0:25:55.22,diagnose and what does this story need I

0:25:50.030,0:25:57.23,remember so many days walking to my

0:25:55.220,0:25:58.88,fiction writing class and trying to

0:25:57.230,0:26:02.03,think about what I was going to say to

0:25:58.880,0:26:04.46,this writer about her story you know how

0:26:02.030,0:26:08.54,to how to address its trouble

0:26:04.460,0:26:12.88,and I realized that I was internalizing

0:26:08.540,0:26:15.91,all of all this and then the first

0:26:12.880,0:26:19.42,time I got a sabbatical on I remember I

0:26:15.910,0:26:21.13,was driving into Chicago on a little for

0:26:19.420,0:26:23.17,a little adventure for the day and I'm

0:26:21.130,0:26:25.66,so happy I had the sabbatical I was

0:26:23.170,0:26:29.59,going to work on poems of course and I

0:26:25.660,0:26:32.08,got this idea for a story and I wrote I

0:26:29.590,0:26:32.92,remember I was just writing on my car

0:26:32.080,0:26:35.61,see fine

0:26:32.920,0:26:38.44,driving this this little note to myself

0:26:35.610,0:26:40.66,about what the story kind of just a

0:26:38.440,0:26:43.54,synopsis like one sentence of what it

0:26:40.660,0:26:48.67,would be by the time I got into Chicago

0:26:43.540,0:26:50.89,I had five story synopses written on

0:26:48.670,0:26:52.96,this piece of paper well and then I just

0:26:50.890,0:26:56.11,came home and that's when I did from my

0:26:52.960,0:26:58.96,own radical I will I will a bunch of

0:26:56.110,0:27:01.95,stories analysis first book of stories

0:26:58.960,0:27:06.73,limited lifetime warranty is called yeah

0:27:01.950,0:27:14.59,and what year was it oh my gosh I think

0:27:06.730,0:27:15.01,that was 1983 yourself and so so

0:27:14.590,0:27:18.40,southern

0:27:15.010,0:27:19.72,Anna's and so you've been stories kind

0:27:18.400,0:27:21.64,of happened to you and they've done

0:27:19.720,0:27:25.27,they've been similar as a whole time in

0:27:21.640,0:27:27.25,writing have poems in similar ways had

0:27:25.270,0:27:29.32,like kind of come upon you or is it a

0:27:27.250,0:27:31.69,little bit more I don't know is it a

0:27:29.320,0:27:34.93,different process than that holes are

0:27:31.690,0:27:42.16,more like a daily practice with me I

0:27:34.930,0:27:48.18,like I like poems they don't form either

0:27:42.160,0:27:51.40,more about sound and imagery voice who's

0:27:48.180,0:27:58.00,talking in my poems there's there often

0:27:51.400,0:28:03.46,some part of me that I didn't really

0:27:58.000,0:28:06.15,know was there you know some aspect of

0:28:03.460,0:28:09.13,personality that I'm kind of exploring

0:28:06.150,0:28:12.69,yeah who uses language a different way

0:28:09.130,0:28:17.11,maybe than my ordinary daily life self

0:28:12.690,0:28:22.54,so I like I like that kind of quick pop

0:28:17.110,0:28:24.73,of a poem and you start mostly with the

0:28:22.540,0:28:32.33,line or name

0:28:24.730,0:28:36.77,I like a line with an image in it okay I

0:28:32.330,0:28:39.35,like one time I was writing an article

0:28:36.770,0:28:42.08,about Charles writes poetry I really

0:28:39.350,0:28:44.51,like Charles Wright and I said something

0:28:42.080,0:28:49.25,in there and yes with you about the hand

0:28:44.510,0:28:52.54,of the image in the glove of sound and I

0:28:49.250,0:28:54.16,took that out over the review because I

0:28:52.549,0:28:57.28,thought it sound a little precious or

0:28:54.169,0:29:00.47,something but it reduces yeah

0:28:57.289,0:29:03.64,but for me I like that kind of fear sort

0:29:00.470,0:29:11.92,of in sort of indivisible great right

0:29:03.649,0:29:14.45,they come together but I'm I'm I

0:29:11.929,0:29:16.97,remember talking to Charles one time and

0:29:14.450,0:29:19.85,I asked him a lot of the same questions

0:29:16.970,0:29:22.13,you're asking me about composition I was

0:29:19.850,0:29:24.86,just like taken aback to the airport

0:29:22.130,0:29:26.48,after a reading I like plug in him for

0:29:24.860,0:29:28.39,everything you can tell me about how he

0:29:26.480,0:29:31.85,works and he says well you know after I

0:29:28.399,0:29:37.52,do it to your fourth draft and I I turn

0:29:31.850,0:29:39.67,it over to my ear yeah he said I drive

0:29:37.520,0:29:42.28,around town doing errands going to

0:29:39.679,0:29:44.65,stores stuff like that and I memorized

0:29:42.289,0:29:47.51,the poem and working on and then I just

0:29:44.659,0:29:50.39,start moving the words in the lines

0:29:47.510,0:29:52.37,around and then I start moving the lines

0:29:50.390,0:29:54.50,and the stances around just kind of

0:29:52.370,0:30:00.20,trying out I'm listening to the sonic

0:29:54.500,0:30:02.63,value I'm doing that so I guess that's a

0:30:00.200,0:30:04.49,good space to move on to review I mean

0:30:02.630,0:30:08.99,so when you're revising a poem are you

0:30:04.490,0:30:11.09,revising mostly by sound or I mean it's

0:30:08.990,0:30:17.21,like the sonic values is that where are

0:30:11.090,0:30:20.11,there different stages well you know

0:30:17.210,0:30:25.88,every poem has just presents different

0:30:20.110,0:30:27.89,troubles to me I guess these are some of

0:30:25.880,0:30:29.53,the questions I have to ask myself if

0:30:27.890,0:30:31.07,this is just for me I don't know that

0:30:29.539,0:30:34.97,these would be other people's problems

0:30:31.070,0:30:36.32,by any means but I'm asking myself who

0:30:34.970,0:30:41.01,the heck is talking

0:30:36.320,0:30:44.94,who is it because sometimes I just and I

0:30:41.010,0:30:48.45,mean that in a physical literal way I

0:30:44.940,0:30:51.54,have to see I have to see a figure

0:30:48.450,0:30:53.88,almost you know maybe it's me but it's

0:30:51.540,0:30:58.11,me when I'm 1,
0:30:53.880,0:31:01.77,it's me with big red hair it's another

0:30:58.110,0:31:02.46,so I'm asking who is this person where

0:31:01.770,0:31:08.64,is she

0:31:02.460,0:31:12.96,are he sometimes I think I'm in a kind

0:31:08.640,0:31:15.27,of gender shift I like that because I

0:31:12.960,0:31:17.40,was a real tomboy as a little kid and I

0:31:15.270,0:31:19.80,think I kind of squashed that little

0:31:17.400,0:31:21.33,tomboy down and he likes to come back

0:31:19.800,0:31:24.12,and say things once in a while and he's

0:31:21.330,0:31:32.28,a little bit of a sassy smadi kid and I

0:31:24.120,0:31:36.36,like him so who is she where are we in

0:31:32.280,0:31:38.30,the poem I need to get located in

0:31:36.360,0:31:43.94,time-space

0:31:38.300,0:31:47.43,and what the heck is going on like what

0:31:43.940,0:31:50.25,dramatically is happening in the poem

0:31:47.430,0:31:52.56,and a lot of times I'm you know I'll

0:31:50.250,0:31:57.93,have a fix on one or the other of these

0:31:52.560,0:31:59.76,questions but I'm really feeling unclear

0:31:57.930,0:32:02.79,about the other so I kind of know

0:31:59.760,0:32:05.24,questions to ask myself and that's what

0:32:02.790,0:32:07.68,I do in there really early stages of

0:32:05.240,0:32:10.77,drafting the poem and trying to figure

0:32:07.680,0:32:12.51,out the answers to some of those and how

0:32:10.770,0:32:14.21,do these questions then translate into

0:32:12.510,0:32:15.90,like into the basic physical

0:32:14.210,0:32:17.55,manifestation of your writing are you

0:32:15.900,0:32:20.55,are you still in your notebooks working

0:32:17.550,0:32:23.01,yeah okay yeah fill in notebooks and are

0:32:20.550,0:32:25.41,you writing these questions in no now

0:32:23.010,0:32:29.37,I'm just what I'm doing is I'm just

0:32:25.410,0:32:32.46,getting my imagination a chore a task

0:32:29.370,0:32:34.68,instead I'm staring into space and

0:32:32.460,0:32:38.66,trying to see like where's the set where

0:32:34.680,0:32:40.65,is this unfolding trying to give myself

0:32:38.660,0:32:42.33,I'm so I'm interested in all this

0:32:40.650,0:32:44.64,material and I remember let's say you're

0:32:42.330,0:32:46.68,a poet but I mean it's also like you

0:32:44.640,0:32:48.72,knows it so you haven't so much up here

0:32:46.680,0:32:49.04,just that it doesn't happen on on the

0:32:48.720,0:32:50.63,page

0:32:49.049,0:32:52.88,doesn't happen it happens a lot yeah

0:32:50.639,0:32:54.45,going to the store and thinking about

0:32:52.889,0:32:57.98,for listening to me of your own sound

0:32:54.450,0:33:02.42,this is another hard things dr. Porter

0:32:57.980,0:33:04.32,yeah and see none of this takes place

0:33:02.429,0:33:07.04,with fictional fiction you're sort of

0:33:04.320,0:33:10.47,that you've got all that as you walk

0:33:07.049,0:33:12.17,into the first thing great great well

0:33:10.470,0:33:14.46,then so so what is your mode when you're

0:33:12.179,0:33:16.75,advising a story like how do you how do

0:33:14.460,0:33:21.23,you work through the drafts of the story

0:33:16.759,0:33:24.89,well with a story I'm really thinking a

0:33:21.239,0:33:28.87,lot more about why does this happen or

0:33:24.899,0:33:30.98,why did this happen in the past tense

0:33:28.879,0:33:31.35,actually have a lot of questions

0:33:30.989,0:33:35.36,thoughts

0:33:31.350,0:33:37.37,motivations of the characters or what

0:33:35.369,0:33:40.32,their relationships are like how did

0:33:37.379,0:33:42.45,they get to this I'm often trying to

0:33:40.320,0:33:46.25,think about a little some details of

0:33:42.450,0:33:50.09,backstory you know again you know all

0:33:46.259,0:33:52.83,these things it's really helped to have

0:33:50.090,0:33:55.54,heard myself ask my students these

0:33:52.830,0:33:59.27,questions for the last 30 years yeah

0:33:55.549,0:34:03.33,they're kind of in there this is yeah

0:33:59.279,0:34:07.59,the questions to ask yourself and but I

0:34:03.330,0:34:10.64,think what I'm mainly doing once I have

0:34:07.590,0:34:13.70,addressed some of these questions I mean

0:34:10.649,0:34:17.87,we have to do with inferiority and

0:34:13.700,0:34:21.00,psychology of people is in revision I'm

0:34:17.879,0:34:23.90,just trying to get the story to move

0:34:21.000,0:34:28.13,along I'm really paying most attention

0:34:23.909,0:34:31.04,to the pace and I think in that regard

0:34:28.139,0:34:34.98,now poetry and fiction maybe have a

0:34:31.049,0:34:37.88,little more similarities when you get to

0:34:34.980,0:34:40.29,that stage of revision where you're

0:34:37.889,0:34:42.29,starting to really start to tighten yeah

0:34:40.290,0:34:46.66,are we there now what that was talking

0:34:42.299,0:34:53.25,about no yes okay your bands so then

0:34:46.669,0:34:57.96,with the poem I flash mercilessly I'm a

0:34:53.250,0:34:59.81,slasher yes and I move things around but

0:34:57.960,0:35:02.97,often when I'm moving around is you know

0:34:59.819,0:35:06.34,I've got too many lines on

0:35:02.970,0:35:09.01,the landscape all in a row here I've got

0:35:06.340,0:35:11.71,ten lines about a freaking place where

0:35:09.010,0:35:13.93,we are the best boring but I sometimes I

0:35:11.710,0:35:16.42,won't cut them I'll just take four of

0:35:13.930,0:35:18.87,them and put them in a different place

0:35:16.420,0:35:22.21,and I don't worry too much about like

0:35:18.870,0:35:25.60,how to get back there because that's

0:35:22.210,0:35:27.46,easy to do later and same in fiction

0:35:25.600,0:35:30.90,what I'm really thinking about pacing

0:35:27.460,0:35:34.44,I'm thinking about you know like the

0:35:30.900,0:35:38.05,opening of the story I'll just start

0:35:34.440,0:35:40.60,with the scene that we're going to catch

0:35:38.050,0:35:41.98,back up to in the middle but because

0:35:40.600,0:35:43.45,it's got some interest I think

0:35:41.980,0:35:44.80,interesting dialogue or something

0:35:43.450,0:35:47.02,interesting is going on with the

0:35:44.800,0:35:50.08,characters I'm going to start there and

0:35:47.020,0:35:52.63,then circle back and then catch back up

0:35:50.080,0:35:54.28,to it midway through the story oh and

0:35:52.630,0:35:57.73,you're for that same cut that's typical

0:35:54.280,0:35:59.23,for me to UM move around like that so

0:35:57.730,0:36:01.75,I'm just going okay we've got a scene a

0:35:59.230,0:36:03.61,dialogue now we're going to have you

0:36:01.750,0:36:06.28,know how to dissolve start now we're

0:36:03.610,0:36:08.44,going to have scene where we've got some

0:36:06.280,0:36:10.83,dream or some thinking that we're going

0:36:08.440,0:36:17.41,to go back to dialog so I'm just kind of

0:36:10.830,0:36:19.03,having some syncopation of pacing things

0:36:17.410,0:36:20.53,and that kind of happens throughout your

0:36:19.030,0:36:22.03,books to write not if not only within

0:36:20.530,0:36:25.38,the story hood within a collection of

0:36:22.030,0:36:25.38,stories there's sort of that same

0:36:25.980,0:36:30.52,disadvantages of such as it seems or not

0:36:29.020,0:36:33.19,not repetition but like a kind of

0:36:30.520,0:36:34.75,allusion to the same places and time and

0:36:33.190,0:36:37.03,space

0:36:34.750,0:36:38.59,so I guess is that when you are when

0:36:37.030,0:36:40.30,you're revising the entire book is that

0:36:38.590,0:36:42.85,when you're putting together the book

0:36:40.300,0:36:47.53,itself is that also happening yeah okay

0:36:42.850,0:36:53.86,okay so have these two modes of revision

0:36:47.530,0:36:55.84,that sort of focus on pacing and moving

0:36:53.860,0:36:57.76,around any changes how they changed over

0:36:55.840,0:36:58.96,the course of your career I mean did you

0:36:57.760,0:37:00.91,like when you were first starting out

0:36:58.960,0:37:03.76,writing did you have to come to this

0:37:00.910,0:37:07.24,kind of way of revising or it did just

0:37:03.760,0:37:12.01,what was it there from the beginning no

0:37:07.240,0:37:13.84,it's been a slow gradual process in the

0:37:12.010,0:37:14.18,beginning was was there a different kind

0:37:13.840,0:37:16.55,of way

0:37:14.180,0:37:19.70,more you know we're doing it more

0:37:16.550,0:37:23.48,by-the-book kind of speaker was it oh

0:37:19.700,0:37:25.40,gosh I don't I don't know how I was

0:37:23.480,0:37:27.86,doing anything at the beginning I know

0:37:25.400,0:37:28.85,you know what my first book of poems I

0:37:27.860,0:37:33.11,had help

0:37:28.850,0:37:35.15,I've never had an editor again yeah like

0:37:33.110,0:37:36.89,I had with that very first book Larry

0:37:35.150,0:37:38.39,Lieberman at University of Illinois

0:37:36.890,0:37:41.45,press

0:37:38.390,0:37:44.93,he weeded out some of the weaker poems

0:37:41.450,0:37:47.83,but also helped me to shape up some new

0:37:44.930,0:37:50.75,things I was working on and put them in

0:37:47.830,0:37:52.52,help me with the arrangement and you

0:37:50.750,0:37:55.10,know I've never had help like that again

0:37:52.520,0:37:58.34,but that was very instructive yeah Kimmy

0:37:55.100,0:38:00.83,yeah he would write me these interesting

0:37:58.340,0:38:02.69,little letters were you explained you

0:38:00.830,0:38:05.30,know why he thought this article here

0:38:02.690,0:38:09.38,and this go there and this stanza needed

0:38:05.300,0:38:11.51,to be gone this was stupid it was just

0:38:09.380,0:38:13.64,so helpful to have somebody be such a

0:38:11.510,0:38:16.37,close reader with the scene I said if

0:38:13.640,0:38:18.41,you ever had them again ever so so do

0:38:16.370,0:38:19.79,people play a role in your revision

0:38:18.410,0:38:22.97,process now or is it pretty much just

0:38:19.790,0:38:25.19,you um well my husband reads everything

0:38:22.970,0:38:29.27,and he's really really tough critic

0:38:25.190,0:38:35.09,really really tough it's very good but

0:38:29.270,0:38:39.23,he I think he's smart reader and he also

0:38:35.090,0:38:42.77,kind of knows what I'm capable of and if

0:38:39.230,0:38:46.52,I don't measure up he'll tell me yes

0:38:42.770,0:38:50.59,yeah so you don't all right you're not

0:38:46.520,0:38:54.59,corresponding with other writers I have

0:38:50.590,0:38:59.68,I have a couple of good fiction writer

0:38:54.590,0:39:03.76,friends that I have shared work with and

0:38:59.680,0:39:07.34,another a novel I had a two book

0:39:03.760,0:39:09.74,contract this is the book of stories

0:39:07.340,0:39:12.38,before this one and they wanted the

0:39:09.740,0:39:13.61,second thing to be a novel the publisher

0:39:12.380,0:39:16.67,I told you who decided they were going

0:39:13.610,0:39:19.07,to quit this is fiction and they wanted

0:39:16.670,0:39:22.39,the second book to be a novel so I I

0:39:19.070,0:39:26.69,tried three times to write a novel and I

0:39:22.390,0:39:29.45,got two hundred pages in three times

0:39:26.690,0:39:32.24,yeah and I showed a couple of those

0:39:29.450,0:39:37.46,books to friends who are fiction writers

0:39:32.240,0:39:39.14,and they they confirmed for me that what

0:39:37.460,0:39:42.14,I thought was true the way I could

0:39:39.140,0:39:47.54,phrase it to myself is they didn't have

0:39:42.140,0:39:52.85,a big enough engine I like a short story

0:39:47.540,0:39:56.08,I'm I like to go cut I like short

0:39:52.850,0:39:58.82,stories - I was struck though in quake

0:39:56.080,0:40:00.05,right but like I was I was reading that

0:39:58.820,0:40:02.57,and I thought it was I mean it read to

0:40:00.050,0:40:05.00,me and helps me a lot like the way that

0:40:02.570,0:40:06.77,Jennifer Egan is explaining we do love

0:40:05.000,0:40:09.08,working out in like separate stories but

0:40:06.770,0:40:12.20,all kind of like it's an investigating

0:40:09.080,0:40:13.70,certain kind of dilemmas and an

0:40:12.200,0:40:17.45,interesting kind of metaphorical

0:40:13.700,0:40:19.70,noticeable is well thank you I was that

0:40:17.450,0:40:21.02,good positive yes yeah with that but I

0:40:19.700,0:40:22.31,was like I mean like what did she call

0:40:21.020,0:40:24.74,this or not I mean I just was wondering

0:40:22.310,0:40:26.60,you know it's not anyway it's just such

0:40:24.740,0:40:29.42,a there's very arbitrary but I think I

0:40:26.600,0:40:31.07,can compose them very much separately

0:40:29.420,0:40:33.35,I mean that they are related right and

0:40:31.070,0:40:35.84,amazing yeah they're weak stories yeah

0:40:33.350,0:40:38.15,they've all been linked yes I really I

0:40:35.840,0:40:42.35,love all the different possibilities of

0:40:38.150,0:40:46.01,ways to link stories but in terms of the

0:40:42.350,0:40:49.28,engine yeah I like a little small engine

0:40:46.010,0:40:53.60,that I feel like I can I can fix what's

0:40:49.280,0:40:56.57,wrong with a little small engine and I

0:40:53.600,0:40:59.15,don't know if I could the novel thing

0:40:56.570,0:41:02.87,it's kind of overwhelming for me to

0:40:59.150,0:41:05.42,think about yeah how much you have to

0:41:02.870,0:41:09.29,sustain how much should have how much

0:41:05.420,0:41:11.99,needs to drive a big novel and I love

0:41:09.290,0:41:17.18,novels I was really none but I'm

0:41:11.990,0:41:19.55,intimidated by the arc how huge it needs

0:41:17.180,0:41:25.36,to be and how much maybe you need to

0:41:19.550,0:41:28.22,know before you sit down right there

0:41:25.360,0:41:29.60,writing a tale any sort of research or

0:41:28.220,0:41:32.27,circle or otherwise

0:41:29.600,0:41:34.37,yeah like quake was a good example I

0:41:32.270,0:41:36.41,love doing all that research on the

0:41:34.370,0:41:38.33,gypsy culture in the country I just

0:41:36.410,0:41:40.73,loved it oh yeah

0:41:38.339,0:41:42.53,and that just really fed my story so I

0:41:40.739,0:41:45.59,was looking on it and there's new books

0:41:42.539,0:41:48.56,that has a dinosaur dig in it that was

0:41:45.599,0:41:52.22,really fun meet my husband I went on the

0:41:48.569,0:41:54.39,dig in Montana as part of the research

0:41:52.229,0:41:57.26,for that fun made especially they just

0:41:54.390,0:41:58.85,have that like dinosaur versus dinosaur

0:41:57.269,0:42:00.66,discovery or something this summer could

0:41:58.859,0:42:02.78,you see this formed with like some

0:42:00.660,0:42:07.31,private invest in private digger found

0:42:02.789,0:42:09.26,these like perfectly preserved fossils

0:42:07.319,0:42:11.03,of like a Tyrannosaurus Rex worth like a

0:42:09.269,0:42:12.50,Stegosaurus like right next to

0:42:11.039,0:42:14.81,tremendous oh that that you made fight

0:42:12.509,0:42:16.58,and so they stole it and like I said wow

0:42:14.819,0:42:18.68,there's only big folded adoption for

0:42:16.589,0:42:20.81,some ridiculous price really sort of the

0:42:18.689,0:42:22.82,debate about this just like a couple of

0:42:20.819,0:42:26.09,Famers or something a couple of like

0:42:22.829,0:42:29.09,hold the whole week creatures Wow didn't

0:42:26.099,0:42:32.33,sleep and insane fine in Montana you

0:42:29.099,0:42:34.41,know and that's right well what I

0:42:32.339,0:42:37.38,understood was that on this is

0:42:34.410,0:42:42.26,interesting but what I heard was um

0:42:37.380,0:42:45.28,all those glacial floods what happened

0:42:42.269,0:42:48.32,and they basically wash all these bones

0:42:45.289,0:42:50.78,over and fall there be like this giant

0:42:48.329,0:42:53.03,phone bed of you know 20 different

0:42:50.789,0:42:55.49,species but just because they've been

0:42:53.039,0:43:03.46,washed by the floods like that yeah up

0:42:55.499,0:43:06.83,the same place I just read those words I

0:43:03.469,0:43:09.35,guess then what a couple more questions

0:43:06.839,0:43:11.03,what revision but some and then so I

0:43:09.359,0:43:12.53,guess one of the like I've been reading

0:43:11.039,0:43:14.00,this book called the work of revision

0:43:12.539,0:43:15.39,which is a really interesting book kind

0:43:14.009,0:43:16.94,of tracing the history of revision so

0:43:15.390,0:43:19.43,much romantics up through the modernist

0:43:16.949,0:43:23.36,period and then kind of how textual

0:43:19.439,0:43:24.68,critisism works with it but and she was

0:43:23.369,0:43:26.36,sort of earnings Hannah Sullivan wrote

0:43:24.689,0:43:29.45,and she was sort of delineating kind of

0:43:26.369,0:43:30.71,three modes of vision one being a

0:43:29.459,0:43:32.36,creative like

0:43:30.719,0:43:34.14,joyce adding all the stuff Pacifica and

0:43:32.369,0:43:38.18,the other parts of the other season it's

0:43:34.140,0:43:39.50,the sort of excitable subtractive way

0:43:38.189,0:43:41.57,that you seem to do and then there's

0:43:39.509,0:43:43.28,that sort of substitution and I'm

0:43:41.579,0:43:45.23,wondering if their primary mode between

0:43:43.289,0:43:46.77,those three that you use for your

0:43:45.239,0:43:52.96,revision or is

0:43:46.770,0:43:57.94,combination hmm I would say I I really

0:43:52.960,0:44:01.69,kind of start with the excretion first

0:43:57.940,0:44:05.20,yeah and then go into the subtraction

0:44:01.690,0:44:07.11,and then probably this substitution it's

0:44:05.200,0:44:10.45,like the pink ring I do at the very end

0:44:07.119,0:44:12.46,okay and physically where where do these

0:44:10.450,0:44:14.29,processes happen I mean like you're

0:44:12.460,0:44:16.84,taking this way by having in the

0:44:14.290,0:44:19.50,notebook what does that happen on the

0:44:16.840,0:44:25.27,computer or that happen in those spaces

0:44:19.500,0:44:28.86,usually I've excised much of what I was

0:44:25.270,0:44:30.70,going to take out before I type it up so

0:44:28.869,0:44:34.24,I probably as I said I'll probably do

0:44:30.700,0:44:37.21,two or three handwritten drafts and I'll

0:44:34.240,0:44:40.36,rip actually rip the notebook page out

0:44:37.210,0:44:42.40,or and I have snow books and notebooks

0:44:40.360,0:44:45.70,where I I have a big X through the page

0:44:42.400,0:44:47.68,to so that I do not get confused that

0:44:45.700,0:44:50.20,I'm actually done with this version now

0:44:47.680,0:44:52.03,there's a if I look hard enough in the

0:44:50.200,0:44:55.06,notebook there is a later version of the

0:44:52.030,0:44:56.65,pause but I so I throw the old ripped

0:44:55.060,0:45:00.46,out pages in the back of the notebook

0:44:56.650,0:45:04.65,and there's a newer version somewhere in

0:45:00.460,0:45:07.66,there but the older ones are fatter and

0:45:04.650,0:45:10.99,often I'm awful you know experimenting

0:45:07.660,0:45:16.99,with line breaks than to you know what's

0:45:10.990,0:45:18.88,the shape shaping issues and and so just

0:45:16.990,0:45:21.43,to confirm that you're doing that in the

0:45:18.880,0:45:23.95,notebook and then I'll book still so and

0:45:21.430,0:45:26.80,then I feel like when I move it to the

0:45:23.950,0:45:29.20,computer I'm sort of getting to a place

0:45:26.800,0:45:30.60,where I want to look at it there's

0:45:29.200,0:45:32.70,something I'm sure you're going to hear

0:45:30.609,0:45:35.74,this with lots of writers my age that

0:45:32.700,0:45:39.99,there's something about when you type it

0:45:35.740,0:45:44.10,up that starts to make it look and

0:45:39.990,0:45:49.48,permanent especially for me in terms of

0:45:44.109,0:45:55.27,the shape of the poem the the line

0:45:49.480,0:45:57.43,length especially in a poem I am less

0:45:55.270,0:46:00.04,inclined to fiddle with line lengths

0:45:57.430,0:46:03.52,once I've got it on the

0:46:00.040,0:46:05.41,on the computer I do that is but for

0:46:03.520,0:46:07.57,some reason it still feels easier for me

0:46:05.410,0:46:11.92,to do it on the page could like to stick

0:46:07.570,0:46:13.99,my slashes in there okay and so once

0:46:11.920,0:46:17.10,they're actually broken into lines on

0:46:13.990,0:46:18.46,the computer yeah you don't have you

0:46:17.109,0:46:22.72,don't feel like you still have that

0:46:18.460,0:46:25.06,freedom - well I do I do I do experiment

0:46:22.720,0:46:28.75,or you know something I'll go oh this is

0:46:25.060,0:46:34.50,15 lines it's so close to us on it I

0:46:28.750,0:46:37.45,don't I help it along you know so then

0:46:34.500,0:46:44.68,there should be like another times or 1,
0:46:37.450,0:46:47.44,money yeah okay so and then at that

0:46:44.680,0:46:49.51,point are the ponies ordered into the

0:46:47.440,0:46:52.00,way you would like them in the hotel not

0:46:49.510,0:46:52.93,never so how does that with that

0:46:52.000,0:46:57.18,processor

0:46:52.930,0:47:00.82,oh that's just another process of just

0:46:57.180,0:47:06.04,printing out all the poems and then just

0:47:00.820,0:47:10.51,living with them and that takes I know

0:47:06.040,0:47:16.74,maybe a year to maybe even longer

0:47:10.510,0:47:19.18,sometimes of experimenting with sections

0:47:16.740,0:47:21.69,you know the arrangement I'm working

0:47:19.180,0:47:27.35,right now in a book of prose poems and

0:47:21.690,0:47:33.03,I'm just really struggling with what's

0:47:27.359,0:47:35.38,what's even going to be in this book 1,
0:47:33.030,0:47:38.05,so there's there's a number so once you

0:47:35.380,0:47:39.79,get as a computer are you putting like

0:47:38.050,0:47:42.16,all the poems from windows look in one

0:47:39.790,0:47:46.60,word file say or are you putting them

0:47:42.160,0:47:50.83,individually um no I don't put I each

0:47:46.600,0:47:54.07,poem is its own file until I really

0:47:50.830,0:47:56.71,start to make the book as a book okay

0:47:54.070,0:47:58.60,until you're like so it's just

0:47:56.710,0:48:00.55,technically then you play call that file

0:47:58.600,0:48:03.01,whatever the title of the poem is yeah

0:48:00.550,0:48:10.00,and then save it saved in a folder with

0:48:03.010,0:48:12.36,my folder is called home al and there

0:48:10.000,0:48:13.30,are some subfolders in their labors

0:48:12.369,0:48:15.16,um

0:48:13.300,0:48:17.71,for a book would you make us a folder

0:48:15.160,0:48:20.98,then or well then each book gets its own

0:48:17.710,0:48:22.78,file then okay yeah okay but it's so the

0:48:20.980,0:48:24.88,poems are kind of in one day folder and

0:48:22.780,0:48:27.13,then as they calculate into a book that

0:48:24.880,0:48:29.53,will be 1/5 exactly and if it when they

0:48:27.130,0:48:32.26,get published and I put them in another

0:48:29.530,0:48:34.69,file called published poems okay so I

0:48:32.260,0:48:38.38,don't get don't get confused and not

0:48:34.690,0:48:40.36,spending yeah so yeah and then there's

0:48:38.380,0:48:47.05,some old you know I have filed called

0:48:40.360,0:48:50.35,files called pawns Oh ate better just

0:48:47.050,0:48:52.63,like I'm never going to probably do

0:48:50.350,0:48:58.18,anything with them now but they're still

0:48:52.630,0:48:59.53,sitting there and is that the same that

0:48:58.180,0:49:07.66,same sort of transfer happened with

0:48:59.530,0:49:12.69,fiction - um yeah I mean I've got a file

0:49:07.660,0:49:16.36,in there just called stories in process

0:49:12.690,0:49:23.77,and I don't know if they're going to be

0:49:16.360,0:49:25.51,a book yeah and so we'll get back to

0:49:23.770,0:49:27.73,computer stuff a little bit more let me

0:49:25.510,0:49:28.87,just sort of talk a little bit move from

0:49:27.730,0:49:31.54,revision and talk a little bit more

0:49:28.870,0:49:32.89,about kind of organizational and if

0:49:31.540,0:49:40.66,we're already kind of talking about it

0:49:32.890,0:49:44.14,these things also mention any but so I

0:49:40.660,0:49:45.88,mean well okay but with the computer

0:49:44.140,0:49:47.62,then you know you move from your

0:49:45.880,0:49:49.06,notebook and then you type it up and is

0:49:47.620,0:49:51.91,that that sort of a moment of revision

0:49:49.060,0:49:53.56,for you - and then you have several

0:49:51.910,0:49:55.75,other different moments of revision when

0:49:53.560,0:49:57.19,it's on the computer but some of those

0:49:55.750,0:50:00.01,happen in paper because you print them

0:49:57.190,0:50:02.29,out right and then that's that

0:50:00.010,0:50:07.21,arrangement happens physically usually

0:50:02.290,0:50:10.48,first and oh look I will look at it I'll

0:50:07.210,0:50:12.10,come back to it over a period of a I

0:50:10.480,0:50:13.92,don't know a couple of weeks on the

0:50:12.100,0:50:17.41,computer then once it's in a computer

0:50:13.920,0:50:19.21,file and look at it probably tinker with

0:50:17.410,0:50:20.65,it a little bit more before and then

0:50:19.210,0:50:23.68,I'll start sending it out probably

0:50:20.650,0:50:26.26,scooter so fairly soon after I type it

0:50:23.680,0:50:30.49,up maybe a month too

0:50:26.260,0:50:33.55,yeah I there comes a point where I feel

0:50:30.490,0:50:34.78,like I'm making it worse yeah yeah my

0:50:33.550,0:50:37.15,tinkering is starting to make it worse

0:50:34.780,0:50:45.55,that's the only thing that stops me and

0:50:37.150,0:50:48.30,then I start sending it out and it's our

0:50:45.550,0:50:51.73,book right now no just individual poems

0:50:48.300,0:50:53.29,and then if it comes back rejected often

0:50:51.730,0:50:57.57,I'll tinker a little bit more and send

0:50:53.290,0:50:59.71,it back out again so you use the sort of

0:50:57.570,0:51:05.61,publication and submission process as a

0:50:59.710,0:51:05.61,sort of revision proper I do okay hmm

0:51:06.150,0:51:11.74,and then so okay then they come together

0:51:09.070,0:51:13.39,in one file as your focal saying in

0:51:11.740,0:51:15.37,between and that out and then the

0:51:13.390,0:51:17.44,publishers and it's a similar sort of

0:51:15.370,0:51:19.87,thing accusative subjective you can

0:51:17.440,0:51:21.25,revise again or that sort of once it's

0:51:19.870,0:51:22.96,in that file once you've got it there

0:51:21.250,0:51:29.59,you just sort of want to get to give it

0:51:22.960,0:51:31.54,a see um I hope probably revise it a

0:51:29.590,0:51:36.28,little bit more if it comes back

0:51:31.540,0:51:37.21,rejected but usually once it skips in

0:51:36.280,0:51:41.47,book form

0:51:37.210,0:51:44.53,um yeah it seems sort of settled to me

0:51:41.470,0:51:47.74,and often that this may be a awful the

0:51:44.530,0:51:49.81,case um the reason for that being that

0:51:47.740,0:51:53.05,I've probably moved on to another book

0:51:49.810,0:51:57.01,about it and that's another don't work

0:51:53.050,0:51:59.53,yeah yeah no an actual and I'm actually

0:51:57.010,0:52:04.42,compiling another book at that point

0:51:59.530,0:52:07.09,when I start to me one out and how many

0:52:04.420,0:52:09.34,books do you usually have going how many

0:52:07.090,0:52:11.80,projects at one time you usually have

0:52:09.340,0:52:15.07,two well I almost always have a book of

0:52:11.800,0:52:17.41,poems yes in process that I'm working on

0:52:15.070,0:52:20.88,like I said right now we'll keep trying

0:52:17.410,0:52:23.20,to shape up this book of prose poems and

0:52:20.880,0:52:26.46,then I almost always have a book of

0:52:23.200,0:52:30.67,fiction that's in process right now I'm

0:52:26.460,0:52:35.14,working on a ebooks novel novella thing

0:52:30.670,0:52:37.72,and and then you know I'm doing the

0:52:35.140,0:52:40.03,photos and also in terms of like

0:52:37.720,0:52:44.62,publishing individual pieces

0:52:40.030,0:52:47.68,I'm really doing those a lot okay

0:52:44.620,0:52:49.48,and then so in terms of just sort of

0:52:47.680,0:52:51.58,saving and archiving in your work

0:52:49.480,0:52:53.44,you think we talked a little bit about

0:52:51.580,0:52:57.10,this to keep your notebooks basically in

0:52:53.440,0:52:59.29,boxes on the shelf and then your files

0:52:57.100,0:53:00.85,are in a folder and they just stay in

0:52:59.290,0:53:04.39,the same folder and you put them to an

0:53:00.850,0:53:07.27,external drive yep importantly is there

0:53:04.390,0:53:08.80,any other kind of archival or backup

0:53:07.270,0:53:16.78,procedures that you go through for your

0:53:08.800,0:53:19.45,work or is that pretty much yes I guess

0:53:16.780,0:53:25.69,that's pretty much it I mean my

0:53:19.450,0:53:28.87,publishers I think have copies you know

0:53:25.690,0:53:34.54,they have PDF yeah of everything right

0:53:28.870,0:53:44.74,so I rely on them but those are not

0:53:34.540,0:53:48.16,going to go away I don't they send me to

0:53:44.740,0:53:50.98,prove now yes yeah okay and they used to

0:53:48.160,0:53:53.16,send you galleys or or pretty though

0:53:50.980,0:53:55.96,yeah huh

0:53:53.160,0:53:57.67,and where do you do much revision in the

0:53:55.960,0:54:02.67,best days not that one they don't like

0:53:57.670,0:54:04.99,it okay yeah yeah okay so then I guess

0:54:02.670,0:54:06.25,one question more and then I want to

0:54:04.990,0:54:09.40,talk kind of about computers

0:54:06.250,0:54:11.74,specifically but do you see kind of a

0:54:09.400,0:54:12.91,Miss talking listed is there was there

0:54:11.740,0:54:14.56,sort of thing you kind of delineate

0:54:12.910,0:54:16.60,stages in your own writing over the

0:54:14.560,0:54:18.69,course of your you know your stupid

0:54:16.600,0:54:20.80,writing so professionally do you see

0:54:18.690,0:54:27.28,distinct stages or do you think it's

0:54:20.800,0:54:29.61,just been kind of gradual you mean

0:54:27.280,0:54:31.87,that's where things have just changed

0:54:29.610,0:54:33.28,dramatically or like you know they could

0:54:31.870,0:54:34.93,have changed over like a couple of years

0:54:33.280,0:54:36.10,but I mean I could you can't would you

0:54:34.930,0:54:38.20,say there are stages or would you just

0:54:36.100,0:54:39.64,see it kind of and if there were

0:54:38.200,0:54:41.38,anything that kind of prompted some

0:54:39.640,0:54:42.64,changes well for those I guess it's

0:54:41.380,0:54:46.94,where I'm kind of filling

0:54:42.640,0:54:51.77,well I think it's mostly been gradual

0:54:46.940,0:54:55.58,that I've I've grown more comfortable

0:54:51.770,0:54:59.00,doing some revision work on the computer

0:54:55.580,0:55:01.22,and especially with the fiction and

0:54:59.000,0:55:07.49,maybe because fiction is still feels

0:55:01.220,0:55:11.10,like a newer form to me one shift that

0:55:07.490,0:55:15.23,has felt a little bit more dramatic with

0:55:11.109,0:55:18.94,composing is that I have found myself

0:55:15.230,0:55:24.08,and I'm working on short stories

0:55:18.940,0:55:26.54,actually doing some new composing work

0:55:24.080,0:55:31.01,right here while I'm sitting there like

0:55:26.540,0:55:35.69,out I'll be working on a story you know

0:55:31.010,0:55:39.85,thinking I'm typing in from my notebook

0:55:35.690,0:55:43.13,and actually I remember working on this

0:55:39.859,0:55:45.61,one story and I had written them

0:55:43.130,0:55:49.43,something a note to myself in my

0:55:45.619,0:55:52.33,notebook that said flush out her dream

0:55:49.430,0:55:54.32,right here and I had forgotten to do

0:55:52.339,0:55:59.18,that so I remember sitting here doing it

0:55:54.320,0:56:02.78,while I was typing in the story on this

0:55:59.180,0:56:04.45,into my word file and I thought when I

0:56:02.780,0:56:08.48,wrote was okay

0:56:04.450,0:56:11.51,and it sort of freed me up then to do

0:56:08.480,0:56:15.41,that more frequently to let myself do

0:56:11.510,0:56:17.42,some of the initial composing although I

0:56:15.410,0:56:20.15,still kind of like have a little cue

0:56:17.420,0:56:21.77,that what it's going to be you know like

0:56:20.150,0:56:25.13,there's a little hole that I forgot to

0:56:21.770,0:56:29.30,do or and I have a note to myself in the

0:56:25.130,0:56:31.91,notebook okay so do that I guess how

0:56:29.300,0:56:34.67,does was the difference in feel between

0:56:31.910,0:56:36.68,I guess Barry doesn't care does writing

0:56:34.670,0:56:40.45,with two-handed writing versus one yeah

0:56:36.680,0:56:43.73,what one of the things that I like about

0:56:40.450,0:56:49.25,doing it on the computer is I can close

0:56:43.730,0:56:52.43,my eyes which isn't really odd but I

0:56:49.250,0:56:53.54,like it and so it seems to lend itself

0:56:52.430,0:56:58.07,to

0:56:53.540,0:57:00.76,whoo somewheres not to dialogues or

0:56:58.070,0:57:04.28,actions but to real kind of interior

0:57:00.760,0:57:06.86,moments where I'm in a character's mind

0:57:04.280,0:57:08.99,and I want to replicate our thinking

0:57:06.860,0:57:10.58,process like I said what's the first

0:57:08.990,0:57:13.67,time I ever tried it was where I kind of

0:57:10.580,0:57:16.40,tried to render a dream but the

0:57:13.670,0:57:18.50,character had had so I close my eyes you

0:57:16.400,0:57:21.53,know he's Corsican type of rifle right

0:57:18.500,0:57:26.02,but I can't write with my icicle okay

0:57:21.530,0:57:26.02,you really invertible yeah yeah yeah

0:57:28.840,0:57:36.11,okay so in terms of computers generally

0:57:32.840,0:57:39.83,when did you when did they enter into

0:57:36.110,0:57:41.54,your writing process well when I I

0:57:39.830,0:57:42.92,remember when I moved to Lake Forest

0:57:41.540,0:57:44.21,College I knew were going to ask me this

0:57:42.920,0:57:47.84,I was trying to think about this the

0:57:44.210,0:57:52.82,other day and we got these when I wish I

0:57:47.840,0:57:56.00,could k-pro favorite okay have you heard

0:57:52.820,0:58:01.34,of those no oh my god they were these

0:57:56.000,0:58:08.99,huge grey boxes and they were given to

0:58:01.340,0:58:12.56,us this must have been 1980 right around

0:58:08.990,0:58:14.84,there 1980 at Lake Forest College all

0:58:12.560,0:58:17.69,the faculty got these k-pro computer

0:58:14.840,0:58:22.88,things and really all they did was word

0:58:17.690,0:58:24.92,processing so but I liked him I remember

0:58:22.880,0:58:28.07,a lot of the faculty were complaining

0:58:24.920,0:58:30.05,but I believe you know because I was

0:58:28.070,0:58:33.77,moving from I like a Selectric

0:58:30.050,0:58:36.17,typewriter something and this machine

0:58:33.770,0:58:39.80,was so much easier to do corrections and

0:58:36.170,0:58:41.60,everything yeah and so I took to the

0:58:39.800,0:58:44.87,computer right away I really liked it

0:58:41.600,0:58:47.69,you making me yeah okay that's very

0:58:44.870,0:58:48.98,really well I can't remember the exact

0:58:47.690,0:58:51.95,here somewhere I mean you started

0:58:48.980,0:58:53.78,teaching in Lake Forest in 79 so it was

0:58:51.950,0:58:55.91,right around there when we first moved

0:58:53.780,0:58:58.58,there yeah and that's all they did they

0:58:55.910,0:59:01.72,didn't do there was no internet or right

0:58:58.580,0:59:05.02,yeah we were just just WordPerfect yeah

0:59:01.720,0:59:05.02,did this

0:59:05.590,0:59:10.21,well the advent of this computer and

0:59:08.080,0:59:11.98,then maybe like the kind of more

0:59:10.210,0:59:13.96,prevalence of computers kind of change

0:59:11.980,0:59:19.39,your writing practices pretty

0:59:13.960,0:59:23.22,drastically eventually or well and the

0:59:19.390,0:59:27.34,you know the academic world I don't know

0:59:23.220,0:59:30.82,if I hadn't been in the Academy if I

0:59:27.340,0:59:33.85,would be have the same relationship with

0:59:30.820,0:59:36.37,technology as I do because everywhere I

0:59:33.850,0:59:39.09,went to teach I was presented with a new

0:59:36.370,0:59:44.31,computer when I walked in the door and

0:59:39.090,0:59:50.05,and it's nice and because you know Apple

0:59:44.310,0:59:52.51,made its money by habituation habitual I

0:59:50.050,0:59:55.36,seen people with Lauren trying to say no

0:59:52.510,0:59:57.88,to their to their technology yes that's

0:59:55.360,1:00:00.31,how they became so great you know you

0:59:57.880,1:00:02.35,know get all these freshmen hooked on

1:00:00.310,1:00:04.69,apples when they're in college because

1:00:02.350,1:00:06.25,they're in the labs and then the next

1:00:04.690,1:00:10.63,thing you know you've got generations

1:00:06.250,1:00:13.57,out there and so anyway I am the total

1:00:10.630,1:00:17.02,Mac person I love them I think they seem

1:00:13.570,1:00:19.81,really intuitive to me to use them but

1:00:17.020,1:00:24.04,and but I've grown up with them great I

1:00:19.810,1:00:25.66,mean so and then I guess what about the

1:00:24.040,1:00:27.85,software that you used you started with

1:00:25.660,1:00:31.11,the sort of basic word processing did

1:00:27.850,1:00:34.72,you move to an Apple word processing

1:00:31.110,1:00:38.23,software or was it like WordPerfect or

1:00:34.720,1:00:40.21,you remember I mean I can't even me no

1:00:38.230,1:00:41.86,no gosh I'm not going to be able to

1:00:40.210,1:00:44.02,remember all the different program names

1:00:41.860,1:00:46.51,but yeah and now are using Microsoft

1:00:44.020,1:00:49.51,Word uh-huh okay but you're also using

1:00:46.510,1:00:51.55,pages yeah so so you're looking between

1:00:49.510,1:00:55.54,software there has that been a newer

1:00:51.550,1:00:58.24,thing since the iPad or yeah I may get a

1:00:55.540,1:01:00.39,new iPad pretty soon up and I don't I

1:00:58.240,1:01:03.37,don't know if I want to buy another

1:01:00.390,1:01:06.13,Microsoft Word you know yeah I'm getting

1:01:03.370,1:01:09.01,agencies next time yeah it moves can't

1:01:06.130,1:01:15.68,afford to find great great

1:01:09.010,1:01:18.36,but I learned um Photoshop okay

1:01:15.680,1:01:23.43,when I was magazine editor

1:01:18.360,1:01:24.06,I edited Willow Springs for about six

1:01:23.430,1:01:27.15,years

1:01:24.060,1:01:29.22,and so I've learned that what's in 199,
1:01:27.150,1:01:31.58,he took over the editorship of that

1:01:29.220,1:01:36.80,magazine when I came out to Eastern and

1:01:31.580,1:01:40.07,they they were doing the magazine with

1:01:36.800,1:01:43.17,there was null computer technology the

1:01:40.070,1:01:49.74,woman who had done it before me was like

1:01:43.170,1:01:51.57,she was into the light board thing which

1:01:49.740,1:01:54.78,I had learnt which I had learned in

1:01:51.570,1:01:57.72,college I in journalism class you know

1:01:54.780,1:01:59.76,with the sticky pili thing you really

1:01:57.720,1:02:02.43,like you I actually saw this in high

1:01:59.760,1:02:05.10,school in my journalism class - yes and

1:02:02.430,1:02:08.79,I could not believe that that they had

1:02:05.100,1:02:11.52,no computer program or anything so a guy

1:02:08.790,1:02:14.49,in the journalism department gave me a

1:02:11.520,1:02:16.50,copy page maker to put on the computer

1:02:14.490,1:02:22.23,and I instantly fell in love with it

1:02:16.500,1:02:24.03,yeah I just oh I loved us I love doing

1:02:22.230,1:02:26.13,the art for the magazine I did the

1:02:24.030,1:02:28.74,covers you know I mean I found the art

1:02:26.130,1:02:32.00,and made the covers myself because there

1:02:28.740,1:02:35.46,was nobody else to do it right and so I

1:02:32.000,1:02:38.25,learned pagemaker at the very beginning

1:02:35.460,1:02:42.53,when it was just out and then she

1:02:38.250,1:02:45.84,probably know that became social so I

1:02:42.530,1:02:49.59,just kind of stayed with it on all these

1:02:45.840,1:02:56.91,years and now easily sorted out this one

1:02:49.590,1:02:59.73,of years Wow and you know I buy every

1:02:56.910,1:03:01.53,other Photoshop fests that's been my mo

1:02:59.730,1:03:05.64,I don't try to keep up with every single

1:03:01.530,1:03:07.86,new one so I'm on five now but I will

1:03:05.640,1:03:08.88,probably get seven with I'm a little

1:03:07.860,1:03:10.23,worried that they're not going to do

1:03:08.880,1:03:12.72,that anymore they seem to be moving

1:03:10.230,1:03:15.72,sabbatical a subscription basis you

1:03:12.720,1:03:17.22,really yeah how do you mean well you

1:03:15.720,1:03:20.58,know we buy it a lot for the digital

1:03:17.220,1:03:22.20,secures and I'm starting to hear that

1:03:20.580,1:03:23.88,there's you know they're offering it now

1:03:22.200,1:03:25.04,season you know basically pay a monthly

1:03:23.880,1:03:27.70,fee and get photos

1:03:25.049,1:03:30.95,or get in design or get the design suite

1:03:27.709,1:03:31.97,but that so I'm not sure how often if

1:03:30.959,1:03:34.04,they're going to be selling those like

1:03:31.979,1:03:34.64,student teachers kind of additions

1:03:34.049,1:03:36.32,anymore

1:03:34.649,1:03:38.72,Oh or if they're going to be charging a

1:03:36.329,1:03:39.77,subscription fee which in my mind is

1:03:38.729,1:03:41.18,going to be windmill expensive

1:03:39.779,1:03:42.41,assistance as we have so many topics it

1:03:41.189,1:03:45.63,might be cheaper overall for an

1:03:42.419,1:03:47.51,individual but interesting yeah so I'm

1:03:45.630,1:03:49.70,not sure I'm not actually positive about

1:03:47.519,1:03:56.30,that but I sort of have heard on the

1:03:49.709,1:04:00.28,wind that might be no wow that was okay

1:03:56.309,1:04:02.78,it's a tax write-off oh yeah yeah yeah

1:04:00.289,1:04:05.72,so you were you were pretty familiar

1:04:02.789,1:04:07.33,with computers from from pretty much

1:04:05.729,1:04:09.65,your most invisible professional career

1:04:07.339,1:04:12.20,as they became more prevalent in the

1:04:09.659,1:04:13.76,society at large did that effect I mean

1:04:12.209,1:04:15.17,I guess it affected probably your

1:04:13.769,1:04:17.93,correspondence with your editors and

1:04:15.179,1:04:19.76,whatnot in your saclink like that did

1:04:17.939,1:04:21.59,that affect anything in the way that you

1:04:19.769,1:04:27.28,write to do start to feel different it

1:04:21.599,1:04:28.52,writing feel different um it felt more

1:04:27.289,1:04:34.46,constant

1:04:28.529,1:04:37.40,I guess I'm my students at Vermont

1:04:34.469,1:04:42.17,College they want to send me their work

1:04:37.409,1:04:45.32,everything online now and I feel like I

1:04:42.179,1:04:48.98,cannot I cannot get away from sitting

1:04:45.329,1:04:54.23,here you know 10 hours 12 hours a day

1:04:48.989,1:04:58.76,and that's that part I I don't like as

1:04:54.239,1:05:01.25,much I I still I like reading you

1:04:58.769,1:05:02.88,knowing that in a comfy chair and I feel

1:05:01.259,1:05:05.30,like we're moving away from that now

1:05:02.880,1:05:07.52,because that's becoming less and I'm you

1:05:05.309,1:05:11.75,know I'm writing ebooks myself now so

1:05:07.529,1:05:13.58,yeah so I'm a culprit to free but I can

1:05:11.759,1:05:16.36,leave my iPad in a comfy chair

1:05:13.589,1:05:16.36,yes

1:05:18.220,1:05:24.07,I still like reading in bed but once I

1:05:21.850,1:05:37.42,discovered that I can read my iPad in

1:05:24.070,1:05:41.22,bed I was happy I am sort of interested

1:05:37.420,1:05:43.87,- I guess did sort of typographical or

1:05:41.220,1:05:45.34,more graphical things I mean you see

1:05:43.870,1:05:47.80,working familiar with PageMaker did that

1:05:45.340,1:05:49.87,did any of that like ability of the

1:05:47.800,1:05:51.70,computer to adjust or I mean like I like

1:05:49.870,1:05:53.95,I think in quake with those the breaks

1:05:51.700,1:05:55.57,that were kind of like speaks a lot my

1:05:53.950,1:05:58.29,kind of jagged lines I don't know where

1:05:55.570,1:06:01.84,those came from Aceves computer thing or

1:05:58.290,1:06:03.19,you don't talk about section breaks like

1:06:01.840,1:06:04.60,the breaks within the stories that would

1:06:03.190,1:06:08.11,be like yeah like section breaks they

1:06:04.600,1:06:10.09,had like kind of I think that might've

1:06:08.110,1:06:13.12,been the science book design or those

1:06:10.090,1:06:14.74,design okay but did any of that

1:06:13.120,1:06:16.66,influence your writing I mean did you

1:06:14.740,1:06:19.09,start to and then you obviously what

1:06:16.660,1:06:21.73,response and design aspects and layout

1:06:19.090,1:06:23.62,did that influence anything with your

1:06:21.730,1:06:25.48,poems I mean I know they also you know a

1:06:23.620,1:06:26.89,lot of them will have least the earlier

1:06:25.480,1:06:30.07,one some of them would move kind of tab

1:06:26.890,1:06:32.05,by tab and then I mean there's other

1:06:30.070,1:06:35.47,different sort of strategies in palms

1:06:32.050,1:06:37.75,too but there I don't know I mean I'm

1:06:35.470,1:06:44.86,trying to think about what you're asking

1:06:37.750,1:06:46.96,me because I just want remembering um or

1:06:44.860,1:06:49.60,if there's any particular way that that

1:06:46.960,1:06:51.52,changed in my writing itself yeah I mean

1:06:49.600,1:06:54.43,I don't think it wasn't I don't know

1:06:51.520,1:06:55.60,that I can say that it I guess when

1:06:54.430,1:06:56.47,you're writing in your note baby that's

1:06:55.600,1:06:58.93,the way to get when you're writing in

1:06:56.470,1:07:00.52,your notebook are you writing with sort

1:06:58.930,1:07:02.20,of indentation and other things like

1:07:00.520,1:07:07.75,that or are you pretty much down the

1:07:02.200,1:07:09.10,left margin to those who does that sort

1:07:07.750,1:07:10.51,of layout saying transfer to the

1:07:09.100,1:07:13.87,computer right you're right you know I

1:07:10.510,1:07:16.78,what little experimenting I've done

1:07:13.870,1:07:20.47,along those lines with poems I've done

1:07:16.780,1:07:23.98,on the computer screen sugar yeah I mean

1:07:20.470,1:07:26.26,that's I think my I know we're going to

1:07:23.980,1:07:29.20,talk about this later what I'm doing now

1:07:26.260,1:07:30.94,I'm doing these altered book pages right

1:07:29.200,1:07:32.70,you know if I showed you any of those

1:07:30.940,1:07:37.12,crystals are all blah

1:07:32.700,1:07:41.22,files but I'm doing these altered book

1:07:37.120,1:07:44.26,pages and those are that's where all

1:07:41.220,1:07:47.23,everything I know about Photoshop and my

1:07:44.260,1:07:51.55,poetry is like finally coming together

1:07:47.230,1:07:55.42,into something that feels more I don't

1:07:51.550,1:07:56.89,know my own yeah different so we can

1:07:55.420,1:07:58.80,talk about that everybody

1:07:56.890,1:08:04.75,so is that different than the photons

1:07:58.800,1:08:06.37,yeah okay yeah um what sort of for

1:08:04.750,1:08:12.82,tonight I'll show you

1:08:06.370,1:08:14.68,so I'm um I put these online I send this

1:08:12.820,1:08:19.03,is mainly what I've been publishing

1:08:14.680,1:08:24.49,lately I found this old encyclopedia up

1:08:19.030,1:08:28.21,here from the 30s and I've been scanning

1:08:24.490,1:08:32.11,the pages okay especially pages that

1:08:28.210,1:08:43.90,have a lot of graphic material in them

1:08:32.110,1:08:48.73,and yeah so I I put them on this website

1:08:43.900,1:08:52.24,but in a in a locked gallery cuz this is

1:08:48.730,1:08:55.93,how I share them then with editors oh ok

1:08:52.240,1:09:02.11,so let's see y'all try to find that it's

1:08:55.930,1:09:04.42,like Latino one here so Zenfolio is like

1:09:02.110,1:09:07.60,this like a webservice kind of yeah this

1:09:04.420,1:09:10.84,isn't really for photographers website

1:09:07.600,1:09:13.24,but I just liked it because it has a

1:09:10.840,1:09:16.03,really clean look yeah and their

1:09:13.240,1:09:17.74,slideshow mode is really nice yeah so

1:09:16.030,1:09:22.98,this is the book I'm doing with my

1:09:17.740,1:09:27.19,husband right now and these are his

1:09:22.980,1:09:32.47,these are his illustrations so I can

1:09:27.190,1:09:36.04,actually put this in slideshow you can

1:09:32.470,1:09:39.70,see that so this is my fiction project

1:09:36.040,1:09:42.49,okay that I'm busy the novella this is

1:09:39.700,1:09:44.29,yeah this I will only I haven't shared

1:09:42.490,1:09:46.00,this actually with any editors yet

1:09:44.290,1:09:53.88,because I'm only just putting this

1:09:46.000,1:09:58.33,online that's a section be lighter page

1:09:53.880,1:10:01.60,this is called a pull for stop so then

1:09:58.330,1:10:03.55,and then this story goes like this so

1:10:01.600,1:10:06.07,these are Rick's pieces and then I have

1:10:03.550,1:10:10.03,this little story that goes with these

1:10:06.070,1:10:12.28,characters in the book here and each

1:10:10.030,1:10:15.91,page I think of it as a little like

1:10:12.280,1:10:18.46,flash fiction yeah yeah so I kind of

1:10:15.910,1:10:20.53,think of them as linked flash fiction

1:10:18.460,1:10:23.65,and they're relating in some way to the

1:10:20.530,1:10:29.32,image oh yeah okay so that's that book

1:10:23.650,1:10:33.87,that book and I was telling you multi

1:10:29.320,1:10:33.87,encyclopedia and that's book of no ledge

1:10:34.920,1:10:42.97,and so this is how I send them out now

1:10:39.250,1:10:46.63,to editors hmm I'll probably send like

1:10:42.970,1:10:49.00,two or three of these pieces in you know

1:10:46.630,1:10:51.73,the online submission or whatever and

1:10:49.000,1:10:55.24,then I send them a link to this to this

1:10:51.730,1:10:57.25,gallery and the password that they need

1:10:55.240,1:11:01.36,to access it because the locked gallery

1:10:57.250,1:11:03.52,that way I can kind of track on you know

1:11:01.360,1:11:06.01,how many people are looking editors are

1:11:03.520,1:11:08.77,looking at myself at the same time right

1:11:06.010,1:11:11.56,and then when somebody takes a piece I

1:11:08.770,1:11:14.38,put these little asterisks this just

1:11:11.560,1:11:16.45,like screwed up things so they kind of

1:11:14.380,1:11:19.27,can realize all those are out of

1:11:16.450,1:11:26.40,commission then so that's what so now

1:11:19.270,1:11:29.29,I'm kind of actually putting a poem and

1:11:26.400,1:11:32.17,I hate all this fail stuff in here but

1:11:29.290,1:11:34.69,there's since then I'm actually kind of

1:11:32.170,1:11:39.01,replacing the text that was here in the

1:11:34.690,1:11:40.96,encyclopedia with a poem and and so

1:11:39.010,1:11:42.97,you'll do that in Photoshop like you'll

1:11:40.960,1:11:44.47,erase the text and then you'll are you

1:11:42.970,1:11:47.37,trying to match the font in some way it

1:11:44.470,1:11:50.02,looks like or at least kind of it I am

1:11:47.370,1:11:52.99,and then those are images from the text

1:11:50.020,1:11:56.26,originally yes actually they're from

1:11:52.990,1:12:00.10,like three different pages in the text

1:11:56.260,1:12:02.70,and then I've colorized them to Carlini

1:12:00.100,1:12:05.26,project it's really been fun I like I

1:12:02.700,1:12:07.23,like doing that you can see I've kind of

1:12:05.260,1:12:11.92,done a little bit of a racer stuff in

1:12:07.239,1:12:15.22,here yeah and then this part is my poem

1:12:11.920,1:12:18.69,over here so I like as I said put these

1:12:15.220,1:12:27.88,in slideshow cos they're come out water

1:12:18.690,1:12:32.02,but I kind of like having a mix of what

1:12:27.880,1:12:35.92,would be encyclopedia language with naps

1:12:32.020,1:12:40.66,talk kind of I like going back and forth

1:12:35.920,1:12:43.36,so that's this has been where I've

1:12:40.660,1:12:47.32,really started to use the technology

1:12:43.360,1:12:51.21,much more than I was before so I have

1:12:47.320,1:12:54.37,all those people this is the straight

1:12:51.210,1:12:57.34,cyclopædia man stuff and I hope they

1:12:54.370,1:13:04.78,kind of talk back and forth to each

1:12:57.340,1:13:07.45,other the language yeah no I see what

1:13:04.780,1:13:10.51,you're saying my language here in their

1:13:07.450,1:13:12.01,language and well I'm sorry it's sort of

1:13:10.510,1:13:15.19,like contextualizes and sort of

1:13:12.010,1:13:17.26,decontextualize isn't it yeah yes my

1:13:15.190,1:13:21.40,little conversation with proof I've been

1:13:17.260,1:13:27.70,reading proof to shared I see improves

1:13:21.400,1:13:29.86,there on a timeout right now anyway

1:13:27.700,1:13:31.78,that's Alaska thing looks like I like

1:13:29.860,1:13:33.88,the pate I like the pages from the

1:13:31.780,1:13:38.08,encyclopedia that have all this graphic

1:13:33.880,1:13:41.92,material so I can um I kind of take what

1:13:38.080,1:13:45.07,was you know I what I have I put all

1:13:41.920,1:13:49.18,these kind of romance words around in

1:13:45.070,1:13:51.40,this one timber Wolf's love nipped not

1:13:49.180,1:13:53.95,skok soulmate I gave them kind of

1:13:51.400,1:13:56.05,anything yeah different a merciless

1:13:53.950,1:13:58.06,but a person would have to sort of go in

1:13:56.050,1:14:01.33,there and look a little bit right that's

1:13:58.060,1:14:05.83,ready to see yeah I mean yeah I mean it

1:14:01.330,1:14:08.02,is to pay attention salt that's that's

1:14:05.830,1:14:09.72,where things have sort of evolved

1:14:08.020,1:14:13.20,computerized from

1:14:09.729,1:14:15.09,and how does that I mean what's the like

1:14:13.209,1:14:16.74,does it feel different is it disorder

1:14:15.099,1:14:18.96,that seem like the same creative process

1:14:16.749,1:14:21.94,for you I mean I mean it's visual and

1:14:18.969,1:14:24.30,textual so there's that but in terms of

1:14:21.940,1:14:29.13,using the computer to make is that a

1:14:24.309,1:14:31.95,change well so the way I've been I have

1:14:29.139,1:14:33.69,some really interesting different ways

1:14:31.959,1:14:37.20,that I've been doing these that have

1:14:33.699,1:14:40.38,never been even remotely like working on

1:14:37.209,1:14:44.97,the palms of stories so I'll print out

1:14:40.380,1:14:47.55,first the original scans and black and

1:14:44.979,1:14:49.20,white and that's what I carry around in

1:14:47.559,1:14:52.03,my little notebook you know I'm so

1:14:49.209,1:14:53.65,fixated to the notebook there so I'm

1:14:52.030,1:14:55.42,carrying those around the notebook and

1:14:53.650,1:14:58.42,then I just actually just start

1:14:55.420,1:15:03.42,scribbling on the pages scribbling stuff

1:14:58.420,1:15:05.73,out I'm one of the things that I'm kind

1:15:03.429,1:15:09.78,of doing with this book project with the

1:15:05.739,1:15:13.92,encyclopedia is this is my version of a

1:15:09.789,1:15:18.21,Collected Poems of Nance Van Winkle so

1:15:13.929,1:15:21.82,I'm kind of mining some of my early

1:15:18.219,1:15:23.67,poems because I the idea of doing a

1:15:21.820,1:15:26.44,collected or selected or something is

1:15:23.679,1:15:29.32,kind of boring to me actually okay but

1:15:26.440,1:15:31.69,this made it more interesting to do yes

1:15:29.320,1:15:34.92,because I'll just pull out oh I always

1:15:31.690,1:15:38.13,like this Danson yeah I like to stand

1:15:34.929,1:15:41.40,and then I you forget the rest of that

1:15:38.139,1:15:44.40,foam you know but these five lines I

1:15:41.409,1:15:47.53,like so I'll sprinkle them in there and

1:15:44.409,1:15:51.15,it's been fun to kind of find the visual

1:15:47.530,1:15:54.15,material that I think they fit with yeah

1:15:51.159,1:15:56.22,so anyway I'm so wealth of human

1:15:54.159,1:16:00.24,knowledge from thirty thirty well

1:15:56.229,1:16:04.36,exactly exactly and you know I feel like

1:16:00.249,1:16:05.73,I'm kind of talking I am I said one of

1:16:04.360,1:16:08.49,the things that's going on in this

1:16:05.739,1:16:15.32,project is I'm talking back to history

1:16:08.499,1:16:19.57,in a way and say no that's not right and

1:16:15.329,1:16:21.18,I like that I like that Marisa and I

1:16:19.570,1:16:24.09,guess in some ways the software allows

1:16:21.189,1:16:26.55,you more

1:16:24.099,1:16:28.63,purchase on making them deletion and

1:16:26.559,1:16:33.46,adjustment exactly and it would have

1:16:28.630,1:16:34.44,really crossing out or like board right

1:16:33.460,1:16:35.98,yeah

1:16:34.449,1:16:38.40,and the erase you're saying you know

1:16:35.980,1:16:40.21,that a lot of people are doing yeah that

1:16:38.409,1:16:43.05,seems like you know I'm good friends

1:16:40.210,1:16:46.23,with Mary rueful through an amazing

1:16:43.059,1:16:48.67,resource every yeah I feel like I could

1:16:46.239,1:16:51.61,run up Mary rueful I'm not doing that

1:16:48.670,1:16:53.76,I'm not going there there are people who

1:16:51.610,1:16:56.59,are doing that so much better

1:16:53.760,1:16:59.44,I've always been a fan of it that Robbie

1:16:56.590,1:17:01.63,off to paradise block leashes around uh

1:16:59.440,1:17:07.21,uh how did this team like you're gonna

1:17:01.630,1:17:11.50,yeah and I weigh who did one like oh he

1:17:07.210,1:17:13.75,didn't really happy birth mirrors yeah a

1:17:11.500,1:17:14.96,lot I think maybe too many people jumped

1:17:13.750,1:17:17.67,on the eraser its

1:17:14.969,1:17:19.23,bandwagon it's but it's hot I mean it's

1:17:17.679,1:17:21.57,really I mean to do it in the latest

1:17:19.239,1:17:23.53,miracle so it is really really hard I

1:17:21.579,1:17:27.34,mean like yeah here's something area was

1:17:23.530,1:17:30.03,all set the way I do it is I look at the

1:17:27.340,1:17:32.34,page and then pretty soon if I just

1:17:30.039,1:17:44.71,stare at it for a while a few words

1:17:32.349,1:17:53.61,slowed up good okay oh oh

1:17:44.710,1:17:57.48,eliwood so words flowed up into a lot of

1:17:53.619,1:17:57.48,these questions in the course of it

1:18:08.270,1:18:12.61,Oh can you find your files like if

1:18:11.000,1:18:16.91,you're looking for like a certain phone

1:18:12.610,1:18:18.74,on your computer would you if you have

1:18:16.910,1:18:20.42,difficulty locating them or are you is

1:18:18.740,1:18:27.23,your organization such that you pretty

1:18:20.420,1:18:30.41,much know where things are I have lost I

1:18:27.230,1:18:34.04,have lost things and yeah almost every

1:18:30.410,1:18:36.58,week I have a little battle because I

1:18:34.040,1:18:40.88,can't remember why I called something

1:18:36.580,1:18:42.86,yeah yeah do you worry at all about the

1:18:40.880,1:18:48.11,security or some fixity of these digital

1:18:42.860,1:18:50.87,files no no you mean somebody else

1:18:48.110,1:18:54.56,accessing them or something that Jeremy

1:18:50.870,1:18:56.36,or the kind of fidelity of them I guess

1:18:54.560,1:18:58.07,I mean visitors I mean you do say that

1:18:56.360,1:18:59.78,you have floppy disks and old Word

1:18:58.070,1:19:01.82,Perfect documents or something that you

1:18:59.780,1:19:03.11,can't access that is that a concern to

1:19:01.820,1:19:04.60,you or you just think that will kind of

1:19:03.110,1:19:08.78,take care of itself

1:19:04.600,1:19:11.00,um it's not a concern to me maybe it

1:19:08.780,1:19:13.40,should be no I don't I actually don't

1:19:11.000,1:19:16.64,think it should be but um and I'm I'm

1:19:13.400,1:19:17.75,wanting to know that so okay but I mean

1:19:16.640,1:19:19.31,that yeah there's definitely things we

1:19:17.750,1:19:21.32,can do but I mean it's one of those

1:19:19.310,1:19:23.63,things that I think well I guess the

1:19:21.320,1:19:25.13,other question is have the changes in

1:19:23.630,1:19:29.36,computers I mean like you know probably

1:19:25.130,1:19:31.97,in the 98 90s early 90s computers

1:19:29.360,1:19:34.10,crashed much more often more likely to

1:19:31.970,1:19:37.48,lose work too bad ever influence the way

1:19:34.100,1:19:39.92,that you work on computers or was that

1:19:37.480,1:19:43.64,were you pretty much kept the same

1:19:39.920,1:19:46.04,strategies I have pretty much kept the

1:19:43.640,1:19:49.58,same strategy she no I've never had a

1:19:46.040,1:19:52.07,really bad thing happen where I've lost

1:19:49.580,1:20:01.01,the hard drive or anything like that I

1:19:52.070,1:20:04.19,know I know and you know they got you

1:20:01.010,1:20:09.11,bigger they really do I I just I love

1:20:04.190,1:20:10.91,all their products as I could so a few

1:20:09.110,1:20:12.62,questions are correspondences teaching

1:20:10.910,1:20:15.27,all the way to sever sabbatical couple

1:20:12.620,1:20:19.11,episode m and another view

1:20:15.270,1:20:21.04,so you have you ever correspondent very

1:20:19.119,1:20:23.23,much in like like physical letters has

1:20:21.040,1:20:24.63,that ever been a person or but I mean

1:20:23.230,1:20:26.08,play to your writing I don't need to

1:20:24.639,1:20:27.55,know you know the personal

1:20:26.080,1:20:30.69,correspondence not so much but I mean

1:20:27.550,1:20:35.34,like writing wise to realize that ever

1:20:30.690,1:20:37.06,no physical letters I well like I was

1:20:35.349,1:20:39.19,telling you with that first book of

1:20:37.060,1:20:44.59,poems I've kept all the letters that he

1:20:39.190,1:20:47.76,wrote to me about revision yeah I don't

1:20:44.590,1:20:50.13,know they just they're very dear to me

1:20:47.760,1:20:54.15,that somebody took that kind of time

1:20:50.139,1:20:56.50,with me and and then I have a good

1:20:54.159,1:20:59.29,friend who's a poet I think I mentioned

1:20:56.500,1:21:01.59,her to you Jennifer Boyd muse and she

1:20:59.290,1:21:03.52,really loves the physical letter and

1:21:01.599,1:21:05.53,I've kept all her letters that she's

1:21:03.520,1:21:08.38,written me over the years because

1:21:05.530,1:21:15.40,they're just beautiful and and it just

1:21:08.380,1:21:18.28,always seems like just the idea that

1:21:15.400,1:21:20.63,somebody is writing this just to me you

1:21:18.280,1:21:23.61,know the three page letter with her

1:21:20.639,1:21:25.50,thoughts and ruminations about things

1:21:23.619,1:21:28.71,and they're just so beautifully written

1:21:25.500,1:21:32.61,but she would take the time to do that

1:21:28.719,1:21:36.04,you know it's it seems like a treasure

1:21:32.619,1:21:38.40,thing because it's passing but do I do

1:21:36.040,1:21:38.40,it

1:21:39.610,1:21:45.88,do you have any similar feelings for

1:21:42.520,1:21:52.33,anything yes you have email but you to

1:21:45.880,1:21:56.23,feel fear about oh I do keep some emails

1:21:52.330,1:22:00.01,I have you know files these emails that

1:21:56.230,1:22:01.27,I keep from certain people a minute and

1:22:00.010,1:22:04.69,it's a corollary to that do you feel

1:22:01.270,1:22:06.48,like a this is an odd question but do

1:22:04.690,1:22:09.84,you have any sort of feelings towards

1:22:06.489,1:22:12.04,your digital files about yet your poem

1:22:09.849,1:22:13.33,you feel like are they dear to you in

1:22:12.040,1:22:18.01,the same way maybe a notebook would be

1:22:13.330,1:22:20.46,here you or no no the notebook is dearer

1:22:18.010,1:22:24.69,okay I don't know I don't know what

1:22:20.469,1:22:26.46,that's weird touch it is could it be

1:22:24.699,1:22:28.63,part of it is

1:22:26.460,1:22:30.37,yeah there's me I don't know yeah it's

1:22:28.630,1:22:31.84,one of those one of those things I don't

1:22:30.370,1:22:33.64,know if that will change

1:22:31.840,1:22:36.34,like if someone never had but this is

1:22:33.640,1:22:38.11,cool in the future it would have the

1:22:36.340,1:22:41.25,special folder on the desktop that just

1:22:38.110,1:22:47.22,to talk to me but you know I try to be

1:22:41.250,1:22:50.65,careful that I've always got a hardcopy

1:22:47.220,1:22:52.63,somewhere the material I'm working I

1:22:50.650,1:22:54.78,like this book that I'm doing with my

1:22:52.630,1:23:00.76,husband okay

1:22:54.780,1:23:05.68,and there they all are because and the

1:23:00.760,1:23:09.12,way that well to finish that that

1:23:05.680,1:23:12.82,thought about just being careful because

1:23:09.120,1:23:16.03,it's just if things go awry here I

1:23:12.820,1:23:19.18,really I don't want to lose the work

1:23:16.030,1:23:21.37,completely free so I try to make sure

1:23:19.180,1:23:23.65,that I have a hard copy it's not always

1:23:21.370,1:23:28.03,the most recent copy yeah but there's

1:23:23.650,1:23:32.95,there's the coffee right so and with

1:23:28.030,1:23:35.17,this book I did all of the arranging of

1:23:32.950,1:23:37.93,it I stuck them on that wall in the

1:23:35.170,1:23:41.32,hallway okay and all the pages were on

1:23:37.930,1:23:43.33,that wall and I was moving I had little

1:23:41.320,1:23:46.45,sticky things on the back and I was

1:23:43.330,1:23:49.30,moving them around to make the sections

1:23:46.450,1:23:50.02,of the book for it was up there for like

1:23:49.300,1:23:53.80,three months

1:23:50.020,1:23:55.27,yeah three three months off so you would

1:23:53.800,1:23:57.28,just would you come home and see them

1:23:55.270,1:23:59.23,and make a few changes or was it

1:23:57.280,1:24:03.94,basically be a dedicated time that you

1:23:59.230,1:24:05.80,go to it er um well it was I was at that

1:24:03.940,1:24:08.92,stage with the book or I had all these

1:24:05.800,1:24:11.53,pages but I wasn't exactly sure you know

1:24:08.920,1:24:14.77,how I was going to arrange the the

1:24:11.530,1:24:17.44,chronology again on the story yeah so I

1:24:14.770,1:24:22.24,started experimenting with different

1:24:17.440,1:24:24.67,orders of things by putting this China

1:24:22.240,1:24:27.52,sections on the on the boards on the

1:24:24.670,1:24:30.82,wall that way yeah moving them around so

1:24:27.520,1:24:35.83,because s so before I had each page as

1:24:30.820,1:24:37.33,its own file in there and now and now

1:24:35.830,1:24:39.43,they have sections to

1:24:37.330,1:24:42.37,section I think they're five sections in

1:24:39.430,1:24:46.00,the book and those came from the wall

1:24:42.370,1:24:48.85,yeah okay so but I had to I could not

1:24:46.000,1:24:51.40,figure out a way to look at that many

1:24:48.850,1:24:55.06,pages on the screen at one time and I

1:24:51.400,1:24:58.48,mean actually see the print okay that

1:24:55.060,1:25:01.06,was yeah I felt like I the technology

1:24:58.480,1:25:08.56,wasn't allowing me to see the big

1:25:01.060,1:25:11.52,picture the way I needed to I'm sure

1:25:08.560,1:25:15.22,they're coming after they're here yeah

1:25:11.520,1:25:22.56,exactly yeah you too big wall this is

1:25:15.220,1:25:25.92,you and if Mac makes it I'm buying it is

1:25:22.560,1:25:30.13,only going to be a million dollars yeah

1:25:25.920,1:25:32.95,I guess we did talk a little bit about

1:25:30.130,1:25:34.54,your teaching and that you do correspond

1:25:32.950,1:25:39.52,by email with your students mostly is

1:25:34.540,1:25:43.69,that um now if they insist on it okay

1:25:39.520,1:25:45.55,I'm sending me their work as attachments

1:25:43.690,1:25:47.59,and everything I'll read it that way I

1:25:45.550,1:25:49.63,don't like doing it with the poet's with

1:25:47.590,1:25:51.97,the fiction people I was much much

1:25:49.630,1:25:54.85,rather they send me their work in the

1:25:51.970,1:25:56.80,mail okay and usually they're okay with

1:25:54.850,1:25:58.69,them you kind of take it and not have to

1:25:56.800,1:26:01.87,be connected and not have to and then

1:25:58.690,1:26:05.26,yeah yeah and I just I do not like

1:26:01.870,1:26:08.76,writing my comments laundress in with

1:26:05.260,1:26:12.37,the blackboard program or any of those

1:26:08.760,1:26:14.98,the college has that available to us and

1:26:12.370,1:26:17.77,I have done track changes in word I know

1:26:14.980,1:26:20.65,how to use that okay but I just I just

1:26:17.770,1:26:22.42,like to scribble in the largest right so

1:26:20.650,1:26:24.18,something that in that aspect of your

1:26:22.420,1:26:27.66,work and your life like you just

1:26:24.180,1:26:30.19,ultimately prefer physical

1:26:27.660,1:26:30.82,correspondence pull in yeah cool yeah

1:26:30.190,1:26:35.56,okay

1:26:30.820,1:26:38.41,yeah and then I guess the other thing

1:26:35.560,1:26:39.97,with with like writing and distraction I

1:26:38.410,1:26:41.26,guess is it's like when are you

1:26:39.970,1:26:42.79,connected to the internet when you're

1:26:41.260,1:26:45.16,writing do you ever have to like do it

1:26:42.790,1:26:46.28,like disconnect turn off your Wi-Fi or

1:26:45.160,1:26:50.30,something

1:26:46.280,1:26:52.25,Bravo one concern for you before you use

1:26:50.300,1:26:55.13,they are you think looking things up

1:26:52.250,1:26:58.67,while you're writing wrong that's a good

1:26:55.130,1:27:00.98,question um I don't like to be

1:26:58.670,1:27:04.43,disconnected from the net anymore yeah

1:27:00.980,1:27:08.59,it's terrible yeah I like to check in

1:27:04.430,1:27:08.59,with my peeps all the time now three and

1:27:08.650,1:27:15.95,yeah I I mean I use the dictionary on

1:27:12.260,1:27:21.77,here all the time because it's just so

1:27:15.950,1:27:24.23,much faster yeah elated so it's a tool

1:27:21.770,1:27:26.60,whether in whatever writing space you're

1:27:24.230,1:27:28.34,in is be it notebook or not you're still

1:27:26.600,1:27:31.91,using experience also assist you

1:27:28.340,1:27:34.37,yeah and I'm always I've always got

1:27:31.910,1:27:36.92,something going on that's like what you

1:27:34.370,1:27:42.14,know like right now and talking to

1:27:36.920,1:27:43.64,agents and if they email me if I see an

1:27:42.140,1:27:45.35,email come in while I'm actually working

1:27:43.640,1:27:47.59,on something I've got to go see with

1:27:45.350,1:27:52.76,that so that is that from my agent right

1:27:47.590,1:27:55.28,great um so present in that distraction

1:27:52.760,1:27:59.24,point of it's not a real concerns of you

1:27:55.280,1:28:01.61,and you see you are producing closes it

1:27:59.240,1:28:05.81,once more when I was younger but I guess

1:28:01.610,1:28:08.93,maybe I'm learning how to how'd it go

1:28:05.810,1:28:12.32,back and how to disconnect from it and

1:28:08.930,1:28:14.75,go back to my work pretty fast then has

1:28:12.320,1:28:16.64,there been something found to help do

1:28:14.750,1:28:17.96,that mean like what we need if you're

1:28:16.640,1:28:21.29,distinguishing between your younger

1:28:17.960,1:28:24.80,working and now I guess maybe just like

1:28:21.290,1:28:28.10,a lot of younger people I'm just more

1:28:24.800,1:28:30.11,used to being attached to it you know I

1:28:28.100,1:28:34.52,I'll have my I'll be doing something on

1:28:30.110,1:28:38.18,my iPad communicating with somebody or

1:28:34.520,1:28:42.10,talking on Facebook or whatever well

1:28:38.180,1:28:45.65,Rick and I are watching a movie at night

1:28:42.100,1:28:47.45,so I'm there's much more multitasking

1:28:45.650,1:28:54.41,sort of way to compartmentalize yeah

1:28:47.450,1:28:56.69,seems pretty seamless yeah when I guess

1:28:54.410,1:28:58.13,that's question about teaching like when

1:28:56.690,1:28:59.53,you when you've had now you're probably

1:28:58.130,1:29:02.23,getting students to groan

1:28:59.530,1:29:03.98,only with the computer right and that

1:29:02.239,1:29:05.71,changed your relationship to it I mean

1:29:03.980,1:29:08.48,has that sort of changed your idea about

1:29:05.710,1:29:08.77,what it does its effects anything like

1:29:08.480,1:29:13.96,that

1:29:08.770,1:29:18.19,well it's changed to the sense that and

1:29:13.960,1:29:20.63,when students talk to me about their own

1:29:18.190,1:29:22.85,composing process and of course they

1:29:20.630,1:29:25.42,they do everything on the computer they

1:29:22.850,1:29:28.13,don't they don't ever a lot of them

1:29:25.429,1:29:33.92,write anything at all in longhand yes I

1:29:28.130,1:29:36.94,don't even know if they can and and so I

1:29:33.920,1:29:41.92,I'm ok with that I feel like I've sort

1:29:36.949,1:29:46.04,of made my peace that they if people are

1:29:41.929,1:29:48.59,perfectly able to write to find a good

1:29:46.040,1:29:51.59,composition process that works for them

1:29:48.590,1:29:55.37,that doesn't have to do with paper and

1:29:51.590,1:29:57.50,pens at all and thought I'm accepting of

1:29:55.370,1:30:01.37,that you know I don't try to like shove

1:29:57.500,1:30:02.92,my process off or say to Phyllis have

1:30:01.370,1:30:05.87,you ever thought you might like to write

1:30:02.929,1:30:10.61,it on a piece of paper first let's know

1:30:05.870,1:30:12.86,why I know I know that I'm I'm hanging

1:30:10.610,1:30:17.51,onto something that's if you were to pen

1:30:12.860,1:30:19.55,the pan of the paper to me they have

1:30:17.510,1:30:21.50,some there's something else going on

1:30:19.550,1:30:24.86,between the eye and the hand and the

1:30:21.500,1:30:26.23,page you know yeah and I still feel that

1:30:24.860,1:30:27.77,when I'm working

1:30:26.239,1:30:29.21,especially on poems that there's

1:30:27.770,1:30:31.79,something happening between the eye and

1:30:29.210,1:30:34.31,the fingers and and the page that's very

1:30:31.790,1:30:37.16,tactile that eyes I'm hanging on to that

1:30:34.310,1:30:38.69,I like and so you so you would say read

1:30:37.160,1:30:40.40,it for those that are only composing on

1:30:38.690,1:30:42.05,the computer and not never going to

1:30:40.400,1:30:43.96,handwriting or never using handwriting

1:30:42.050,1:30:46.64,at all that's what they're missing that

1:30:43.969,1:30:48.80,sort of Andy I don't know I don't think

1:30:46.640,1:30:51.67,they necessarily are missing it I think

1:30:48.800,1:30:53.90,they've they probably learn or are

1:30:51.679,1:30:56.12,learning to a step in the composing

1:30:53.900,1:30:57.67,process you know that maybe that thing

1:30:56.120,1:31:00.71,where you're writing with your eyes

1:30:57.679,1:31:02.69,closed yeah I mean the sake but if they

1:31:00.710,1:31:06.25,grow up with that and so they get the

1:31:02.690,1:31:10.73,same whatever imaginative connection

1:31:06.250,1:31:15.71,with the keyboard do you find that there

1:31:10.730,1:31:28.43,as open to revision as maybe an older

1:31:15.710,1:31:32.03,student well they can be made to they

1:31:28.430,1:31:34.40,can make something and that's just part

1:31:32.030,1:31:35.72,of the learning process right you don't

1:31:34.400,1:31:39.19,think if anything distinct to this

1:31:35.720,1:31:42.74,generation no I think they just have too

1:31:39.190,1:31:46.97,many of them some of them get it right

1:31:42.740,1:31:49.16,away that that revising can actually

1:31:46.970,1:31:51.38,make a work better yeah you know I've

1:31:49.160,1:31:53.42,been working with this woman right now

1:31:51.380,1:31:56.06,who came in saying that she doesn't like

1:31:53.420,1:31:58.07,to revise because she likes to just sit

1:31:56.060,1:32:01.15,down write everything out really fast in

1:31:58.070,1:32:05.66,one big draft and her stuff is a mess

1:32:01.150,1:32:10.00,and so it's my personal mission with her

1:32:05.660,1:32:14.06,to help her to come to believe that

1:32:10.000,1:32:17.15,actually revising or working in some

1:32:14.060,1:32:21.02,other manner you know like maybe having

1:32:17.150,1:32:24.26,writing off scene at a time what would

1:32:21.020,1:32:27.65,benefit the work but she's very young

1:32:24.260,1:32:30.65,and her first she never she didn't even

1:32:27.650,1:32:31.61,have an undergraduate degree in the

1:32:30.650,1:32:34.84,writing fall

1:32:31.610,1:32:42.38,she's starting it yeah Claire one yeah

1:32:34.840,1:32:45.56,okay well so that's kind of discussion

1:32:42.380,1:32:47.24,to have her about the programs and but I

1:32:45.560,1:32:49.25,guess you have you have a number of

1:32:47.240,1:32:53.84,distinct indeed being a sort of primary

1:32:49.250,1:32:56.06,of computer assisted project but you

1:32:53.840,1:32:59.81,have several going at the same time

1:32:56.060,1:33:03.10,seems including the collected your

1:32:59.810,1:33:07.37,novella are there other projects as well

1:33:03.100,1:33:10.22,okay and are they are they supplanting

1:33:07.370,1:33:14.39,your fiction and poetry writing or are

1:33:10.220,1:33:16.64,they sort of just in addition to I am

1:33:14.390,1:33:21.32,wrestling with this question myself I

1:33:16.640,1:33:23.53,think poetry right now the new poetry is

1:33:21.320,1:33:27.65,kind of going into the

1:33:23.539,1:33:31.36,so these altered book pages done doing I

1:33:27.650,1:33:36.98,have four four of those projects going

1:33:31.369,1:33:44.42,on right now and I am working on a book

1:33:36.980,1:33:46.67,of regular poems of prose poems but the

1:33:44.420,1:33:51.67,all the fiction I'm working are all

1:33:46.670,1:33:53.90,ebooks now I just completed novella not

1:33:51.679,1:33:58.48,this one but a different one that's an

1:33:53.900,1:34:03.01,e-book that's in the form of a scrapbook

1:33:58.489,1:34:05.32,photograph album and that's that's the

1:34:03.019,1:34:09.46,one I'm kind of taught the agents about

1:34:05.329,1:34:11.84,okay and they're going to and you you

1:34:09.469,1:34:15.42,you have only you don't expect to see a

1:34:11.840,1:34:19.28,physical form at all either this is the

1:34:15.429,1:34:23.09,question that we are trying to work

1:34:19.280,1:34:27.94,through I don't care about seeing it as

1:34:23.090,1:34:29.98,a print book but apparently the

1:34:27.949,1:34:32.96,publishers don't want to take a book

1:34:29.989,1:34:34.09,unless they can also have it as a print

1:34:32.960,1:34:41.30,book because they don't make any money

1:34:34.099,1:34:43.96,on the ebooks so yeah so an agent

1:34:41.300,1:34:50.26,doesn't want to take me on at the client

1:34:43.969,1:34:54.55,unless I am doing the print book and the

1:34:50.269,1:34:57.01,e-book is a sort of bonus okay

1:34:54.559,1:34:58.76,so that's what we're kind of going

1:34:57.019,1:35:00.86,around and around about and then I think

1:34:58.760,1:35:01.03,well maybe I'll just go out there and do

1:35:00.860,1:35:04.78,it

1:35:01.039,1:35:06.92,Oh try to do it with an e-book publisher

1:35:04.789,1:35:11.80,who is just doing that so I'm just

1:35:06.920,1:35:13.88,trying I just I'm just this is all new

1:35:11.809,1:35:16.25,to me and I new territory and I'm just

1:35:13.880,1:35:18.80,trying to navigate it myself right now

1:35:16.250,1:35:21.46,I don't know what I'm doing yeah what is

1:35:18.800,1:35:23.03,in in terms of like the process and the

1:35:21.469,1:35:26.32,competition everything it still seems

1:35:23.030,1:35:28.28,pretty much you know computer mouse

1:35:26.329,1:35:29.57,computer that is so like account well I

1:35:28.280,1:35:32.67,mean the computer is a big part of this

1:35:29.570,1:35:34.98,but still writing the notebook enforcing

1:35:32.679,1:35:37.06,or is it a lot of that still happening

1:35:34.989,1:35:39.73,are the ebooks happening on the computer

1:35:37.060,1:35:45.07,no I'm storing the text part in the

1:35:39.730,1:35:47.98,notebook how does the sort of visual

1:35:45.070,1:35:52.51,aspect relate fact here writing

1:35:47.980,1:35:54.13,especially sort of maybe I mean you use

1:35:52.510,1:35:57.31,a lot of imagery in your poems in a

1:35:54.130,1:36:00.34,musician but now you're actually using

1:35:57.310,1:36:02.44,images so what's what's that what's that

1:36:00.340,1:36:04.71,feel like are you so using them in the

1:36:02.440,1:36:08.23,same way to use imagery or is it a

1:36:04.719,1:36:10.57,totally different well I mean you hit it

1:36:08.230,1:36:12.69,right on the head that's it exactly I

1:36:10.570,1:36:16.15,mean everything I loved about poetry

1:36:12.699,1:36:21.64,that you know the image things yes now

1:36:16.150,1:36:23.77,I'm making actual images and you know

1:36:21.640,1:36:28.81,I'm putting a little bit of text in

1:36:23.770,1:36:31.39,there and you know now I'm starting your

1:36:28.810,1:36:35.53,ruffle with well that's too much text

1:36:31.390,1:36:39.48,you know it's everything that's

1:36:35.530,1:36:42.94,happening now has gotten to be less less

1:36:39.489,1:36:44.71,and less tests yes trying I'm trying to

1:36:42.940,1:36:48.34,find the right balance between the

1:36:44.710,1:36:52.00,visual component on this on the piece

1:36:48.340,1:36:54.52,and certain that sort of means minimal

1:36:52.000,1:36:56.92,text I think yeah so that they don't

1:36:54.520,1:37:00.21,fight each other I mean so what is that

1:36:56.920,1:37:02.89,I mean what is like how do you find the

1:37:00.219,1:37:04.59,right language for that what sort is

1:37:02.890,1:37:07.09,that I mean that seems like a different

1:37:04.590,1:37:09.67,but different almost a different things

1:37:07.090,1:37:15.07,in writing poetry and yeah yeah and that

1:37:09.670,1:37:19.75,I mean see see see just this is what for

1:37:15.070,1:37:22.15,me when I turned 60 and I I'm doing this

1:37:19.750,1:37:25.71,work it's made it exciting again like

1:37:22.150,1:37:30.13,when I was 20 yeah because I am language

1:37:25.719,1:37:32.82,of Scott ins it's been refreshed by this

1:37:30.130,1:37:36.28,new sort of interjection of the actual

1:37:32.820,1:37:38.80,visual material in the same location

1:37:36.280,1:37:41.02,with the text and it's made it like a

1:37:38.800,1:37:43.90,brand new thing for me and just I don't

1:37:41.020,1:37:46.80,know I feel like oh good now I can get

1:37:43.900,1:37:50.59,through to my 80s okay and

1:37:46.800,1:37:51.73,being barred you didn't okay so what

1:37:50.590,1:37:53.11,kind of too far questions if you didn't

1:37:51.730,1:37:54.48,have that facility with the computer

1:37:53.110,1:37:57.58,that you have and that you developed

1:37:54.489,1:37:59.62,from working with pagemaker and or if

1:37:57.580,1:38:00.88,you just have not worked with in the

1:37:59.620,1:38:03.10,computer do you think you would have

1:38:00.880,1:38:05.77,turned to visual art in a physical

1:38:03.100,1:38:08.26,format but it's okay no it would have

1:38:05.770,1:38:11.26,been too much to learn I think I mean it
