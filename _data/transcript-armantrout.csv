start,end,line
0:00:00.030,0:00:08.21,these may not be virgins but I could

0:00:04.140,0:00:11.19,find versions how do you want to do that

0:00:08.210,0:00:12.99,well we can we can uh I think right now

0:00:11.190,0:00:15.03,we can just talk about it anything at

0:00:12.990,0:00:16.47,the end I've got a camera too I could

0:00:15.030,0:00:18.15,just take some pictures of that and then

0:00:16.470,0:00:20.16,have a kind of s photographs sure I

0:00:18.150,0:00:23.18,think it's probably the best okay the

0:00:20.160,0:00:25.38,best way so and then how do you save

0:00:23.189,0:00:28.71,your prewriting your notes there I mean

0:00:25.380,0:00:30.77,I have a bunch of these filling up my

0:00:28.710,0:00:34.07,shelves and when you know right now I

0:00:30.779,0:00:37.37,have way too many a couple of times I've

0:00:34.070,0:00:40.23,sold or donated my papers to archives

0:00:37.370,0:00:44.09,including Stanford and also at UC San

0:00:40.230,0:00:44.09,Diego and when I do I also include

0:00:46.969,0:00:52.71,hundreds maybe thousands okay is it do

0:00:50.610,0:00:56.34,you always go for like the same kind of

0:00:52.710,0:00:58.07,size or pretty much I like I like it to

0:00:56.340,0:01:00.39,be able to fit in my purse because I

0:00:58.079,0:01:03.42,take it with me and you know sometimes I

0:01:00.390,0:01:05.12,write at a cafe or you know someplace

0:01:03.420,0:01:07.08,out in the world so I want to be able to

0:01:05.129,0:01:09.47,stick it in my purse right right on the

0:01:07.080,0:01:11.13,airplane whatever you know so it's nice

0:01:09.479,0:01:13.65,if it's about this size and it's nice if

0:01:11.130,0:01:19.47,it's flexible okay and it's nice if it's

0:01:13.650,0:01:21.29,not expensive so in in terms of you

0:01:19.470,0:01:26.54,digital files what format you usually

0:01:21.299,0:01:28.17,work I dock it okay that's it as you're

0:01:26.549,0:01:30.75,working in those formats do you save

0:01:28.170,0:01:33.57,drafts of the individual documents or do

0:01:30.750,0:01:35.52,you save over those drafts you know I

0:01:33.570,0:01:35.88,mostly save over which is not a good

0:01:35.520,0:01:37.97,idea

0:01:35.880,0:01:41.31,but sometimes I have printed out drafts

0:01:37.979,0:01:43.25,and I I save drafts to is you know I

0:01:41.310,0:01:46.22,probably don't save all of them which is

0:01:43.250,0:01:48.11,not great but I save a number of them

0:01:46.229,0:01:50.97,and then eventually I'll probably give

0:01:48.119,0:01:52.95,them to the library and then you're

0:01:50.970,0:01:56.39,emailing them back yeah so that sort of

0:01:52.950,0:01:59.27,address so that also yeah and what are

0:01:56.399,0:02:01.53,your naming conventions for your files I

0:01:59.270,0:02:02.88,just named it I mean whatever the title

0:02:01.530,0:02:06.03,of the poem whatever the tiler

0:02:02.880,0:02:08.47,and then you know I don't I mean I I

0:02:06.030,0:02:11.06,number them sometimes I'll have you know

0:02:08.479,0:02:14.19,such and such a title one such and such

0:02:11.069,0:02:16.29,a title two such but when that gets too

0:02:14.190,0:02:19.26,confusing sometimes all just erase the

0:02:16.290,0:02:21.81,old ones so I'm not I'm not a very I'm

0:02:19.260,0:02:26.30,not a very good curator of my own

0:02:21.810,0:02:26.30,history yeah

0:02:30.030,0:02:36.69,do you back up anyway not as much as I

0:02:34.590,0:02:39.29,should I mean I backed I do have a

0:02:36.690,0:02:43.20,backup on a zip drive but I haven't

0:02:39.299,0:02:45.15,backed up for several months so I'm

0:02:43.200,0:02:48.18,careless and then when you're sending

0:02:45.150,0:02:50.70,these emails back and forth or is it

0:02:48.180,0:02:53.48,like a Gmail or some sort of yeah I'm

0:02:50.700,0:02:56.48,sorry I mean you could go back and find

0:02:53.489,0:02:58.56,them that way in some ways Esther so

0:02:56.489,0:03:01.38,you're not using a Dropbox or any other

0:02:58.560,0:03:03.69,cloud-based know I have Dropbox but I'm

0:03:01.380,0:03:05.70,not using it for this I'm using it for a

0:03:03.690,0:03:09.06,class that I'm teaching with someone

0:03:05.700,0:03:17.88,okay but I could use it that way I mean

0:03:09.060,0:03:19.65,it's something to think don't you have

0:03:17.880,0:03:26.97,you ever have files saved in more than

0:03:19.650,0:03:28.85,one location um no I mean I I well the

0:03:26.970,0:03:31.07,zip drive and a computer hard drive yeah

0:03:28.859,0:03:33.87,that would be it okay as well on paper

0:03:31.079,0:03:35.37,you know that would be it and then when

0:03:33.870,0:03:37.35,you're finished with the piece how do

0:03:35.370,0:03:43.95,you is there anything special that you

0:03:37.350,0:03:46.04,do for that file or no I pretty much you

0:03:43.950,0:03:49.31,know if I get I pretty much know what

0:03:46.049,0:03:51.09,just the finest final version mm-hmm and

0:03:49.319,0:03:52.95,if I start to get confused like I say I

0:03:51.090,0:04:00.76,just erased the others which is probably

0:03:52.950,0:04:03.32,a bad idea okay and then what about the

0:04:00.769,0:04:06.15,like the final like bird you like the

0:04:03.329,0:04:08.19,books in the what happened this is what

0:04:06.150,0:04:11.51,I do okay I'm gonna take these out

0:04:08.190,0:04:14.79,because these newspapers are not very

0:04:11.519,0:04:15.87,significant those are rough copies that

0:04:14.790,0:04:17.37,I took with

0:04:15.870,0:04:20.76,to give a reading somewhere so that's

0:04:17.370,0:04:22.88,why they're loose okay but um this is

0:04:20.760,0:04:25.88,the manuscript that I'm working on now

0:04:22.889,0:04:27.96,and so I did a really old fashioned

0:04:25.889,0:04:30.12,these are called thesis binders this one

0:04:27.960,0:04:31.74,is all beaten up but you can't really

0:04:30.120,0:04:33.84,even buy them used to be able to buy

0:04:31.740,0:04:37.13,them in stationary stores yeah Lenard

0:04:33.840,0:04:38.85,Union in Berkeley knows that I guess she

0:04:37.139,0:04:40.13,has a whole bunch of them I don't think

0:04:38.850,0:04:41.63,you mean she can get them anymore but

0:04:40.139,0:04:43.97,she doesn't use them anymore and she has

0:04:41.639,0:04:45.84,a big stack so she sends them to me so

0:04:43.979,0:04:49.62,this is a really old school but the way

0:04:45.840,0:04:51.30,I use it is um it helps me order that

0:04:49.620,0:04:53.72,not only keep the poems for the

0:04:51.300,0:04:56.97,manuscript but i order the manuscript

0:04:53.729,0:05:01.16,this way i mean i kind of decide how you

0:04:56.970,0:05:03.15,know what reads well by you know trying

0:05:01.169,0:05:06.03,the poems out in different places yeah

0:05:03.150,0:05:07.44,within this manuscript so that i don't

0:05:06.030,0:05:09.90,do that thing that you hear about

0:05:07.440,0:05:11.72,writers doing about spreading the pages

0:05:09.900,0:05:13.05,all over the floor or all over the wall

0:05:11.729,0:05:15.81,or something because I've already been

0:05:13.050,0:05:19.11,deciding as I went along by where I

0:05:15.810,0:05:21.81,placed them in this binder and so will

0:05:19.110,0:05:24.47,you be working on many poems at the same

0:05:21.810,0:05:27.87,time no not usually

0:05:24.479,0:05:29.58,um almost never I'm kind of you know

0:05:27.870,0:05:31.53,obsessive when I started something I

0:05:29.580,0:05:33.15,just work on it till I finish it I mean

0:05:31.530,0:05:35.61,once in a while I give up on something

0:05:33.150,0:05:36.84,for a while and set it aside and go into

0:05:35.610,0:05:39.81,something else and then go back to it

0:05:36.840,0:05:44.03,yeah but I'm not actively working on two

0:05:39.810,0:05:46.41,things at a time okay and so just to

0:05:44.039,0:05:48.38,kind of be clear then so if you finished

0:05:46.410,0:05:49.68,a piece you would then go to your you

0:05:48.389,0:05:51.59,would print it out and then take it to

0:05:49.680,0:05:53.63,this PC monitor put it in into place

0:05:51.599,0:05:55.38,where you think it may fit the rest that

0:05:53.639,0:05:57.38,are that are working and then and then

0:05:55.380,0:05:59.47,once you have what you would how do you

0:05:57.389,0:06:04.53,know when you have a collection then

0:05:59.479,0:06:06.15,well um it used to be that I had a

0:06:04.530,0:06:09.27,collection when I had enough poems for a

0:06:06.150,0:06:12.41,book but it seems as if I'm writing more

0:06:09.270,0:06:15.41,now so I get to make some more choices I

0:06:12.419,0:06:18.03,get to you know cut things kind of

0:06:15.419,0:06:20.84,manuscript down and save some things for

0:06:18.030,0:06:23.94,later so I get to make some decisions

0:06:20.849,0:06:26.94,about how the poems work with each other

0:06:23.940,0:06:28.81,and it's kind of intuitive you know how

0:06:26.940,0:06:31.64,they

0:06:28.819,0:06:33.53,today did they have a do these poems

0:06:31.649,0:06:35.66,have a particular tone and maybe when I

0:06:33.539,0:06:37.91,get to the end of the manuscript I think

0:06:35.669,0:06:39.62,that there are some poems that seem to

0:06:37.919,0:06:43.81,lead in a new direction I set those

0:06:39.629,0:06:43.81,aside to be the start of something new

0:06:45.319,0:06:49.86,have you ever received or sought out

0:06:47.789,0:06:56.66,information about methods for digitally

0:06:49.860,0:06:58.90,archiving your work no and I think we

0:06:56.669,0:07:00.95,covered we did cover I think kind of the

0:06:58.909,0:07:04.64,nuts and bolts of your current practice

0:07:00.959,0:07:06.98,that's good so in this section we're

0:07:04.649,0:07:09.68,gonna kind of talk about sort of three

0:07:06.989,0:07:11.21,areas of your writing and how then talk

0:07:09.689,0:07:15.05,about the different stages those went

0:07:11.219,0:07:17.71,through and changing over the course the

0:07:15.050,0:07:19.94,and these are you know my sort of

0:07:17.719,0:07:21.14,definitions my sort of boxes so if they

0:07:19.949,0:07:22.73,don't work for you just let me know but

0:07:21.149,0:07:24.36,I sort of want to talk about the kind of

0:07:22.739,0:07:27.08,compositional generative prewriting

0:07:24.360,0:07:29.30,place and then the revision plates and

0:07:27.089,0:07:32.27,then kind of organizational archival

0:07:29.309,0:07:35.27,places a little smaller at the end those

0:07:32.279,0:07:38.87,work with you okay so how long have you

0:07:35.279,0:07:47.09,been writing professionally question

0:07:38.879,0:07:49.01,well you know um proposed is a card

0:07:47.099,0:07:51.36,question yeah how long have you been

0:07:49.019,0:07:54.02,taking it seriously yeah maybe that's a

0:07:51.360,0:07:58.55,better yeah having it since I was a

0:07:54.029,0:08:00.95,senior in college really okay I I think

0:07:58.559,0:08:02.69,I had my first poem published in a

0:08:00.959,0:08:07.05,national magazine shortly after I

0:08:02.699,0:08:09.08,graduated from college and then I I just

0:08:07.050,0:08:10.86,continued to publish in magazines I had

0:08:09.089,0:08:11.69,Mike my first book was published when I

0:08:10.860,0:08:13.64,was 3,
0:08:11.699,0:08:17.27,mm-hm and I've been publishing books

0:08:13.649,0:08:19.88,ever since and I suppose that now you

0:08:17.279,0:08:22.43,could say or for you know when would it

0:08:19.889,0:08:26.57,if by professional you mean somebody who

0:08:22.439,0:08:32.39,actually you know makes money and has a

0:08:26.579,0:08:38.32,reputation I guess I've been in that

0:08:32.399,0:08:38.32,category baby for 25 years or something

0:08:39.110,0:08:43.88,for poet yeah

0:08:41.660,0:08:45.26,would you please describe kind of the

0:08:43.880,0:08:51.05,arc of your career like where you

0:08:45.260,0:08:53.78,started and I would I would say all

0:08:51.050,0:08:55.16,right let me hear who it is probably I

0:08:53.780,0:08:59.99,don't need to answer it but if it's

0:08:55.160,0:09:01.66,someone I really want to talk to bad

0:08:59.990,0:09:04.79,timing

0:09:01.660,0:09:08.78,it ought to pick up after this or maybe

0:09:04.790,0:09:11.36,they'll give up because I didn't answer

0:09:08.780,0:09:17.93,it's probably probably a sales call

0:09:11.360,0:09:19.46,anyway yeah okay so if you wouldn't mind

0:09:17.930,0:09:20.96,describing kind of the arc of your

0:09:19.460,0:09:23.51,career from when you've started sort of

0:09:20.960,0:09:26.30,seriously writing until now there's a

0:09:23.510,0:09:29.33,general overview so you know the

0:09:26.300,0:09:32.23,interview all right um I was interested

0:09:29.330,0:09:37.40,in poetry since childhood

0:09:32.230,0:09:38.87,my mother read poetry to me I wrote when

0:09:37.400,0:09:41.36,I was a little kid that kind of stopped

0:09:38.870,0:09:44.66,for a while and then I started again in

0:09:41.360,0:09:45.59,college and I was reading the poet

0:09:44.660,0:09:47.24,Denise lever top

0:09:45.590,0:09:49.10,oh I start I grew up here in San Diego

0:09:47.240,0:09:51.62,actually and I went to San Diego State

0:09:49.100,0:09:52.88,for two years and I was reading the poet

0:09:51.620,0:09:54.20,Denise never table and then I

0:09:52.880,0:09:56.39,transferred to Berkeley and she was

0:09:54.200,0:10:01.67,teaching here so I took a class with her

0:09:56.390,0:10:03.95,and sure that experience I met my friend

0:10:01.670,0:10:06.56,Ron silliman who's a poet the one I send

0:10:03.950,0:10:10.49,poems to who's still a friend of mine

0:10:06.560,0:10:12.14,and then I came back here and then I

0:10:10.490,0:10:14.33,moved to San Francisco to go to grad

0:10:12.140,0:10:16.31,school I think he was living there and

0:10:14.330,0:10:19.28,through him and also through the grad

0:10:16.310,0:10:21.71,program I met other poets and there was

0:10:19.280,0:10:23.57,you know San Francisco's a good literary

0:10:21.710,0:10:28.52,town so there was quite a community of

0:10:23.570,0:10:33.17,poets in San Francisco and I eventually

0:10:28.520,0:10:35.20,was friends with poets who became came

0:10:33.170,0:10:38.36,to be known as the broad language poets

0:10:35.200,0:10:40.97,scare quotes the West Coast language

0:10:38.360,0:10:43.55,poets anyway which would include Barrett

0:10:40.970,0:10:48.17,Lawton and Bob Perlman and linha ginyan

0:10:43.550,0:10:52.04,and KITT Robinson and Ron Shulman and

0:10:48.170,0:10:54.28,Carla Herriman among others and you know

0:10:52.040,0:10:55.39,I went to a lot of reading series and

0:10:54.280,0:11:01.00,participated

0:10:55.390,0:11:04.81,in small press publications and had a

0:11:01.000,0:11:06.64,very active literary life and like I

0:11:04.810,0:11:10.06,said published in magazines and journals

0:11:06.640,0:11:12.70,and that my first publisher was someone

0:11:10.060,0:11:14.59,that we knew there it was called the

0:11:12.700,0:11:17.59,figures press and his name was Jeff

0:11:14.590,0:11:19.66,young and so that book came out in an

0:11:17.590,0:11:22.63,edition of you know very small press an

0:11:19.660,0:11:24.76,edition of 500 copies which I a lot I

0:11:22.630,0:11:29.17,gave a lot of them away to my friends

0:11:24.760,0:11:31.03,and such and then um at the end of the

0:11:29.170,0:11:34.36,70s this was in the seventies it's at

0:11:31.030,0:11:35.74,the end of the 70s I got pregnant and it

0:11:34.360,0:11:37.45,just didn't seem like we were going to

0:11:35.740,0:11:40.63,be able to afford to keep living in San

0:11:37.450,0:11:42.34,Francisco and raise a kid because kind

0:11:40.630,0:11:44.86,of like now I guess it's more extreme

0:11:42.340,0:11:47.14,now but you know there was there was

0:11:44.860,0:11:48.79,gentrification and yep efficient going

0:11:47.140,0:11:50.41,on then and suddenly the rents were

0:11:48.790,0:11:53.41,getting out of reach for us especially

0:11:50.410,0:11:54.94,if we had a kid because you can't be so

0:11:53.410,0:11:57.40,hand-to-mouth with the kid and then my

0:11:54.940,0:12:00.82,my mother lived here and was willing to

0:11:57.400,0:12:03.34,babysit and also Chuck got an offer of a

0:12:00.820,0:12:04.84,job here that would have benefits and

0:12:03.340,0:12:06.82,health insurance and all so we ended up

0:12:04.840,0:12:09.64,back here I was not very happy to come

0:12:06.820,0:12:12.31,back here because then and this is going

0:12:09.640,0:12:14.20,to get to a topic you like then that was

0:12:12.310,0:12:16.15,really isolating because that was before

0:12:14.200,0:12:20.17,email right yeah that was you know that

0:12:16.150,0:12:22.51,was even before I had a computer so it

0:12:20.170,0:12:24.70,just felt like you know kind of falling

0:12:22.510,0:12:27.01,off a cliff I mean there were some poets

0:12:24.700,0:12:29.05,here and I got to know them gradually

0:12:27.010,0:12:33.31,there is Jerome Rothenberg and David

0:12:29.050,0:12:35.92,Anton and Michael Davidson but um not

0:12:33.310,0:12:40.69,that many people in my generation really

0:12:35.920,0:12:43.42,and so I I had link see correspondences

0:12:40.690,0:12:45.16,actually on paper with the people back

0:12:43.420,0:12:48.52,in San Francisco not all of them but

0:12:45.160,0:12:50.08,some of them I can't believe it now how

0:12:48.520,0:12:51.79,much time we spent writing long letters

0:12:50.080,0:12:54.07,out by hand or typing them on

0:12:51.790,0:12:55.72,typewriters yeah it seems surreal now

0:12:54.070,0:12:58.21,that everything goes so fast I mean who

0:12:55.720,0:13:01.41,would do that but we did and so some of

0:12:58.210,0:13:06.76,those letters are in archives you know

0:13:01.410,0:13:08.25,and meanwhile I kept sending work out to

0:13:06.760,0:13:11.94,to journals

0:13:08.250,0:13:14.34,and our Leonard Jeanine in the Bay Area

0:13:11.940,0:13:15.99,at a small press and she published on my

0:13:14.340,0:13:19.65,second book which was a chat book called

0:13:15.990,0:13:23.54,the invention of hunger you know it was

0:13:19.650,0:13:29.76,true but tu um be a kind of uh you know

0:13:23.540,0:13:31.41,letterpress press and then my third book

0:13:29.760,0:13:33.48,which was my second full-length book was

0:13:31.410,0:13:36.51,published by burning deck and Providence

0:13:33.480,0:13:39.09,so that was my first kind of you know

0:13:36.510,0:13:43.50,outside my immediate coterie yeah

0:13:39.090,0:13:45.81,publication still a small press but and

0:13:43.500,0:13:48.69,then I started publishing with the Los

0:13:45.810,0:13:53.73,Angeles publisher Sun and Moon who also

0:13:48.690,0:13:59.49,published people like within Virginian

0:13:53.730,0:14:03.03,and Charles Bernstein and you know was

0:13:59.490,0:14:06.87,oh they're a very active precedence it

0:14:03.030,0:14:09.54,changed he changed it to green integer

0:14:06.870,0:14:12.24,and I do have a book out uncreated or

0:14:09.540,0:14:15.81,two but the focus became for him became

0:14:12.240,0:14:18.69,more republishing classics that had you

0:14:15.810,0:14:20.75,know gone off copyright so about that

0:14:18.690,0:14:20.75,time

0:14:21.200,0:14:28.95,fortuitously I got picked up by Wesleyan

0:14:23.670,0:14:31.23,and time I was already fairly well known

0:14:28.950,0:14:34.11,at least in the kind of small press

0:14:31.230,0:14:36.12,world I'd been in some anthologies but I

0:14:34.110,0:14:39.03,think that being published by Wesleyan

0:14:36.120,0:14:43.05,and having a selected come out with him

0:14:39.030,0:14:47.07,in 2001 really kind of gave my career so

0:14:43.050,0:14:50.31,to speak a boost and Kings have just

0:14:47.070,0:14:54.72,picked up since then including my pace

0:14:50.310,0:14:56.97,of writing so that since 2001 in 2001 I

0:14:54.720,0:14:59.43,published two books I published one with

0:14:56.970,0:15:02.13,green integer and called the pretext and

0:14:59.430,0:15:04.92,then the selected with Western which is

0:15:02.130,0:15:09.36,called veil and then in 2004 I had up to

0:15:04.920,0:15:14.04,speed in 2007 I had next life and 2009 I

0:15:09.360,0:15:17.22,had a burst in 2011 I had money shot and

0:15:14.040,0:15:21.27,then in 13 I had just singing so yeah a

0:15:17.220,0:15:23.58,spurt yeah that's great and

0:15:21.270,0:15:26.85,during that time were you supporting

0:15:23.580,0:15:30.06,yourself by teaching yeah when we first

0:15:26.850,0:15:32.19,came down here Chuck was one of the

0:15:30.060,0:15:36.30,managers of the bookstore at San Diego

0:15:32.190,0:15:38.64,State and I got about a year after we

0:15:36.300,0:15:42.03,got here I got a part-time teaching job

0:15:38.640,0:15:43.80,at UC San Diego and at first it was kind

0:15:42.030,0:15:48.99,of on and off and then after that it was

0:15:43.800,0:15:52.34,regular but adjunct and I did that for

0:15:48.990,0:15:57.18,many years it wasn't until the early

0:15:52.340,0:16:03.18,2000s that I got a you know real tender

0:15:57.180,0:16:04.65,job at at UCSD so I guess we want to

0:16:03.180,0:16:06.75,kind of move into talking about the

0:16:04.650,0:16:09.18,different properties of different spots

0:16:06.750,0:16:10.56,of processes for you and how it changed

0:16:09.180,0:16:12.54,over the course of your career so in

0:16:10.560,0:16:15.29,terms of like when you first started

0:16:12.540,0:16:17.43,writing seriously and we're kind of

0:16:15.290,0:16:19.02,doing the prewriting the generating work

0:16:17.430,0:16:20.31,for these poems how did well how did

0:16:19.020,0:16:22.98,that look like I mean what was what was

0:16:20.310,0:16:25.95,the process for that well I think I

0:16:22.980,0:16:28.02,always used to notebook um I you know I

0:16:25.950,0:16:29.76,I mean I couldn't tell you exactly what

0:16:28.020,0:16:32.58,the notebooks look like way back send

0:16:29.760,0:16:36.11,but I always wrote by hand I think I

0:16:32.580,0:16:39.03,wrote by hand then I'm sure I did longer

0:16:36.110,0:16:41.03,it took me longer to write a poem and it

0:16:39.030,0:16:43.92,also stayed in the handwritten phase

0:16:41.030,0:16:45.33,longer because back then when you left

0:16:43.920,0:16:47.10,the handwritten says you had to go to a

0:16:45.330,0:16:48.36,typewriter you're too young to know

0:16:47.100,0:16:50.61,about typewriters but they were

0:16:48.360,0:16:51.96,enormously irritating because if you

0:16:50.610,0:16:54.39,made any mistakes you had to either

0:16:51.960,0:16:58.68,start over or put wite-out on it or you

0:16:54.390,0:17:00.15,know etc and then you would make you

0:16:58.680,0:17:01.98,know I'll cough I mean you would you

0:17:00.150,0:17:03.15,would print it out and then if you

0:17:01.980,0:17:05.16,wanted another coffee you would have to

0:17:03.150,0:17:09.30,type it again and I'm gonna write so I

0:17:05.160,0:17:10.98,mean there's a limit to that um so you

0:17:09.300,0:17:13.53,would you know you would kind of just do

0:17:10.980,0:17:16.17,that when you thought you had a pretty

0:17:13.530,0:17:19.08,much finished version you might be wrong

0:17:16.170,0:17:20.73,but you know yeah still when you were

0:17:19.080,0:17:23.04,working in the notebook was it usually

0:17:20.730,0:17:25.23,in a certain spot or could that be

0:17:23.040,0:17:27.30,wherever you were whether it just well I

0:17:25.230,0:17:30.72,did it a lot at home but sometimes

0:17:27.300,0:17:33.06,outside and was it something where you

0:17:30.720,0:17:33.97,just certain had a had a line or an idea

0:17:33.060,0:17:36.34,that then you would

0:17:33.970,0:17:42.37,right down yeah I mean I often start

0:17:36.340,0:17:44.98,that way then and still you know I can

0:17:42.370,0:17:47.67,just something that I hear or see sort

0:17:44.980,0:17:49.24,of piques my interest it could be

0:17:47.679,0:17:51.54,something I read and I'll write down the

0:17:49.240,0:17:54.01,passage or I'll write down something I

0:17:51.549,0:17:55.33,overhear someone say or even on

0:17:54.010,0:17:59.23,television you know I could hear

0:17:55.330,0:18:00.85,something that I write down and I could

0:17:59.230,0:18:03.30,you know collect those things like a

0:18:00.850,0:18:05.67,magpie until something starts to take

0:18:03.309,0:18:07.05,off okay and in the sort of in the

0:18:05.679,0:18:09.49,beginning part of their career then how

0:18:07.059,0:18:11.14,at what point would you go to the

0:18:09.490,0:18:12.46,typewriter like when would you kind of

0:18:11.140,0:18:16.78,feel like okay this really needs to be

0:18:12.460,0:18:18.76,typed well I guess when I thought it was

0:18:16.780,0:18:20.79,good enough to keep and good enough to

0:18:18.760,0:18:22.33,maybe send a copy to someone to see what

0:18:20.799,0:18:25.41,they thought either an editor or a

0:18:22.330,0:18:28.57,friend so that's pretty far along yeah

0:18:25.419,0:18:31.84,so would you were you doing revisions

0:18:28.570,0:18:33.78,within the notebook as well and our what

0:18:31.840,0:18:35.40,type of revisions would did it sort of

0:18:33.789,0:18:37.17,start as I mean was it like would you

0:18:35.409,0:18:37.78,just be crossing out and rewriting or

0:18:37.179,0:18:39.54,would you

0:18:37.780,0:18:41.04,III don't know if I would cross out I

0:18:39.549,0:18:46.80,think I would just you know go to

0:18:41.049,0:18:49.24,another page and rewrite okay and then

0:18:46.809,0:18:52.84,so when did the computer start to enter

0:18:49.240,0:19:00.82,into this process um let's see when did

0:18:52.840,0:19:02.40,I first get a computer um the first

0:19:00.820,0:19:04.99,thing I got was one of those IBM

0:19:02.409,0:19:06.58,Selectric that was sort of computer on

0:19:04.990,0:19:08.47,yeah where you could make and now you

0:19:06.580,0:19:11.89,could save and make a number of copies

0:19:08.470,0:19:13.92,but shortly after I got that I was able

0:19:11.890,0:19:17.79,to get my first computers or that became

0:19:13.929,0:19:20.20,sort of redundant instantly I'm trying

0:19:17.799,0:19:24.64,to think what year it was I mean it was

0:19:20.200,0:19:28.36,probably only when did you tell me when

0:19:24.640,0:19:30.52,two desktops with with word processing

0:19:28.360,0:19:34.57,become available it wasn't a word it was

0:19:30.520,0:19:38.67,like Word Perfect or word yeah mid

0:19:34.570,0:19:40.49,eighties maybe lady maybe I think I got

0:19:38.679,0:19:43.04,this electric in the mid 8,
0:19:40.490,0:19:46.58,maybe you know I probably got the

0:19:43.040,0:19:48.38,computer by the late 80s and I don't

0:19:46.580,0:19:49.85,think I got internet until there wasn't

0:19:48.380,0:19:52.70,internet that you can get in till the

0:19:49.850,0:19:53.90,early 90s probably incredible now thank

0:19:52.700,0:19:56.09,you

0:19:53.900,0:19:58.61,how did so how did how did that first

0:19:56.090,0:20:00.05,computer come about I mean did you know

0:19:58.610,0:20:03.08,a friend who had a computer and then go

0:20:00.050,0:20:05.66,after that or yeah I think go again Ron

0:20:03.080,0:20:07.97,silliman who worked in the computer

0:20:05.660,0:20:09.32,industry he worked as an as a marketer

0:20:07.970,0:20:12.02,in the computer industry

0:20:09.320,0:20:13.64,he had one I mean he doesn't he didn't

0:20:12.020,0:20:15.98,live near me at that point but we were

0:20:13.640,0:20:19.19,in touch and he had one before I did but

0:20:15.980,0:20:20.36,I guess you know really I mean everyone

0:20:19.190,0:20:21.37,was getting it at about the same time

0:20:20.360,0:20:25.19,mm-hmm

0:20:21.370,0:20:27.17,and then when when you so you've got a

0:20:25.190,0:20:29.00,computer did it have an immediate effect

0:20:27.170,0:20:30.11,on your practice did it start did it

0:20:29.000,0:20:33.47,start to integrate with what you were

0:20:30.110,0:20:35.66,doing aye-aye-aye

0:20:33.470,0:20:37.82,I don't remember I mean I guess it was

0:20:35.660,0:20:40.48,gradual I still like I say work in

0:20:37.820,0:20:43.25,notebooks but I'm sure that I started I

0:20:40.480,0:20:45.41,started going from the notebook to the

0:20:43.250,0:20:47.15,computer sooner than I would have on a

0:20:45.410,0:20:49.40,typewriter I'm sure but I don't have a

0:20:47.150,0:20:52.40,clear memory of it what I do have a

0:20:49.400,0:20:58.00,clear memory of is how the internet

0:20:52.400,0:21:00.35,changed things because then you could

0:20:58.000,0:21:02.45,send someone something and say what do

0:21:00.350,0:21:03.98,you think I don't know about this last

0:21:02.450,0:21:04.85,line what do you think you know I mean

0:21:03.980,0:21:07.19,you can have that kind of conversation

0:21:04.850,0:21:09.14,and if you do that in a letter which I

0:21:07.190,0:21:10.70,did but you know by the time you've got

0:21:09.140,0:21:14.60,letter back you'd already made up your

0:21:10.700,0:21:16.04,mind right right so in the early part

0:21:14.600,0:21:17.84,when you were sending these by letters

0:21:16.040,0:21:20.18,you did that only a little bit and then

0:21:17.840,0:21:22.13,didn't do I think I did it I mean I

0:21:20.180,0:21:24.95,would I would type something up and send

0:21:22.130,0:21:26.54,it and I would you know usually to a

0:21:24.950,0:21:29.54,couple of people two or three people and

0:21:26.540,0:21:31.76,I would get responses back um but it

0:21:29.540,0:21:34.16,certainly I mean we're now we're so used

0:21:31.760,0:21:38.39,to kind of this instant dialogue and

0:21:34.160,0:21:40.01,instant gratification sometimes I think

0:21:38.390,0:21:42.88,that that's you know maybe that's why

0:21:40.010,0:21:47.48,I'm writing faster now yeah it is this

0:21:42.880,0:21:48.68,stimulation of that because I'm I'm

0:21:47.480,0:21:53.11,still not

0:21:48.680,0:21:54.88,I guess I'm insecure enough that I

0:21:53.110,0:21:57.52,not comfortable in saying something's

0:21:54.880,0:21:58.99,finished until somebody has said that

0:21:57.520,0:22:01.00,they at least think it's interesting I

0:21:58.990,0:22:02.74,mean it doesn't always have to be Ron

0:22:01.000,0:22:04.99,sometimes I send it to somebody else but

0:22:02.740,0:22:07.29,I have to have like somebody's approval

0:22:04.990,0:22:09.40,not a hundred percent approval but like

0:22:07.299,0:22:10.03,somebody has to think oh you know this

0:22:09.400,0:22:12.46,is okay

0:22:10.030,0:22:14.67,yeah before I like decide that I'll put

0:22:12.460,0:22:16.36,it in the book and so that's sort of an

0:22:14.679,0:22:18.76,integral part of the process so

0:22:16.360,0:22:22.39,obviously if you could do that and get

0:22:18.760,0:22:25.39,an answer in a day or two well yeah

0:22:22.390,0:22:27.70,right now then you know then I decide

0:22:25.390,0:22:31.78,whether at that point whether I still

0:22:27.700,0:22:33.82,need to revise you know so in the like

0:22:31.780,0:22:35.59,when the internet first starts coming

0:22:33.820,0:22:37.66,and you start working and kind of

0:22:35.590,0:22:39.82,sending these things back and forth was

0:22:37.660,0:22:42.22,it just for on Suliman who was your know

0:22:39.820,0:22:45.33,are you i usually there i used to send

0:22:42.220,0:22:50.44,them to more people live in her ginyan

0:22:45.330,0:22:52.78,at first and Bob Pearlman at first Lydia

0:22:50.440,0:22:57.39,Lydia Davis the fiction writer she's a

0:22:52.780,0:22:57.39,friend of mine and later Fanny how-to

0:22:58.110,0:23:03.46,now I mostly just send them to Ron and

0:23:02.049,0:23:06.07,once in a while to Lydia

0:23:03.460,0:23:07.80,very rarely to Linda genuine but still

0:23:06.070,0:23:10.45,once in a while like maybe twice a year

0:23:07.809,0:23:13.15,so it's kind of that number of people

0:23:10.450,0:23:15.19,has sort of shrunk and what's what's the

0:23:13.150,0:23:17.77,like so you're looking for some sort of

0:23:15.190,0:23:20.91,affirmation oh yeah I guess so yeah yeah

0:23:17.770,0:23:23.20,and do they give I mean what do they

0:23:20.919,0:23:24.61,give like very specific line feedback or

0:23:23.200,0:23:27.70,they usually just give what's wrong

0:23:24.610,0:23:30.16,LeBron does I mean it you know I could

0:23:27.700,0:23:32.71,show you I mean just I guess just a kind

0:23:30.160,0:23:36.88,of my screens dirty but this is the kind

0:23:32.710,0:23:40.35,of thing you might want to see um so let

0:23:36.880,0:23:40.35,me go to my mail and then I'll go to my

0:23:40.559,0:23:47.49,sent mail and you can see some of this

0:23:51.790,0:23:54.62,this actually has to do with the

0:23:53.990,0:24:00.83,Internet

0:23:54.620,0:24:02.99,I sent Ron a poem that mentions messages

0:24:00.830,0:24:05.48,I was kidding just actually in the poem

0:24:02.990,0:24:09.97,from my liege calm that I thought were

0:24:05.480,0:24:17.00,funny so well so Ron writes back

0:24:09.970,0:24:19.61,oh no he said oh yeah he said not sure

0:24:17.000,0:24:22.67,you knew you need the Q&A at the end I

0:24:19.610,0:24:25.34,had a sort of interviewing myself but at

0:24:22.670,0:24:27.50,the end not sure you need the Q&A at the

0:24:25.340,0:24:30.71,end but other than the problems with the

0:24:27.500,0:24:32.66,URL he thought that it was that since I

0:24:30.710,0:24:36.08,was saying mileage calm which he says is

0:24:32.660,0:24:37.79,a phishing site yeah he thought that if

0:24:36.080,0:24:40.01,that was ever published in an online

0:24:37.790,0:24:42.50,journal and somebody kid on it clicked

0:24:40.010,0:24:44.63,it that I could be in trouble for that

0:24:42.500,0:24:46.34,which I don't know if that's true he

0:24:44.630,0:24:48.41,says you know that mileage calm is a

0:24:46.340,0:24:52.31,phishing site it sends malware to your

0:24:48.410,0:24:53.99,PC if you follow through and then I at

0:24:52.310,0:24:58.22,some point wrote back and said I I don't

0:24:53.990,0:25:02.27,do that and so you know that's the some

0:24:58.220,0:25:04.16,of the kinds of so so there I am there

0:25:02.270,0:25:08.35,there I am sending something to him and

0:25:04.160,0:25:08.35,having a correspondence with him and

0:25:09.970,0:25:15.86,Here I am sending somebody to myself

0:25:12.170,0:25:17.60,just to kind of preserve it same poem

0:25:15.860,0:25:19.43,that has a different title at that point

0:25:17.600,0:25:21.95,there's mileage coml it up

0:25:19.430,0:25:24.05,oh yeah and yeah cuz it lights up if you

0:25:21.950,0:25:26.72,do it doesn't on my computer but it does

0:25:24.050,0:25:30.32,if you do it that well yeah so did you

0:25:26.720,0:25:32.06,write that on your iPad well I mean I

0:25:30.320,0:25:34.01,said like always I started here and then

0:25:32.060,0:25:36.53,I moved it to the iPad and then I moved

0:25:34.010,0:25:40.43,it to the computer but but I was sending

0:25:36.530,0:25:42.11,I think um I start writing usually right

0:25:40.430,0:25:43.73,I write in the morning sitting over

0:25:42.110,0:25:45.50,there and I don't want to be running up

0:25:43.730,0:25:47.15,and down stairs so I'm apt to just go

0:25:45.500,0:25:49.88,you know this looks good enough to kind

0:25:47.150,0:25:52.79,of type so I'll type it here mm-hmm and

0:25:49.880,0:25:53.96,if I if I don't yet feel like sharing it

0:25:52.790,0:25:56.11,with someone I'll just send it to myself

0:25:53.960,0:26:00.11,because that's a way of saving it

0:25:56.110,0:26:08.11,yeah and so when did you start using the

0:26:00.110,0:26:11.00,iPad um gee again I got an iPhone maybe

0:26:08.110,0:26:12.05,three years ago and I got the iPad maybe

0:26:11.000,0:26:16.22,two years ago

0:26:12.050,0:26:17.87,I don't know time to blur okay it's an

0:26:16.220,0:26:20.63,old one though so it's been a couple

0:26:17.870,0:26:23.24,years two or three years did you ever

0:26:20.630,0:26:29.21,work on the iPhone do you know - Tony -

0:26:23.240,0:26:31.30,smaller typing do so then I guess back

0:26:29.210,0:26:36.32,to the sort of revision sort of

0:26:31.300,0:26:37.58,correspondence do you think that why do

0:26:36.320,0:26:41.51,you think Ron Sulaiman has kind of been

0:26:37.580,0:26:44.45,the constant of all that well because

0:26:41.510,0:26:46.28,he's very confident about what he says

0:26:44.450,0:26:49.28,first of all and he's also very specific

0:26:46.280,0:26:50.93,mm-hmm he doesn't always say why he

0:26:49.280,0:26:52.73,thinks what he thinks which drives me

0:26:50.930,0:26:56.03,crazy but it gives me something to

0:26:52.730,0:26:58.88,bounce off yeah and is he is he very

0:26:56.030,0:26:59.69,prompt in responding often not always

0:26:58.880,0:27:01.25,okay

0:26:59.690,0:27:02.93,sometimes it's ride away sometimes it's

0:27:01.250,0:27:05.36,not reduced depends on how busy he is

0:27:02.930,0:27:07.52,yeah yeah and does he reciprocate as he

0:27:05.360,0:27:09.95,send you things he never has he doesn't

0:27:07.520,0:27:12.14,like to do that other people have so you

0:27:09.950,0:27:13.97,know that's fine with me but um I mean

0:27:12.140,0:27:17.14,he might really really long kind of book

0:27:13.970,0:27:19.76,links things hmm and he doesn't revise

0:27:17.140,0:27:22.10,much he doesn't revised like I do so

0:27:19.760,0:27:24.98,yeah um he just has a different kind of

0:27:22.100,0:27:26.96,practice and you know he seems to be

0:27:24.980,0:27:29.48,very invested in his own certainty about

0:27:26.960,0:27:30.95,things more than I am but some other

0:27:29.480,0:27:33.59,people will send me things Lydia Davis

0:27:30.950,0:27:35.84,sends me things and Danny how wants Noel

0:27:33.590,0:27:38.00,sends me things and how did you kind of

0:27:35.840,0:27:44.57,develop your revision process and from

0:27:38.000,0:27:46.79,the beginning I guess um well I guess

0:27:44.570,0:27:48.92,you know I was just always looking for

0:27:46.790,0:27:50.93,the best word for instance and it didn't

0:27:48.920,0:27:52.91,always come to me right away but also I

0:27:50.930,0:27:53.96,won't get I don't just get parts of

0:27:52.910,0:27:57.38,things and I know that they're not

0:27:53.960,0:27:59.81,finished you know and then I just try to

0:27:57.380,0:28:02.54,see what what can connect you know I'll

0:27:59.810,0:28:05.42,you know go one way one direction and

0:28:02.540,0:28:07.33,try to connect you know B to a and then

0:28:05.420,0:28:10.21,B doesn't quite connect to eggs

0:28:07.330,0:28:14.37,I'll go on to C&C that connects to a No

0:28:10.210,0:28:16.89,and has that been pretty constant yeah

0:28:14.379,0:28:18.90,have there been any big changes in the

0:28:16.899,0:28:20.98,way you've approached the kind of

0:28:18.909,0:28:25.38,pushing the poem to its finished state

0:28:20.980,0:28:28.17,throughout the time well I bet there

0:28:25.389,0:28:30.70,have but you know I'm as much of a

0:28:28.179,0:28:36.27,stranger to my 24-year old syllabus you

0:28:30.700,0:28:38.71,are almost with the internet and with

0:28:36.279,0:28:40.62,sort of email becoming more you it's

0:28:38.710,0:28:42.48,having more ease it more easily

0:28:40.629,0:28:45.27,available correspondence you did start

0:28:42.489,0:28:46.80,to speed up and the work and do you

0:28:45.279,0:28:48.22,think that's the only reason or do you

0:28:46.809,0:28:50.61,think it's also have something to do

0:28:48.220,0:28:53.52,with with maybe moving on to more of a

0:28:50.619,0:28:54.99,national scene it could be that it could

0:28:53.529,0:28:59.20,be knowing that I have a support of

0:28:54.999,0:29:00.66,publisher it could be just practice you

0:28:59.200,0:29:02.83,know just said I have a better idea of

0:29:00.669,0:29:04.98,what works now yeah yeah what works for

0:29:02.830,0:29:04.98,me

0:29:05.100,0:29:09.87,and I know you don't I think in one of

0:29:08.619,0:29:11.35,your other interviews you said how you

0:29:09.879,0:29:13.53,don't really have like kind of any

0:29:11.350,0:29:16.60,intentions in revising your work but are

0:29:13.539,0:29:17.83,they or are there like primary things

0:29:16.600,0:29:19.65,for different pieces that you're given

0:29:17.830,0:29:21.03,by like are some driven more by sound so

0:29:19.659,0:29:22.77,I'm driven more by meaning some program

0:29:21.039,0:29:25.29,or by connecting the parts of the whole

0:29:22.779,0:29:27.42,or disc we're all arts to the whole all

0:29:25.299,0:29:30.24,of those things equally you know I mean

0:29:27.429,0:29:32.79,I am very interested in sound and sounds

0:29:30.249,0:29:35.55,certain sounds can really bother me or

0:29:32.799,0:29:39.36,you know or I can get stuck on one II to

0:29:35.559,0:29:42.42,have a certain sound so yeah I'm you

0:29:39.369,0:29:45.39,know I insert I mean meaning it's

0:29:42.429,0:29:48.51,important to me to yes and I mean with

0:29:45.399,0:29:50.35,in terms of connecting parts because you

0:29:48.519,0:29:56.00,know as you know if you've looked at my

0:29:50.350,0:29:58.14,work it's often in sections yeah and so

0:29:56.009,0:30:00.60,the sections might be written on

0:29:58.149,0:30:02.20,different days off and are you know so

0:30:00.609,0:30:05.88,and they often come from different

0:30:02.200,0:30:10.11,sources or different inspirations and

0:30:05.889,0:30:11.66,and so then you know the the question is

0:30:10.119,0:30:14.27,how how they Lea

0:30:11.660,0:30:18.05,and you kind of at least if you're me I

0:30:14.270,0:30:21.23,shouldn't say you but I I want there to

0:30:18.050,0:30:23.71,be some kind of possible perceptible

0:30:21.230,0:30:25.64,connection but I also want it to be

0:30:23.710,0:30:27.14,surprising I wanted to kind of go

0:30:25.640,0:30:31.12,somewhere that you didn't expect it to

0:30:27.140,0:30:32.96,go or that I didn't expect it to go so

0:30:31.120,0:30:35.24,sometimes the first thing I come up with

0:30:32.960,0:30:37.19,too obvious and sometimes when I come up

0:30:35.240,0:30:40.40,with is too random and you know it's

0:30:37.190,0:30:43.28,like mm-hmm like Goldilocks and the

0:30:40.400,0:30:45.71,three bears as that sort of looking for

0:30:43.280,0:30:47.51,that surprising Turner or idea I've been

0:30:45.710,0:30:48.74,a constant throughout I mean has that

0:30:47.510,0:30:50.96,been something that's been driving you

0:30:48.740,0:30:53.00,since you started writing I probably

0:30:50.960,0:30:56.09,become more conscious of it but I think

0:30:53.000,0:30:58.46,so yeah and how do so could you talk a

0:30:56.090,0:30:59.99,little about how I mean as you say a lot

0:30:58.460,0:31:01.94,of your poems are in sections and how

0:30:59.990,0:31:03.92,those sections kind of come to be a

0:31:01.940,0:31:05.87,whole like I mean there'll be several

0:31:03.920,0:31:07.37,different days and then in between those

0:31:05.870,0:31:10.34,different sections become different

0:31:07.370,0:31:13.16,poems ah sometimes that happens yeah

0:31:10.340,0:31:15.47,yeah I mean mm-hmm is it just a do you

0:31:13.160,0:31:17.96,just start to see connection I mean I

0:31:15.470,0:31:20.32,guess connect that's sort of good yeah

0:31:17.960,0:31:22.79,and sometimes I have an idea what I want

0:31:20.320,0:31:24.26,vaguely but I don't but I don't know

0:31:22.790,0:31:26.75,exactly where I'm gonna get it or what

0:31:24.260,0:31:29.99,the specifics are but I sometimes I have

0:31:26.750,0:31:32.39,it I just got feeling about the

0:31:29.990,0:31:33.68,direction that I want to go and other

0:31:32.390,0:31:36.08,times I don't and I just have to be

0:31:33.680,0:31:37.85,surprised and just know that I want

0:31:36.080,0:31:42.71,something I should keep my eyes open for

0:31:37.850,0:31:44.33,it and do you I guess is it the I mean

0:31:42.710,0:31:45.86,there's a certain point where you say

0:31:44.330,0:31:47.03,within the within the emails you get

0:31:45.860,0:31:49.40,some sort of affirmation but then

0:31:47.030,0:31:50.93,personally do you when do you do you

0:31:49.400,0:31:52.28,feel like a sense of like oh that's

0:31:50.930,0:31:56.87,surprising I mean is there like a like

0:31:52.280,0:31:58.31,an aha moment I mean yeah sure um yeah

0:31:56.870,0:32:02.57,you have to please yourself first

0:31:58.310,0:32:05.50,um you know and I think one reason that

0:32:02.570,0:32:08.69,I tend to send the poems out is that

0:32:05.500,0:32:10.58,I'll be decided I tend to I mean I will

0:32:08.690,0:32:14.03,be dissatisfied and pool with things

0:32:10.580,0:32:16.10,forever unless somebody goes hey that's

0:32:14.030,0:32:17.66,good you know I I mean I'll go maybe

0:32:16.100,0:32:19.52,it's not good maybe I should do

0:32:17.660,0:32:21.17,something else so you know I think

0:32:19.520,0:32:23.15,that's why I need I need somebody to

0:32:21.170,0:32:23.92,give me a kind of end point let me say

0:32:23.150,0:32:28.54,you

0:32:23.929,0:32:30.59,cut it out I mean sometimes I know but

0:32:28.549,0:32:34.03,sometimes I can be insecure and just

0:32:30.590,0:32:37.19,fiddle right and then I guess is there

0:32:34.039,0:32:38.87,is there any way do you once the poem

0:32:37.190,0:32:40.82,kind of reaches like the deep minder

0:32:38.870,0:32:42.38,stage is there any time that you start

0:32:40.820,0:32:44.21,to see the way those are working and go

0:32:42.380,0:32:45.67,back and revise there or once it's there

0:32:44.210,0:32:48.11,it's usually kind of off-limits

0:32:45.679,0:32:51.32,well I went to it was off-limits but it

0:32:48.110,0:32:53.63,I don't usually revise then but I have I

0:32:51.320,0:32:55.19,mean it has happened that um I've

0:32:53.630,0:32:57.83,suddenly seen how something could be

0:32:55.190,0:32:59.63,better and you know I've gone away from

0:32:57.830,0:33:02.36,and gone back to it and went oh that

0:32:59.630,0:33:07.19,could be better but I would say that you

0:33:02.360,0:33:08.84,know maybe one time in 20 oh yeah and

0:33:07.190,0:33:14.09,then when did you start using the CC

0:33:08.840,0:33:16.28,spiders a long time ago um maybe 202,
0:33:14.090,0:33:18.40,years ago they used to be easy to find

0:33:16.280,0:33:20.29,but now like I said they're antique oh

0:33:18.409,0:33:21.50,it's cool yeah and before when you were

0:33:20.299,0:33:24.71,first putting your first collection

0:33:21.500,0:33:26.92,together how did that work I might have

0:33:24.710,0:33:28.82,had one even though I'm mantra because

0:33:26.929,0:33:30.32,everyone used to this is what used to

0:33:28.820,0:33:32.33,happen people everyone used to bring

0:33:30.320,0:33:34.22,these to a reading and just read from

0:33:32.330,0:33:35.48,them uh-huh I don't even do that anymore

0:33:34.220,0:33:37.61,because they're too heavy to carry I

0:33:35.480,0:33:44.75,just print them out but um that's what

0:33:37.610,0:33:46.37,people used to do so everyone had one is

0:33:44.750,0:33:48.08,there any other role that other people

0:33:46.370,0:33:49.37,play in the process of your revisions

0:33:48.080,0:33:51.71,are there any other people that are

0:33:49.370,0:33:56.17,important to those kind of finding the

0:33:51.710,0:33:59.15,finished pieces well I think not really

0:33:56.179,0:34:01.54,except sometimes my editor gives me a

0:33:59.150,0:34:04.66,little bit of guidance not about

0:34:01.549,0:34:07.01,individual poems but about the order of

0:34:04.669,0:34:08.41,poems within the manuscript I usually

0:34:07.010,0:34:10.12,think I know but sometimes she has a

0:34:08.419,0:34:14.92,different idea that she runs by me and

0:34:10.129,0:34:16.85,we considered that and then sort of

0:34:14.929,0:34:19.19,moving on to the sort of organizational

0:34:16.850,0:34:21.23,what I call a relational archival and

0:34:19.190,0:34:23.35,we've kind of covered some of this but I

0:34:21.230,0:34:24.95,mean when you were first so in the in

0:34:23.359,0:34:27.10,the early days before the computers when

0:34:24.950,0:34:29.24,you kind of hit that what we would say a

0:34:27.109,0:34:31.85,final piece is you send it out would you

0:34:29.240,0:34:33.66,also like keep a printed page oh sure

0:34:31.850,0:34:36.25,okay and that would be in the in that

0:34:33.669,0:34:40.17,how would you communicate with your

0:34:36.250,0:34:42.78,publisher with those um but why suppose

0:34:40.179,0:34:44.71,we had to communicate by by snail mail

0:34:42.789,0:34:45.70,how else was there right and so you

0:34:44.710,0:34:47.64,would you would have you would collect

0:34:45.700,0:34:50.13,those all and would you make a copy of

0:34:47.649,0:34:52.48,it before you send it off I mean oh yeah

0:34:50.139,0:34:54.97,yeah I probably rocks it I mean there

0:34:52.480,0:34:59.14,were zero ox machines yeah

0:34:54.970,0:35:01.00,and then I guess in the once things were

0:34:59.140,0:35:03.27,published and things did you start to

0:35:01.000,0:35:05.01,kind of keep an archive an archive of

0:35:03.279,0:35:06.60,your own work at that point I mean did

0:35:05.019,0:35:08.65,you have like boxes with your book with

0:35:06.609,0:35:10.42,your papers in it even at the beginning

0:35:08.650,0:35:12.81,or did that kind of start to come more

0:35:10.420,0:35:14.61,gradually a back came more gradually I

0:35:12.819,0:35:16.45,mean I wish that I had kept my letters

0:35:14.619,0:35:18.88,right from the beginning because I had a

0:35:16.450,0:35:21.03,letter from George often and I had a

0:35:18.880,0:35:25.93,letter from Robert Creeley it really

0:35:21.039,0:35:27.03,took me a while to realize that this was

0:35:25.930,0:35:30.13,all gonna be worth anything

0:35:27.039,0:35:32.28,I didn't it it took seeing some of my

0:35:30.130,0:35:34.53,friend the way some of my friends took

0:35:32.289,0:35:37.66,it seriously like Lynn had Union and

0:35:34.539,0:35:41.81,organized things and treated it as if

0:35:37.660,0:35:44.55,you know you it was all worthwhile yeah

0:35:41.819,0:35:46.66,but I you know I didn't come from an

0:35:44.559,0:35:49.59,intellectual family were background and

0:35:46.660,0:35:51.30,and so you know it wasn't natural to

0:35:49.599,0:35:58.66,really for me we're gonna have to learn

0:35:51.309,0:36:01.77,it I guess I guess I'm interested in

0:35:58.660,0:36:03.49,that and like how did how the lessons

0:36:01.779,0:36:05.23,were just from watching them do that or

0:36:03.490,0:36:07.35,were they from the conversations I mean

0:36:05.230,0:36:09.36,did you just sort of notice that Linda

0:36:07.359,0:36:11.89,Jenni and sort of had a had the kept

0:36:09.369,0:36:14.17,things better or I mean well I think at

0:36:11.890,0:36:15.84,some point she sold her papers anyway Oh

0:36:14.170,0:36:20.01,people sold their papers and been

0:36:15.849,0:36:23.71,getting money and and also I would

0:36:20.019,0:36:25.86,notice that she wrote letters as if as

0:36:23.710,0:36:27.16,if she was writing for an archive I mean

0:36:25.869,0:36:29.07,she would kind of give you the backstory

0:36:27.160,0:36:30.57,that you already knew and I'm going oh

0:36:29.079,0:36:42.84,wait who's she talking to

0:36:30.579,0:36:45.00,the archive and so I guess I still don't

0:36:42.849,0:36:46.59,do that but I think I didn't email is

0:36:45.009,0:36:48.84,ended pretty much ended that form

0:36:46.599,0:36:50.07,people now people just shoot off emails

0:36:48.849,0:36:50.71,and so I don't know what's happening to

0:36:50.079,0:36:52.83,archives

0:36:50.710,0:36:54.67,ya know right I mean is there any way

0:36:52.839,0:36:57.13,that you try to save your emails are

0:36:54.670,0:36:59.20,there anything I have saved emails and

0:36:57.130,0:37:04.86,even printed them out and given them to

0:36:59.200,0:37:06.88,libraries um but I just I think Ron

0:37:04.869,0:37:08.49,hates everything so everything I said to

0:37:06.880,0:37:11.17,him gets saved that's how I look at it

0:37:08.499,0:37:12.99,please excuse my archivist I mean I only

0:37:11.170,0:37:16.05,you know there's only so much space in

0:37:12.999,0:37:17.41,my house and I know you can save things

0:37:16.059,0:37:20.01,on your hard drive and give your hard

0:37:17.410,0:37:22.74,drive to a library but God knows what's

0:37:20.019,0:37:24.09,on my hard drive so so far I just I mean

0:37:22.749,0:37:25.66,what I do know is if there's anything

0:37:24.099,0:37:27.30,that seems especially interesting or

0:37:25.660,0:37:29.95,valuable I'll print it out and keep it

0:37:27.309,0:37:31.72,okay and they do you like when you first

0:37:29.950,0:37:33.06,started writing the e-mails back and

0:37:31.720,0:37:35.52,forth and kind of a general

0:37:33.069,0:37:37.29,correspondence what was a sort of tenor

0:37:35.529,0:37:39.19,of those what did it still feel more

0:37:37.299,0:37:42.57,like a letter I mean you know I'm

0:37:39.190,0:37:46.59,gradual change yeah I mean sure letters

0:37:42.579,0:37:48.51,were letters and uh and I should go look

0:37:46.599,0:37:51.27,up my old letters I could I could go to

0:37:48.519,0:37:53.22,an archive even look at them um yeah I

0:37:51.279,0:37:56.55,think you would you would talk about

0:37:53.229,0:37:58.32,various things how you how your life was

0:37:56.559,0:38:01.47,going and then you would say and by the

0:37:58.329,0:38:02.92,way I wrote this you include it but you

0:38:01.479,0:38:06.16,would be catching up sure

0:38:02.920,0:38:08.76,no we catch up all the time you know are

0:38:06.160,0:38:11.31,you on any social media thing do you do

0:38:08.769,0:38:14.73,Facebook and I'm also on Twitter but I

0:38:11.319,0:38:17.22,don't tweet much whatever is a few

0:38:14.739,0:38:18.96,things yeah but I I'm sure I'm on

0:38:17.229,0:38:22.59,Facebook I mean that's how I get some of

0:38:18.969,0:38:24.96,my news yeah yeah do you remember when

0:38:22.599,0:38:28.77,you liked your first email or any of

0:38:24.969,0:38:31.35,that sort of thing I don't remember I

0:38:28.779,0:38:34.63,don't earn for my first you know I

0:38:31.359,0:38:38.49,remember that Ron said I hadn't ramped

0:38:34.630,0:38:40.42,up quickly that was flattering so I

0:38:38.499,0:38:42.67,remember it did you where you first

0:38:40.420,0:38:45.24,given an email because of your work

0:38:42.670,0:38:50.61,because of UCSD was that your first no

0:38:45.249,0:38:52.63,um no I got it on my own and and when my

0:38:50.619,0:38:54.81,son was still living here and he helped

0:38:52.630,0:38:57.94,me set everything up I mean you know he

0:38:54.819,0:38:59.89,was probably 14 or something so that's

0:38:57.940,0:39:01.93,why I have a really stupid

0:38:59.890,0:39:04.69,I mean my university address I guess you

0:39:01.930,0:39:05.85,wrote me at my university - sir oh yes I

0:39:04.690,0:39:07.66,think both you gave me the other one

0:39:05.859,0:39:10.53,because which is really stupid cuz it's

0:39:07.660,0:39:13.02,RA ei one hundred nine hundred I

0:39:10.539,0:39:14.58,shouldn't say that anything my son said

0:39:13.029,0:39:16.21,was stupid but he was only about forty

0:39:14.589,0:39:18.22,minute I guess you thought that was I

0:39:16.210,0:39:21.13,feel like I have I'm James Bond or

0:39:18.220,0:39:30.16,something what would that email address

0:39:21.130,0:39:32.47,but whatever so I mean it seems to me

0:39:30.160,0:39:35.65,like instead of talking about the the

0:39:32.470,0:39:36.94,progression that the main difference the

0:39:35.650,0:39:38.68,main change has really just been the

0:39:36.940,0:39:40.75,kind of speed with which email allows

0:39:38.680,0:39:42.70,you to kind of get to a point where you

0:39:40.750,0:39:44.82,think things are solid enough for a

0:39:42.700,0:39:46.24,collection yeah are there anything is

0:39:44.829,0:39:49.24,there anything else you can think of

0:39:46.240,0:39:51.49,that really changed as technology

0:39:49.240,0:39:55.21,changed or do you feel like for the most

0:39:51.490,0:39:56.55,part not that the typewriter in the

0:39:55.210,0:39:58.11,computer are the same but that you were

0:39:56.559,0:40:00.46,you know the relationship between the

0:39:58.119,0:40:03.70,notebook and those sort of typing

0:40:00.460,0:40:05.74,procedures were similar well I was never

0:40:03.700,0:40:07.72,a great typist so I was always making

0:40:05.740,0:40:09.64,mistakes so it was always frustrating of

0:40:07.720,0:40:12.13,course sometimes I hate my computer - I

0:40:09.640,0:40:15.00,mean you know it's it's not a question

0:40:12.130,0:40:15.97,of the typing issue but just you know we

0:40:15.009,0:40:19.39,all hate our computers

0:40:15.970,0:40:21.51,yes slow they yeah whatever so sometimes

0:40:19.390,0:40:22.48,I'm yelling at my computer what did you

0:40:21.519,0:40:25.00,just do

0:40:22.480,0:40:27.03,Chuck you know you know you don't lose a

0:40:25.000,0:40:30.43,document you're right I'll go what I did

0:40:27.039,0:40:32.76,what it's gone you know yeah so I have a

0:40:30.430,0:40:33.73,kind of adversarial relationship with it

0:40:32.769,0:40:36.03,but I use it all the time

0:40:33.730,0:40:37.48,and if you lost something then you would

0:40:36.039,0:40:40.50,go back which one would be your first

0:40:37.480,0:40:42.64,move well supposedly you can hit I think

0:40:40.509,0:40:44.92,it's control X and get it back but that

0:40:42.640,0:40:46.93,doesn't work very well for me

0:40:44.920,0:40:48.36,would you go back to an email I mean

0:40:46.930,0:40:50.41,like with you well if I'd send an email

0:40:48.369,0:40:52.39,sure yeah

0:40:50.410,0:40:54.43,what's what's what does like the

0:40:52.390,0:40:55.96,revision like if it's just you on it on

0:40:54.430,0:40:57.51,the era you're upstairs computer what

0:40:55.960,0:40:59.65,does that revision look like I mean are

0:40:57.519,0:41:01.53,you moving things around a lot or are

0:40:59.650,0:41:04.99,you is it more just sort of reading and

0:41:01.539,0:41:06.25,then deleting and inserting new words

0:41:04.990,0:41:08.08,yeah that would be

0:41:06.250,0:41:11.02,mostly do you read them out loud to

0:41:08.080,0:41:13.11,yourself yeah is that used when do you

0:41:11.020,0:41:18.97,start doing that in the notebook in the

0:41:13.119,0:41:20.80,notebook and so can you talk a little

0:41:18.970,0:41:22.24,bit more about how that works I mean is

0:41:20.800,0:41:23.77,it something that you're like as you're

0:41:22.240,0:41:25.69,writing the first line you're reading

0:41:23.770,0:41:27.97,out loud or is it like you finished - I

0:41:25.690,0:41:29.65,probably well in between not the first

0:41:27.970,0:41:31.39,line but I probably have to have a few

0:41:29.650,0:41:36.22,lines but before I thought it was worth

0:41:31.390,0:41:39.73,reading them out loud see I should get

0:41:36.220,0:41:48.09,to something bad that changed a lot but

0:41:39.730,0:41:48.09,then that would be embarrassing right

0:41:52.440,0:42:01.35,yeah I mean I don't know the things that

0:41:57.820,0:42:05.61,I start out writing change so much let's

0:42:01.359,0:42:07.54,see um okay I can get to a poem that's

0:42:05.619,0:42:11.08,finished and I can read a little bit

0:42:07.540,0:42:13.06,from my journal that were the beginning

0:42:11.080,0:42:15.52,of it I guess

0:42:13.060,0:42:21.48,okay although it's the beginning is

0:42:15.520,0:42:26.34,going to be very bad you can stand back

0:42:21.480,0:42:33.25,okay so this is in two parts and I think

0:42:26.349,0:42:34.72,this part is working on first of all

0:42:33.250,0:42:36.64,it's very hard to read my handwriting

0:42:34.720,0:42:38.23,even for me to read it when I'm looking

0:42:36.640,0:42:40.50,back at something I wrote a while ago

0:42:38.230,0:42:40.50,now

0:42:45.440,0:42:48.63,[Applause]

0:42:55.610,0:43:01.65,okay so there's all right is it okay for

0:43:00.030,0:43:04.80,you to read the poem there was that

0:43:01.650,0:43:08.40,always a time no absolutely okay so this

0:43:04.800,0:43:12.24,is called particular Roth squat bent

0:43:08.400,0:43:15.15,crabbed cranky a crank is a person who

0:43:12.240,0:43:19.04,is over enthusiastic about a particular

0:43:15.150,0:43:22.29,topic to be particular is to be choosy a

0:43:19.040,0:43:25.94,particle is a body whose extent and

0:43:22.290,0:43:29.28,internal structure if any are irrelevant

0:43:25.940,0:43:32.13,you there let's dispense with these

0:43:29.280,0:43:35.13,properties of matter such an Akron

0:43:32.130,0:43:39.35,estate clothes as ghosts where let's be

0:43:35.130,0:43:42.06,mirrors facing mirrors fall in love

0:43:39.350,0:43:48.69,okay so here's some some build-up to

0:43:42.060,0:43:51.72,that which is really doesn't sound like

0:43:48.690,0:43:54.39,a poem at all um okay this is

0:43:51.720,0:43:56.73,embarrassing but okay to load you show

0:43:54.390,0:43:58.68,yourself willing to erase yourself make

0:43:56.730,0:44:01.05,yourself blank together for a few

0:43:58.680,0:44:03.93,moments see this is just prose in order

0:44:01.050,0:44:06.57,to reflect the other that ended up being

0:44:03.930,0:44:10.20,you know let's be mirrors facing mirrors

0:44:06.570,0:44:13.50,fall in love right to to cloudless skies

0:44:10.200,0:44:16.91,no earth between the young do it best

0:44:13.500,0:44:19.56,now everyone has lost the trick of it

0:44:16.910,0:44:21.45,for love they empty themselves and I

0:44:19.560,0:44:24.27,guess I'm rewriting for love they empty

0:44:21.450,0:44:26.37,themselves mirrors reflecting mirrors so

0:44:24.270,0:44:30.06,that gets a bit of that the young to

0:44:26.370,0:44:32.90,cloudless skies nothing between not like

0:44:30.060,0:44:35.46,us condensed into these peculiar shapes

0:44:32.900,0:44:36.99,for love they empty themselves and this

0:44:35.460,0:44:39.06,is starting over again until their

0:44:36.990,0:44:42.18,mirrors reflecting mirrors the young

0:44:39.060,0:44:45.60,unlike us who have assumed these

0:44:42.180,0:44:47.40,peculiar shapes they forget everything

0:44:45.600,0:44:49.92,until their mirrors reflecting mirrors

0:44:47.400,0:44:51.24,the young open channels and I took that

0:44:49.920,0:44:54.39,out eventually though through which

0:44:51.240,0:44:55.80,charges flow not us they forget

0:44:54.390,0:44:58.74,everything until their mirrors

0:44:55.800,0:45:00.26,reflecting mirrors they fall in love the

0:44:58.740,0:45:02.60,trick the young can do

0:45:00.260,0:45:05.86,unlike us with our definite opinions and

0:45:02.600,0:45:10.60,habits these properties and mass change

0:45:05.869,0:45:12.92,spin so that gets to where I was talking

0:45:10.609,0:45:14.78,about a particle is a body whose ik so

0:45:12.920,0:45:16.55,that's like subatomic right whose extent

0:45:14.780,0:45:18.08,an internal structure if any are

0:45:16.550,0:45:20.15,irrelevant let's dispense with these

0:45:18.080,0:45:21.38,properties of matter so anyway here I've

0:45:20.150,0:45:24.32,started to get into that these

0:45:21.380,0:45:26.96,properties on mass charge spin are like

0:45:24.320,0:45:28.70,the clothes that go swear well that gets

0:45:26.960,0:45:30.80,into here except there's I there's no

0:45:28.700,0:45:32.51,similar just goes let's dispense with

0:45:30.800,0:45:34.67,these properties of matter such

0:45:32.510,0:45:37.58,anachronistic clothes as ghost wear

0:45:34.670,0:45:38.66,let's be mirrors facing mirrors but do

0:45:37.580,0:45:43.31,you you could see how some of that

0:45:38.660,0:45:45.19,worked into that so I kind of moves I

0:45:43.310,0:45:47.24,mean not quite chronologically but

0:45:45.190,0:45:49.19,sequentially and you know sort of it's

0:45:47.240,0:45:52.10,not and it's not even a winnowing it's

0:45:49.190,0:45:53.78,sort of an addition and subtraction and

0:45:52.100,0:45:55.19,this is stuff that run not even run

0:45:53.780,0:45:57.56,silliman sees because I wouldn't send

0:45:55.190,0:45:59.51,anything that inchoate to anyone okay

0:45:57.560,0:46:01.19,so now you're seeing something you're

0:45:59.510,0:46:02.48,hearing something that nobody has heard

0:46:01.190,0:46:05.18,yeah

0:46:02.480,0:46:07.34,no it's fascinating and then so at a

0:46:05.180,0:46:09.20,certain point when you move to that does

0:46:07.340,0:46:11.96,that sort of stop in the journal in the

0:46:09.200,0:46:16.94,notebook I mean the next poem I mean one

0:46:11.960,0:46:18.61,once I move to this then I'm I seldom go

0:46:16.940,0:46:20.72,back to the notebook okay ever then like

0:46:18.619,0:46:23.86,the next page then would be the next

0:46:20.720,0:46:27.61,poem that you work on yeah unless yeah

0:46:23.869,0:46:29.42,and unless I decide that say the last

0:46:27.619,0:46:32.24,part of this is bad I didn't start off

0:46:29.420,0:46:34.55,then I might start over in the book and

0:46:32.240,0:46:37.01,so the type of revision then that

0:46:34.550,0:46:38.45,happens on the on the iPad I mean it's

0:46:37.010,0:46:40.36,not as easy to kind of move things

0:46:38.450,0:46:45.08,around there I mean what what usually

0:46:40.369,0:46:46.97,occurs well fortunately for me my poems

0:46:45.080,0:46:49.07,don't have a lot of words and you have a

0:46:46.970,0:46:51.05,short line so I just dragged back things

0:46:49.070,0:46:52.70,out and start over I just do that okay

0:46:51.050,0:46:55.28,okay

0:46:52.700,0:46:58.70,is there any sort of formatting that you

0:46:55.280,0:47:00.50,use in I mean either here or on your PC

0:46:58.700,0:47:01.82,that you like you've kind of developed

0:47:00.500,0:47:03.23,like do you have like a certain font

0:47:01.820,0:47:04.52,that you use or anything like that or is

0:47:03.230,0:47:06.08,that not really a concern of yours

0:47:04.520,0:47:08.54,it's not really a concern I mean I

0:47:06.080,0:47:12.43,wouldn't want to hate hate of font but

0:47:08.540,0:47:12.43,I'm okay with the standard font yeah

0:47:13.340,0:47:19.58,and then I guess I'm wondering then

0:47:16.010,0:47:22.37,before there were before you had the

0:47:19.580,0:47:24.02,iPad you would just take the notebook up

0:47:22.370,0:47:26.15,to your computer and write it down there

0:47:24.020,0:47:29.72,yeah it would be the Train of course so

0:47:26.150,0:47:32.03,it's almost like an ease of please yeah

0:47:29.720,0:47:34.01,absolutely because I'm comfortable in

0:47:32.030,0:47:36.47,this room and I I will just stay there

0:47:34.010,0:47:38.99,with my coffee playing around here for

0:47:36.470,0:47:44.21,quite a while so I think that's just you

0:47:38.990,0:47:46.01,know have it yeah yeah do you use the

0:47:44.210,0:47:47.78,like so when you're connected up there

0:47:46.010,0:47:50.03,is the internet always connected as well

0:47:47.780,0:47:51.11,are you a minute are you doing any sort

0:47:50.030,0:47:53.90,of are you using it for research

0:47:51.110,0:47:55.81,purposes or reference purposes yeah I

0:47:53.900,0:47:58.28,mean not for in terms of my teaching

0:47:55.810,0:48:00.62,okay because I'm preparing to teach this

0:47:58.280,0:48:02.36,class I've never taught before and I'm

0:48:00.620,0:48:04.10,gonna be teaching it with a guy with a

0:48:02.360,0:48:06.41,physicist where it's called poetry for

0:48:04.100,0:48:07.88,physicists and and he's been getting a

0:48:06.410,0:48:09.35,lot of press lately I don't know if

0:48:07.880,0:48:11.24,you've seen it Bryan Keating he was

0:48:09.350,0:48:14.21,involved with the discovery at the South

0:48:11.240,0:48:16.91,Pole yeah yeah yeah yeah Wow

0:48:14.210,0:48:18.89,so um and he's interested in poetry so

0:48:16.910,0:48:23.84,anyway I'm doing research for that and I

0:48:18.890,0:48:26.12,was just you know I'm using some ancient

0:48:23.840,0:48:28.79,poets like Lucretia's who wrote about

0:48:26.120,0:48:31.28,science you know I mean he wrote the

0:48:28.790,0:48:34.00,ancient Greeks like Lucretia's but you

0:48:31.280,0:48:36.62,know knew about or or not new but

0:48:34.000,0:48:38.72,hypothesized the existence of atoms and

0:48:36.620,0:48:40.52,the void and you know so I'm I'm was

0:48:38.720,0:48:42.83,just doing some research about him and

0:48:40.520,0:48:47.84,and on the computer and then printing it

0:48:42.830,0:48:49.22,out and yeah yeah i know i when i read

0:48:47.840,0:48:52.91,about the when i was reading your

0:48:49.220,0:48:56.78,working discovery or confirmation of the

0:48:52.910,0:48:59.09,inflation theory try to cut this well I

0:48:56.780,0:49:02.93,started out he's my bud oh yeah that's

0:48:59.090,0:49:04.58,awesome yeah good and how long have you

0:49:02.930,0:49:08.44,been in conversation with him I

0:49:04.580,0:49:11.63,dedicated a poem to him in this book um

0:49:08.440,0:49:15.38,so I've been in conversation with him

0:49:11.630,0:49:19.70,for I don't know maybe three years so

0:49:15.380,0:49:24.01,the poem called account is based on a

0:49:19.700,0:49:24.01,conversation that we had there is

0:49:24.359,0:49:30.18,what are you curious II brought for

0:49:27.089,0:49:31.82,Bryan Keating oh I don't think so I mean

0:49:30.180,0:49:33.48,he's an astrophysicist they don't write

0:49:31.829,0:49:35.70,both you mentioned somebody that like

0:49:33.480,0:49:38.00,there was a some looks more popular

0:49:35.700,0:49:40.07,science writer that you were reading oh

0:49:38.009,0:49:42.66,I read you know I mean Brian Greene

0:49:40.079,0:49:45.08,different yeah different Brian opinions

0:49:42.660,0:49:47.03,because of the brown and how long has

0:49:45.089,0:49:50.70,that been a sort of subjective

0:49:47.039,0:49:53.69,fascination for you I think I I start

0:49:50.700,0:49:56.75,the first time I did anything with

0:49:53.690,0:49:58.79,particle physics was really when it

0:49:56.759,0:50:00.56,first became popularized like when the

0:49:58.799,0:50:02.33,dala physics came out in the eighties

0:50:00.569,0:50:05.19,and at first I thought it was just kind

0:50:02.339,0:50:06.45,of absurd all of the particles ooh and I

0:50:05.190,0:50:09.11,thought it was just like how many angels

0:50:06.450,0:50:10.61,can stand on the head of a pin or

0:50:09.119,0:50:12.59,whatever you know but I was still

0:50:10.619,0:50:14.21,reading it didn't sort of interested in

0:50:12.599,0:50:16.52,it and then um

0:50:14.210,0:50:21.15,starting with my book up to speed in

0:50:16.529,0:50:23.70,2004 I've you know taking a more just

0:50:21.150,0:50:25.47,and interesting mm-hmm and so what

0:50:23.700,0:50:27.15,what's this class going to look like

0:50:25.470,0:50:30.39,overall do you have like that

0:50:27.150,0:50:32.48,a shape to it or yeah yeah I mean I'm

0:50:30.390,0:50:34.92,never team taught before but you know

0:50:32.489,0:50:37.85,some days I'll be talking I've chosen

0:50:34.920,0:50:45.35,poems that either have something to do

0:50:37.859,0:50:48.29,with cosmology or physics in some way or

0:50:45.359,0:50:51.42,that have to do with objectivity and

0:50:48.299,0:50:55.73,subjectivity and theories of mind or

0:50:51.420,0:51:00.32,then in a different way going off of

0:50:55.739,0:51:03.35,kind of chaos theory where complexity

0:51:00.329,0:51:06.59,can be developed can grow from from the

0:51:03.359,0:51:08.70,iteration of simple rules I'm using some

0:51:06.599,0:51:10.52,poets like what like Franz silliman and

0:51:08.700,0:51:16.17,like Jackson applo and like Christian

0:51:10.529,0:51:18.15,book the pole poet who used constraints

0:51:16.170,0:51:20.09,or rules to generate poems you know and

0:51:18.150,0:51:22.51,have math and their poems in you know

0:51:20.099,0:51:24.72,not as a subject but as a generative

0:51:22.519,0:51:28.38,principle right so I'm doing some of

0:51:24.720,0:51:32.19,that and then Brian is you know he he

0:51:28.380,0:51:35.03,likes poetry but he's you know he's he's

0:51:32.190,0:51:37.34,not exactly up to the avant-garde shall

0:51:35.039,0:51:39.69,we say he likes sonnets and

0:51:37.349,0:51:42.26,and such so we have a bit of that okay

0:51:39.690,0:51:43.76,and will it will it be a class in which

0:51:42.269,0:51:45.32,you ask the students to write or a

0:51:43.769,0:51:47.00,little more it's not really a writing

0:51:45.329,0:51:48.23,class here I mean they're gonna write

0:51:47.009,0:51:49.97,one poem and they're gonna write a

0:51:48.239,0:51:51.45,couple of essays and there's you're

0:51:49.979,0:51:52.95,gonna be a couple of tasks and it's

0:51:51.450,0:51:57.59,supposed to be reading and discussion

0:51:52.950,0:52:14.06,course notes in this great start to

0:51:57.599,0:52:16.22,raises it starts next Tuesday so are

0:52:14.069,0:52:17.99,there any other so I mean that you know

0:52:16.229,0:52:19.41,these are kind of I don't know how far

0:52:17.999,0:52:21.96,you want to get into this physics in

0:52:19.410,0:52:23.64,terms of teaching when did when did that

0:52:21.960,0:52:25.76,sort of email and computers start to

0:52:23.640,0:52:32.36,kind of take over that I mean it's sort

0:52:25.769,0:52:34.34,of like 2000 early 2000s um email I

0:52:32.369,0:52:36.98,think that was in the 90s wasn't it yeah

0:52:34.349,0:52:39.96,yeah and has that do you feel like

0:52:36.989,0:52:42.80,that's changed how you approach students

0:52:39.960,0:52:44.78,and how you approach your classes well

0:52:42.809,0:52:49.10,yeah I know your students can always

0:52:44.789,0:52:50.57,find you yeah um it certainly made it

0:52:49.109,0:52:52.61,easier to write a syllabus having a

0:52:50.579,0:52:55.01,computer yeah and you can you know you

0:52:52.619,0:52:56.27,can you constantly email your students

0:52:55.019,0:52:57.39,and remind them what they're supposed to

0:52:56.279,0:52:59.88,be doing

0:52:57.390,0:53:01.22,I think it's meat just made into you

0:52:59.880,0:53:04.24,here for everyone mhm

0:53:01.229,0:53:06.35,is there a way do you see any sort of

0:53:04.249,0:53:07.92,differences in understanding of your

0:53:06.359,0:53:14.40,students now as to your students like

0:53:07.920,0:53:16.07,say fifteen twenty years ago um well I

0:53:14.400,0:53:19.01,think that you know then certainly

0:53:16.079,0:53:24.39,students your students do gradually

0:53:19.019,0:53:29.57,change I think that it's when you teach

0:53:24.390,0:53:31.44,young people you kind of sort of stay in

0:53:29.579,0:53:33.35,that world you hear their expressions

0:53:31.440,0:53:36.26,I'm not saying that I'm a digital need

0:53:33.359,0:53:39.42,to by a long shot but you know you you

0:53:36.269,0:53:41.19,uh sort of here's the way they talk and

0:53:39.420,0:53:44.13,you get a bit of their mind set and you

0:53:41.190,0:53:46.04,you know you know their lingo and in a

0:53:44.130,0:53:47.25,way that um I think when I retire I

0:53:46.049,0:53:51.30,might

0:53:47.250,0:53:52.83,yeah yeah but still if something goes

0:53:51.300,0:53:55.38,wrong with my computer I have to get my

0:53:52.830,0:53:57.39,son to help me so that's actually I've

0:53:55.380,0:53:59.37,found this has been kind of a theme if

0:53:57.390,0:54:00.69,you do have somebody who comes in and

0:53:59.370,0:54:03.09,helps you if you have any compute what

0:54:00.690,0:54:05.40,yeah he lives in Seattle but he's walked

0:54:03.090,0:54:07.95,me through things on the phone okay

0:54:05.400,0:54:09.45,and as he set up did he set up your

0:54:07.950,0:54:10.59,computer when you've got it and stuff

0:54:09.450,0:54:14.67,like that

0:54:10.590,0:54:16.62,my name is 14 he's built a computer even

0:54:14.670,0:54:18.12,though he's he like in is he like

0:54:16.620,0:54:20.28,working in the decency I was he working

0:54:18.120,0:54:21.78,in me no I usually is a scientist but

0:54:20.280,0:54:27.90,it's not in the computer industry to

0:54:21.780,0:54:30.06,biologists so I'm fairly well through

0:54:27.900,0:54:32.22,the covers which would I'd like to cover

0:54:30.060,0:54:34.17,I do have my blunt questions at the end

0:54:32.220,0:54:36.03,so do you I mean are is there any sort

0:54:34.170,0:54:38.31,of overarching thing that you think has

0:54:36.030,0:54:40.20,changed with the advent of computers in

0:54:38.310,0:54:43.32,terms of writing I mean like do you see

0:54:40.200,0:54:46.11,like so like sort of maybe changing tone

0:54:43.320,0:54:50.28,a change in tenor a change in mmm ideas

0:54:46.110,0:54:52.37,well yeah I mean um well the fact that I

0:54:50.280,0:54:57.75,just recently wrote a poem that

0:54:52.370,0:55:00.51,references milady calm right and I could

0:54:57.750,0:55:02.45,if I can I could bring up that section

0:55:00.510,0:55:04.68,of it for you anyway because it's

0:55:02.450,0:55:06.62,certainly something that would not have

0:55:04.680,0:55:09.03,been written had there not been

0:55:06.620,0:55:12.36,computers it goes protect your identity

0:55:09.030,0:55:14.61,says my liege calm three times today is

0:55:12.360,0:55:17.31,if it knew something I may want to fly

0:55:14.610,0:55:20.91,cheap cruise in luxury by a walk-in tub

0:55:17.310,0:55:23.76,and burial insurance how they try to

0:55:20.910,0:55:26.10,sell you things um so yeah I mean I

0:55:23.760,0:55:27.93,think that that gets into the content of

0:55:26.100,0:55:33.03,the work and then there are groups of

0:55:27.930,0:55:35.01,poets who work in that realm kind of

0:55:33.030,0:55:37.32,specifically and almost exclusively like

0:55:35.010,0:55:40.80,the flarf poet for instance just do what

0:55:37.320,0:55:42.72,they call Google my name yeah or and and

0:55:40.800,0:55:46.20,also of course there are digital poets

0:55:42.720,0:55:48.53,there's digital poetry where people are

0:55:46.200,0:55:50.79,write poems especially for the computer

0:55:48.530,0:55:52.32,where the I don't know the words fall

0:55:50.790,0:55:54.78,off the screen at different rates and

0:55:52.320,0:55:56.58,such yeah do you do you do I mean if

0:55:54.780,0:55:57.30,you're going to like be reading poems or

0:55:56.580,0:55:58.56,for

0:55:57.300,0:56:00.54,reason do you find that you're reading

0:55:58.560,0:56:02.34,them a lot more on your screen than you

0:56:00.540,0:56:04.05,used to I mean I don't like to read on

0:56:02.340,0:56:06.42,the screen I mean I do read things on

0:56:04.050,0:56:08.85,the screen but if if I'm judging a

0:56:06.420,0:56:11.19,contest or something which I sometimes -

0:56:08.850,0:56:12.93,I asked for hard copies or if I get them

0:56:11.190,0:56:14.43,on the screen I print them because I

0:56:12.930,0:56:17.52,just don't like to read on the screen I

0:56:14.430,0:56:19.47,mean I feel I don't want to sit up there

0:56:17.520,0:56:28.40,at a hard chair I don't want to look at

0:56:19.470,0:56:32.87,that light you know thank you very much

0:56:28.400,0:56:32.87,all right this was painless yeah
