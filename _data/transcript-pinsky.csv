0:01:59.189,0:02:06.46,to write writing is the wrong word for

0:02:03.630,0:02:12.22,what I do okay

0:02:06.469,0:02:12.22,we all use it mm-hmm but I could pose

0:03:07.450,0:03:19.01,superior HD APN it.4 sunblock it's

0:03:15.430,0:03:19.01,possible for you to take a look at that

0:03:19.150,0:03:22.19,[Music]

0:03:31.890,0:03:38.04,you want me to play to the camera at all

0:03:34.090,0:03:41.76,pretty wonderful - you need some I need

0:03:38.049,0:03:43.20,this isn't it like going to go on PBS is

0:03:41.769,0:03:45.45,more archival and then I might you know

0:03:43.209,0:03:46.93,make some clips if I ever get a website

0:03:45.459,0:03:49.90,together yes hopefully it will happen

0:03:46.930,0:03:52.90,but okay so okay so we were saying that

0:03:49.900,0:03:55.48,you know the the you're saying that you

0:03:52.900,0:03:57.07,don't use the word composed rather than

0:03:55.480,0:04:00.22,right because that because you're using

0:03:57.070,0:04:02.23,a sort of our land and voice may be a

0:04:00.220,0:04:04.36,mechanism which is your body and so the

0:04:02.230,0:04:10.12,question that I do all of your book okay

0:04:04.360,0:04:13.93,I write longhand on paper I compose on

0:04:10.120,0:04:16.00,the computer or process of revising and

0:04:13.930,0:04:18.51,printout like most people internet very

0:04:16.000,0:04:21.03,frequently the Negro or even print out

0:04:18.510,0:04:21.81,stare what the scrolling on the printout

0:04:21.039,0:04:25.83,is

0:04:21.810,0:04:28.53,another fair draft either in my mind or

0:04:25.830,0:04:33.03,on the computer

0:04:28.530,0:04:36.21,yeah remember my grass dr1 so pump dr,
0:04:33.030,0:04:38.73,and I was not gonna last long then okay

0:04:36.210,0:04:42.54,I've gone up to Dr 87 I think in some

0:04:38.730,0:04:44.82,things I've gotten to be are 500 for the

0:04:42.540,0:04:47.88,filename and so and you're and you're

0:04:44.820,0:04:49.91,using word in this Microsoft Word and

0:04:47.880,0:04:53.22,when you're doing using sounding to use

0:04:49.910,0:04:56.22,I always get mixed up I think they call

0:04:53.220,0:04:59.31,it real Office for Mac and neo office

0:04:56.220,0:05:01.59,for Windows maybe it's the opposite oh

0:04:59.310,0:05:05.04,okay but it is it's a basically a word

0:05:01.590,0:05:07.65,processor like word okay okay um there's

0:05:05.040,0:05:09.54,also a neat one that I use for difficult

0:05:07.650,0:05:13.01,inside a lot of why don't use it or

0:05:09.540,0:05:16.22,enchantment I can't remember cold

0:05:13.010,0:05:18.44,something like yeeeeesss writer hmm I

0:05:16.229,0:05:21.87,could you get it yeah

0:05:18.440,0:05:24.09,I've heard of one called Scrivener no

0:05:21.870,0:05:28.43,this is this is I see this

0:05:24.090,0:05:28.43,state-of-the-art I think without me one

0:05:38.319,0:05:45.39,yes Lisa's NIS us writer pro and it's

0:05:42.669,0:05:49.93,terrific in all kinds of the library

0:05:45.399,0:05:53.46,formatting indexes and niece's Pro

0:05:49.930,0:05:56.61,nieces Pro yes so and when did you start

0:05:53.469,0:05:58.74,using that a couple years ago but I'll

0:05:56.619,0:06:01.99,juggle them I've got through phases or

0:05:58.749,0:06:05.08,for certain purposes duplex printing on

0:06:01.990,0:06:06.87,a non duplex printing printer I know how

0:06:05.080,0:06:10.13,to do it on word so those enough word

0:06:06.879,0:06:14.34,okay when a wife is all of the above but

0:06:10.139,0:06:18.12,I'm not loyal to any a peterward

0:06:14.349,0:06:19.95,software descent yep so but what I guess

0:06:18.129,0:06:21.52,what drove to getting the nieces with

0:06:19.959,0:06:22.83,somebody tell you this let me tell you

0:06:21.520,0:06:25.44,about it and you just thought I probably

0:06:22.839,0:06:30.96,did some web research okay but there are

0:06:25.449,0:06:34.50,things I didn't like about the Neo

0:06:30.969,0:06:38.94,office page numbering and headers

0:06:34.509,0:06:40.20,include seem clumsy to me okay and none

0:06:38.949,0:06:42.27,of these programs are super expensive

0:06:40.209,0:06:47.11,anymore you have any big investment yeah

0:06:42.279,0:06:49.65,the best one I've ever used was it's

0:06:47.110,0:06:52.20,like Betamax versus VHS it was excellent

0:06:49.659,0:06:54.66,but didn't have no followers wordperfect

0:06:52.209,0:06:58.95,well first of all I was worried it was

0:06:54.669,0:07:01.24,perfect and that doesn't always win the

0:06:58.959,0:07:04.24,marketplace no it does not I felt way

0:07:01.240,0:07:06.15,more perfect was been the 90 I think oh

0:07:04.240,0:07:09.18,I would hourly computer users I thought

0:07:06.159,0:07:11.76,when you started using it in the mid 80s

0:07:09.189,0:07:14.86,okay you know I wrote a computer I now

0:07:11.769,0:07:17.80,entertainment in the early 80s

0:07:14.860,0:07:20.28,mind will Caroline well yeah I just read

0:07:17.800,0:07:25.02,a new very informative article about my

0:07:20.289,0:07:27.00,will so although I'm kind of paper tiger

0:07:25.029,0:07:29.19,technical things that are feeling a lot

0:07:27.009,0:07:31.41,about computers I've had to do with them

0:07:29.199,0:07:34.47,and I've used them for a long time since

0:07:31.419,0:07:37.44,the early age I think it was 1980 okay

0:07:34.479,0:07:39.61,they asked me to start my wheel fine you

0:07:37.449,0:07:40.16,can tell how prehistoric how early that

0:07:39.610,0:07:42.68,was

0:07:40.169,0:07:44.96,but the brain of the computer that they

0:07:42.689,0:07:50.69,gave me to write it on yeah alien

0:07:44.969,0:07:54.38,computers it was an Atari do you miss

0:07:50.699,0:07:57.50,the Atari no I should remember that

0:07:54.389,0:08:01.31,monotone yellow black and yellow monitor

0:07:57.509,0:08:07.05,yeah the way more than anybody's big

0:08:01.319,0:08:08.58,flatscreen to get you in cement and for

0:08:07.050,0:08:10.97,a wall cotton anything I wrote to be

0:08:08.580,0:08:14.12,read on the screen I wrote on the

0:08:10.979,0:08:17.31,computer yeah and things I wrote meant

0:08:14.129,0:08:20.21,to be rid of paper I wrote on paper

0:08:17.310,0:08:22.90,either with a pen or with the mices

0:08:20.219,0:08:26.15,machine I've ever owned an IBM Selectric

0:08:22.909,0:08:29.09,what hey when did you on that I had a

0:08:26.159,0:08:31.46,Selectric in the 70s and the 80s I often

0:08:29.099,0:08:33.65,regret that I don't still on one yeah

0:08:31.469,0:08:36.00,and as such it was like a BMW it was

0:08:33.659,0:08:37.91,such an excellent machine yeah that golf

0:08:36.000,0:08:40.86,ball huh

0:08:37.919,0:08:43.39,and then it got this soft tape so you

0:08:40.860,0:08:48.20,could miss you could erase perfectly oh

0:08:43.399,0:08:51.54,the ink was so precise yeah that they

0:08:48.209,0:08:55.29,had a list of ribbon and you went to

0:08:51.540,0:08:59.76,that and backspace it listed the ink off

0:08:55.290,0:09:03.72,the page and solid machine just it was

0:08:59.760,0:09:06.26,supposed to do so well yeah obvious

0:09:03.720,0:09:08.51,advantage drugs reasons why electronic

0:09:06.269,0:09:11.33,why the computer took over right but

0:09:08.519,0:09:15.63,this IBM Selectric was a beautiful

0:09:11.339,0:09:17.31,machine okay I have not thought of it as

0:09:15.630,0:09:17.94,a beautiful machine before but I think

0:09:17.310,0:09:19.44,that's good to know

0:09:17.940,0:09:21.51,I have you ever use I've never really

0:09:19.440,0:09:24.06,used it so I can't say is amazing yeah

0:09:21.510,0:09:28.17,now I know I kind of want to go and find

0:09:24.060,0:09:31.56,one um my typewriter experiences are not

0:09:28.170,0:09:35.33,been very good well a crappy typewriter

0:09:31.560,0:09:37.82,is not yeah fun and anyone's now that I

0:09:35.339,0:09:42.50,end up looking at are using art out of

0:09:37.829,0:09:42.50,you know out of tune essentially yeah so

0:09:42.560,0:09:48.01,so you are a Windows user primarily but

0:09:45.750,0:09:50.68,with no I I've used to be

0:09:48.010,0:09:55.39,young primarily in iOS correctly

0:09:50.680,0:09:57.55,primarily in iOS Mac user and that is

0:09:55.390,0:10:03.46,then just a screen that's coming from

0:09:57.550,0:10:05.11,the MacBook Pro this is okay uh and one

0:10:03.460,0:10:06.97,we're fine Megan's a kind of interested

0:10:05.110,0:10:09.82,in I used to go through the whole

0:10:06.970,0:10:14.02,rigmarole was syncing between my desktop

0:10:09.820,0:10:15.91,and my laptop yeah and I went to various

0:10:14.020,0:10:20.73,generations the best way to do that

0:10:15.910,0:10:25.06,right and now I'm not quite at the

0:10:20.730,0:10:30.40,totally cloud web system but yeah I

0:10:25.060,0:10:34.30,realized that nice external monitor

0:10:30.400,0:10:36.76,external keyboard external mouse I can

0:10:34.300,0:10:43.57,use the MacBook Pros what we used to

0:10:36.760,0:10:45.46,call the ICU right then we're on tired

0:10:43.570,0:10:48.67,use it that way I just said remember to

0:10:45.460,0:10:50.98,reject the backup and then unplug all

0:10:48.670,0:10:52.90,that stuff any crab and then I put go to

0:10:50.980,0:10:55.38,the airplane with it yeah I'm not

0:10:52.900,0:10:58.33,sticking with anything it's itself yeah

0:10:55.380,0:10:59.92,do you have mean when you when you save

0:10:58.330,0:11:01.66,your files you have like a Dropbox

0:10:59.920,0:11:03.10,account or a major event Dropbox

0:11:01.660,0:11:05.08,okay so you do have some sort of backup

0:11:03.100,0:11:09.64,in the cloud robot to can and I have a

0:11:05.080,0:11:13.18,two terabyte basically smaller wife and

0:11:09.640,0:11:14.80,record that backs up automatic okay

0:11:13.180,0:11:18.61,and have even how long have you been

0:11:14.800,0:11:25.81,doing the backups procedures for years

0:11:18.610,0:11:29.08,yeah and I'd like to vilify the company

0:11:25.810,0:11:32.89,to server French name that with the

0:11:29.080,0:11:35.86,backup failed really computer broke and

0:11:32.890,0:11:41.50,the I can't verify things fit with their

0:11:35.860,0:11:46.63,called I'm lacy now they've been Alessi

0:11:41.500,0:11:48.73,anyway that can happen to ya so what

0:11:46.630,0:11:50.86,happens there worries most stories but

0:11:48.730,0:11:53.85,only lost my book on yay so I walked

0:11:50.860,0:11:53.85,over yeah

0:11:53.900,0:12:01.50,it's about 79% bullshit and both of us

0:11:58.290,0:12:03.60,have given the manuscript to somebody or

0:12:01.500,0:12:07.26,have an earlier dress somewhere else

0:12:03.600,0:12:09.15,yeah it's never pure loss right most

0:12:07.260,0:12:12.96,things in life it's a matter of degree

0:12:09.150,0:12:15.24,yes that's true so what I mean what was

0:12:12.960,0:12:16.71,the loss there I can't remember can't

0:12:15.240,0:12:18.99,remember it wasn't I lost a bunch of

0:12:16.710,0:12:21.45,data I don't lose anything that I could

0:12:18.990,0:12:29.88,create or find in different orders of

0:12:21.450,0:12:31.86,some words okay you thought you sort of

0:12:29.880,0:12:37.02,went through with your first hand

0:12:31.860,0:12:38.40,submitting these questions right here so

0:12:37.020,0:12:39.81,it seems like you've been you've been

0:12:38.400,0:12:42.21,fairly adept at using a computer for

0:12:39.810,0:12:44.73,most of the time have you sought out any

0:12:42.210,0:12:46.59,any instruction or if it just did

0:12:44.730,0:12:50.94,something you caught yourself it's

0:12:46.590,0:12:53.64,mostly something I told myself adept is

0:12:50.940,0:12:56.10,a relative term compared to all the

0:12:53.640,0:12:59.78,other writers and poets I know I guess

0:12:56.100,0:13:03.96,on the deck compared to any

0:12:59.780,0:13:06.12,fifteen-year-old yeah I try harken well

0:13:03.960,0:13:06.87,but and I did you know that first

0:13:06.120,0:13:11.01,encounter

0:13:06.870,0:13:13.17,I've always liked Ganges yeah I never

0:13:11.010,0:13:15.36,was good at school but I would like

0:13:13.170,0:13:19.20,learning a certain kind of thing right

0:13:15.360,0:13:20.67,and I guess I'm the type that tends not

0:13:19.200,0:13:23.55,to like to read the instructions

0:13:20.670,0:13:26.40,I would rather figure it out yeah that's

0:13:23.550,0:13:29.34,two great personalities types in the

0:13:26.400,0:13:31.02,world I tend to be the Titan TSA's if I

0:13:29.340,0:13:33.81,can't figure it out I want to do it

0:13:31.020,0:13:36.84,great want after read instructions and I

0:13:33.810,0:13:38.73,did hang out with programmers when I

0:13:36.840,0:13:41.25,wrote my wills my introduction to

0:13:38.730,0:13:44.88,computer technology I did hear a certain

0:13:41.250,0:13:47.28,amount of jargon yeah and sometimes when

0:13:44.880,0:13:49.23,technologies are in primitive state you

0:13:47.280,0:13:51.39,learn more about from them and when

0:13:49.230,0:13:53.37,they're more perfected yeah one at one

0:13:51.390,0:13:54.75,time to drive a car you know something

0:13:53.370,0:13:57.97,about cars

0:13:54.759,0:13:59.74,people in the days of the term hi-fi

0:13:57.979,0:14:02.65,they had to know something about the

0:13:59.749,0:14:07.42,process even more to music and as they

0:14:02.659,0:14:08.98,improve the car and they improve some

0:14:07.429,0:14:10.96,people can be a nincompoop recording

0:14:08.989,0:14:16.24,music there's yes unless anybody needs

0:14:10.969,0:14:19.60,to know yeah um so how does it reminded

0:14:16.249,0:14:22.36,of a story about Burley was literally

0:14:19.609,0:14:24.52,like MSN Messenger roars where did you

0:14:22.369,0:14:26.20,read this with like AOL and the MSN

0:14:24.529,0:14:27.88,people were like going back and forth

0:14:26.209,0:14:30.19,like trying to kind of copy each other

0:14:27.889,0:14:31.81,saying this that the people at AOL

0:14:30.199,0:14:34.74,started programming and like the basic

0:14:31.819,0:14:37.15,basic basic level like its quality

0:14:34.749,0:14:39.52,operator processing or something like

0:14:37.159,0:14:42.49,huge huge you know huge amounts ones and

0:14:39.529,0:14:44.98,zeroes essentially yeah and so that that

0:14:42.499,0:14:46.36,sort of letting before assembly language

0:14:44.989,0:14:51.31,yeah no I think that yeah exactly

0:14:46.369,0:14:52.87,exactly see your yep um can you talk a

0:14:51.319,0:14:54.37,little bit more about how that came

0:14:52.879,0:14:56.47,about though how the mind will come

0:14:54.379,0:15:00.22,about I mean what where did it did it

0:14:56.479,0:15:01.90,were you added like a location that

0:15:00.229,0:15:04.48,would the programmers were near and they

0:15:01.909,0:15:06.94,contact you so typically how I was

0:15:04.489,0:15:08.32,sitting in my office at the University

0:20:06.070,0:20:11.95,I can focus a degree of confusion of the

0:20:09.010,0:20:12.43,movie and I told my standards had to do

0:20:11.950,0:20:15.34,it

0:20:12.430,0:20:16.18,it has nothing to relate to it here in

0:20:15.340,0:20:18.31,poetry

0:20:16.180,0:20:21.52,I have very short patients who think

0:20:18.310,0:20:24.58,they don't go to me like this and I can

0:20:21.520,0:20:29.02,be a difficult home by Marianne Moore or

0:20:29.020,0:20:37.84,tell immediately here

0:20:31.780,0:20:40.06,I'm enjoyment me or dad says the past

0:20:37.840,0:20:43.09,has been entering into the language of

0:20:40.060,0:20:44.59,different coasts and I think I've had an

0:20:43.090,0:20:47.14,epiphany in the last couple of years is

0:20:44.590,0:20:49.39,realizing that that is a process that

0:20:47.140,0:20:51.52,needs to happen right that each poet is

0:20:49.390,0:20:54.45,developing their own countries their own

0:20:51.520,0:21:00.06,language and you have to enter into that

0:20:54.450,0:21:02.38,zone customs its own language its own

0:21:00.060,0:21:05.29,presentation and once you get really

0:21:02.380,0:21:08.08,proves that country I know over

0:21:05.290,0:21:10.54,demanding to understand it when you

0:21:08.080,0:21:12.97,understood damage in football when they

0:21:10.540,0:21:14.68,drowned football then you don't need

0:21:12.970,0:21:20.65,that immediately have everything be

0:21:14.680,0:21:23.74,totally clear just like was gradual fall

0:21:20.650,0:21:26.44,in a foreign language I just wanted to

0:21:23.740,0:21:28.84,work particularly the flounder in a

0:21:26.440,0:21:31.51,common physical force it is I think

0:21:28.840,0:21:33.37,gravy with five or six pages of the

0:21:31.510,0:21:34.70,figure appendix he talked about

0:21:33.370,0:21:36.16,sentences

0:21:34.700,0:21:42.23,so it's like to hear a conversation

0:21:36.169,0:21:53.67,proposed or connotation so I know your

0:21:42.230,0:21:56.86,melody bike right what buddy said go and

0:21:53.679,0:21:59.77,part of the pleasure is gradually

0:21:56.869,0:22:02.41,getting more and more and then one group

0:21:59.779,0:22:05.77,and the sweet spot is just enough

0:22:02.419,0:22:10.26,difficulty and just enough human I know

0:22:05.779,0:22:12.95,- I could move it away

0:22:10.269,0:22:16.99,that's quite production we did recent of

0:22:12.950,0:22:19.51,which I D I did a lot of 10 or 1,
0:22:16.999,0:22:22.22,minutes many lectures yeah and then we

0:22:19.519,0:22:25.15,digital 30-minute discussions different

0:22:22.220,0:22:26.84,rotating cast and the lectures are in a

0:22:25.159,0:22:30.08,black box means goes into the black box

0:22:26.840,0:22:32.02,so that's the look of it yeah and it

0:22:30.080,0:22:34.24,doesn't look like school I hope it

0:22:32.029,0:22:37.63,doesn't look like classroom anyway no it

0:22:34.249,0:22:38.92,looks like a sort of performer yeah

0:22:37.639,0:22:41.29,blizzard I've been wanting to

0:23:07.879,0:23:13.54,were talking about mind wheel yes and

0:23:11.539,0:23:15.40,saying you went over to meet the

0:23:13.549,0:23:18.20,programmers and you and yes like and

0:23:15.409,0:23:22.34,when I wrote up a three or four

0:23:18.200,0:23:27.88,different plots hmm and the most far-out

0:23:22.340,0:23:31.78,one model vague way on dumb K the

0:26:21.710,0:26:28.97,I worried on the Atari you wrote it on

0:26:25.549,0:26:31.82,the Atari okay as I say for a good

0:26:28.970,0:26:33.35,period I was one of the few people in

0:26:31.820,0:26:35.17,the country that's right everything I

0:26:33.350,0:26:37.19,was writing threw me off the screen yeah

0:26:35.179,0:26:40.52,the computer everything was running

0:26:37.190,0:26:43.25,through your paper on paper okay and The

0:26:40.520,0:26:45.89,Times asked me to review a book of prose

0:26:43.250,0:26:47.53,by Philip Larkin mm-hmm I was having a

0:26:45.890,0:26:50.48,little trouble getting started with it

0:26:47.539,0:26:52.76,and I've been writing this very fluid

0:26:50.480,0:26:55.66,bubble world with a computer yeah I

0:26:52.760,0:26:58.61,couldn't get started on the large end so

0:26:55.669,0:27:02.41,I decided I'll experiment I'll see if I

0:26:58.610,0:27:04.46,can write the lead on the computer on

0:27:02.419,0:27:07.87,that monochrome to the socialist real

0:27:04.460,0:27:12.23,yeah that pen typewriter

0:27:07.870,0:27:16.03,manual and I want to brighten address

0:27:12.230,0:27:18.69,the whole fucking review on the Atari

0:27:16.039,0:27:23.66,yeah

0:27:18.690,0:27:25.97,I can't print it out the word dot-matrix

0:27:23.669,0:27:29.51,printers over there it's in ads yeah

0:27:25.979,0:27:32.22,like visiting synapse anyway and I did

0:27:29.519,0:27:34.22,have you may never have even seen one of

0:27:32.220,0:27:36.77,these I did have the five and a quarter

0:27:34.229,0:27:39.38,inch floppy oh yeah that's why they're

0:27:36.779,0:27:45.65,called floppies those things were fun

0:27:39.389,0:27:49.08,yeah they're flexible so I'm not sure if

0:27:45.659,0:27:51.86,mail is much used time I didn't email it

0:27:49.080,0:27:54.74,said no yeah I drove over to El Sereno

0:27:51.869,0:27:56.82,doe uh-huh and to that office park versa

0:27:54.749,0:28:05.90,at Ted its offices right next a little

0:27:56.820,0:28:08.12,company named pixel and I use my five

0:28:05.909,0:28:11.23,and a quarter inch floppy to print out

0:28:08.129,0:28:14.58,my book with you and the dawned on me

0:28:11.239,0:28:16.52,we're gonna have to get a printer in

0:28:14.580,0:28:23.07,fact you're gonna have to get a better

0:28:16.529,0:28:28.58,computer so within I can't remember

0:28:23.070,0:28:34.61,probably a few weeks I had a kooky

0:28:28.580,0:28:42.40,junkie dot matrix printer uh-huh and we

0:28:34.619,0:28:43.64,used to call a PC clone IBM clone called

0:28:42.409,0:28:45.77,Koroma

0:28:43.649,0:28:52.37,I think it was late nidalee oddly enough

0:28:45.779,0:28:53.54,yeah and so that was probably 1981 1980s

0:28:52.379,0:28:56.12,um thing is quite early

0:28:53.549,0:28:58.71,ya know me so you were already on your

0:28:56.129,0:29:00.21,second computer by early eighties first

0:28:58.710,0:29:00.57,one I own during the second one on the

0:29:00.210,0:29:08.07,season

0:29:00.570,0:29:09.50,okay second one movies um the so so I

0:29:08.070,0:29:10.97,mean just coming back then the impetus

0:29:09.509,0:29:13.49,for getting that first computer was it

0:29:10.979,0:29:15.11,from synapse did they they gave me the

0:29:13.499,0:29:16.49,guitar they gave you the Atari okay

0:29:15.119,0:29:18.09,that's what I'm just trying to come and

0:29:16.499,0:29:20.00,then they would when you were writing

0:29:18.090,0:29:21.74,for them you would take who you sold

0:29:20.009,0:29:23.10,electronics it's all electronic

0:29:21.749,0:29:25.74,programmers

0:29:23.100,0:29:28.59,route they took their assembly language

0:29:25.740,0:29:31.22,Nathan the program they invented would

0:29:28.590,0:29:38.37,have been Targa ya later Kathy matança

0:29:31.220,0:29:40.98,we have invited this that program called

0:29:38.370,0:29:45.03,bgz better dings org okay

0:29:40.980,0:29:47.90,and they would just put these I remember

0:29:45.030,0:29:53.01,William was sort of over programmer and

0:29:47.900,0:29:55.16,the personal one I my partner with Steve

0:29:53.010,0:29:57.78,Hales it says on the package of mine

0:29:55.169,0:30:00.51,wheel mine real an electronic novel by

0:29:57.780,0:30:03.17,Robert Pinsky writer William the tug and

0:30:00.510,0:30:05.54,Steve Hales programmers the packing I'll

0:30:03.179,0:30:11.37,tell your book okay the product is the

0:30:05.549,0:30:16.14,floppy right great and I'm in my first

0:30:11.370,0:30:19.67,conference with Steve said I want you to

0:30:16.140,0:30:22.13,describe your world me and we have these

0:30:19.679,0:30:27.33,interesting philosophical discussions of

0:30:22.130,0:30:29.82,rooms moving in space and scenes in time

0:30:27.330,0:30:33.00,and you think of the scene happening in

0:30:29.820,0:30:35.58,a room what you need alone happening in

0:30:33.000,0:30:41.88,the scene yeah

0:30:35.580,0:30:43.91,so there's an interest in conversation

0:30:41.880,0:30:47.34,yeah yeah I mean I've been sorting the

0:30:43.919,0:30:48.80,first well and dialogue table uh-huh

0:30:47.340,0:30:50.64,things like that

0:30:48.809,0:30:54.78,I really conversations about virtual

0:30:50.640,0:30:58.79,spaces yeah and coming out of some

0:30:54.780,0:31:01.26,narratives and practice uh so you know

0:30:58.799,0:31:03.90,let's swing back a little bit I mean

0:31:01.260,0:31:07.61,like before all this like when you were

0:31:03.900,0:31:10.44,in your early early writing career which

0:31:07.610,0:31:11.73,would you say is like right around the

0:31:10.440,0:31:13.77,time when you went to Stanford when you

0:31:11.730,0:31:15.65,sort of started writing I mean I mean I

0:31:13.770,0:31:18.29,read some of the interviews and some of

0:31:15.659,0:31:20.73,that I thought of myself as a writer

0:31:18.299,0:31:23.15,bunch of Records okay as an

0:31:20.730,0:31:23.15,undergraduate

0:31:25.679,0:31:32.86,this a beatnik wannabe I was writing

0:31:31.059,0:31:36.55,through iPhones as editor the

0:31:32.860,0:31:38.02,undergraduate for a magazine oh so no I

0:31:36.550,0:31:39.55,had a writing line okay

0:31:38.020,0:31:41.05,and so when you when you were starting

0:31:39.550,0:31:43.98,off I mean what was what were your

0:31:41.050,0:31:46.00,practices like when were you writing on

0:31:43.980,0:31:48.61,like did you keep notebooks

0:31:46.000,0:31:51.91,did you I've never kept notes or got

0:31:48.610,0:31:55.42,another note maker yeah I get an idea

0:31:51.910,0:31:58.30,for phone mode right it

0:31:55.420,0:32:02.55,I remember my for a while I shared an

0:31:58.300,0:32:05.20,apartment with Alan juice novelist does

0:32:02.559,0:32:07.03,book reviews where PR yeah how long is a

0:32:05.200,0:32:11.47,year ahead of me and Alan's a fiction

0:32:07.030,0:32:17.26,writer and I remember hearing his type

0:32:11.470,0:32:19.71,article I'm sitting there maybe with a

0:32:17.260,0:32:22.63,paper pen thinking trying out different

0:32:19.710,0:32:29.44,phrases in my mind yeah and sort of

0:32:22.630,0:32:31.90,ending that yeah and so I said always I

0:32:29.440,0:32:33.94,mean I been since that time and

0:32:31.900,0:32:36.19,throughout that kind of you've always

0:32:33.940,0:32:38.32,kind of felt it as a sort of boy storoe

0:32:36.190,0:32:40.05,thing in your head before anything I

0:32:38.320,0:32:42.70,mean I got more and more confident in

0:32:40.059,0:32:46.24,yes that always was I felt that was my

0:32:42.700,0:32:48.67,métier yeah what I could do I felt not

0:32:46.240,0:32:50.67,everybody could do and to do with the

0:32:48.670,0:32:53.17,sounds and sentences like that think we

0:32:50.679,0:32:55.42,just watched on TV absolutely the

0:32:53.170,0:32:57.82,sentence of sentence is where you fouls

0:32:55.420,0:33:00.70,and consonants work together the way a

0:32:57.820,0:33:02.29,short sentence relates go along say how

0:33:00.700,0:33:03.88,did you come to how did you come to

0:33:02.290,0:33:07.99,figure out that you were as you could do

0:33:03.880,0:33:10.12,that better than other people probably

0:33:07.990,0:33:11.71,in the course of college but I could

0:33:10.120,0:33:13.72,remember that as a kid I would try to

0:33:11.710,0:33:16.78,tap out the rhythms of sentences with my

0:33:13.720,0:33:18.79,centenary son and I thought about things

0:33:16.780,0:33:21.25,like voiced and unvoiced consonants

0:33:18.790,0:33:22.44,before I knew the word from them yeah

0:33:21.250,0:33:28.54,think about that

0:33:22.440,0:33:33.50,between the th the under teaching Finn

0:33:28.549,0:33:36.45,you use your voice box think you don't I

0:33:33.500,0:33:38.97,wasn't sure it seemed like a bad habit

0:33:36.450,0:33:40.95,way yeah I thought about the sentence of

0:33:38.970,0:33:44.34,words the answer was not a surprise to

0:33:40.950,0:33:46.01,me that I was good at it when I

0:33:44.340,0:33:46.64,discovered there was a narc based on

0:33:46.019,0:33:49.32,such things

0:33:46.649,0:33:50.97,mm-hmm and I guess the question is then

0:33:49.320,0:33:52.47,how how you kind of develop I mean you

0:33:50.970,0:33:53.78,had that sort of innate talent and I

0:33:52.470,0:33:59.27,mean what were the steps you took to

0:33:53.789,0:34:01.44,develop that talent reading we had great

0:33:59.279,0:34:07.63,teachers my freshman English teacher was

0:34:01.440,0:34:07.63,Paul Fussell and mommy asked us to read

0:34:08.149,0:34:25.16,ABC a weeding by Ezra Pound I read me la

0:34:16.970,0:34:30.08,Ginsberg I recognized the way the words

0:34:25.169,0:34:33.78,were rooting to those writers Carlos

0:34:30.089,0:34:37.02,Williams and alternates and Emily

0:34:33.780,0:34:39.54,Dickinson I didn't post listen twisted

0:34:37.020,0:34:42.72,into differences among them right then

0:34:39.540,0:34:44.73,thing I saw going on I was impressed by

0:34:42.720,0:34:48.69,that thing yeah yeah that's such a

0:34:44.730,0:34:52.47,better way to get into them um so I

0:34:48.690,0:34:54.06,guess I you know when we started to kind

0:34:52.470,0:34:57.24,of you know compose the poems and and

0:34:54.060,0:34:58.82,they became more important to not only

0:34:57.240,0:35:00.48,well I mean important to you personally

0:34:58.829,0:35:03.00,but also important to like your career

0:35:00.480,0:35:04.44,and moving forward like how did you what

0:35:03.000,0:35:05.64,we were the ways of your work son where

0:35:04.440,0:35:07.41,they always kind of appearing in your

0:35:05.640,0:35:09.86,head you write them down by hand and

0:35:07.410,0:35:12.41,then type them up for other people and

0:35:09.869,0:35:14.09,what were the most privatised it is for

0:35:12.410,0:35:19.65,a long time

0:35:14.099,0:35:22.34,yeah certain sets of ideas like home the

0:35:19.650,0:35:25.73,same size histories

0:35:22.340,0:35:29.60,oh the first things you ever saw in a

0:35:25.730,0:35:37.88,damn plastic in your life clean cheap

0:35:29.600,0:35:48.29,shit poisonous plastic soldiers soldiers

0:35:37.880,0:35:49.91,during softens all set

0:35:48.290,0:35:51.83,everything's all set I really appreciate

0:35:49.910,0:35:53.60,it

0:35:51.830,0:35:56.42,this is just all trash from skin surface

0:35:53.600,0:35:57.62,with me taking my tracks always all

0:35:56.420,0:36:00.98,though I don't want to leave it up there

0:35:57.620,0:36:10.94,so look after JIT all right yeah one

0:36:00.980,0:36:13.49,year to those ideas that said why is

0:36:10.940,0:36:16.19,there one event different materials

0:36:13.490,0:36:19.58,what about plaque then I would take the

0:36:16.190,0:36:22.34,wordplay that's all just thoughts at the

0:36:19.580,0:36:25.91,same time you know I've been fixing up

0:36:22.340,0:36:29.00,my own personal history and hi my lesson

0:36:25.910,0:36:33.79,sort of soldiers pressed forward

0:36:29.000,0:36:43.37,soldiers out overnight and the do min

0:36:33.790,0:36:49.61,hold up mmm-hmm completely other set of

0:36:43.370,0:36:50.72,ideas might involve war and fascinated

0:36:49.610,0:36:53.99,war

0:36:50.720,0:36:57.29,and in the Battle of the Bulge

0:36:53.990,0:37:00.49,she's a radio man and I'm very tiny

0:36:57.290,0:37:02.96,being fascinated by his massive boots

0:37:00.490,0:37:05.18,he's wearing the boots and I wonderful

0:37:02.960,0:37:08.63,growth the ambolyn touching those big

0:37:05.180,0:37:11.80,boots and that's no that's the ball

0:37:08.630,0:37:15.47,right that's memories thoughts ideas and

0:37:11.800,0:37:19.36,then the problem is we start putting

0:37:15.470,0:37:21.44,some science together something

0:37:19.369,0:37:24.20,unnatural about the way as far as

0:37:21.440,0:37:27.74,soldiers one on the rain I'm like the

0:37:24.200,0:37:30.61,boots of my ecologist like movie live he

0:37:27.740,0:37:33.92,has not just bomb great yeah become

0:37:30.619,0:37:35.59,practical demo yeah the poem starts from

0:37:33.920,0:37:39.23,the start thinking about the vowels and

0:37:35.599,0:37:46.49,consonants and what's going to rearrange

0:37:39.230,0:37:48.95,the continents calendar and the calendar

0:37:46.490,0:37:51.74,of childhood were tied between the day

0:37:48.950,0:37:56.00,that you find that wooden soldiers get

0:37:51.740,0:38:00.84,run day you that your mother grandmother

0:37:56.000,0:38:07.54,both cream the truth was trouble

0:38:00.849,0:38:07.54,drooliet negligence negligence memory

0:38:08.460,0:38:14.13,that yes that's the mature that's mature

0:38:11.560,0:38:16.72,yeah and then so how you know in the

0:38:14.130,0:38:19.03,purpose of these interviews is kind of

0:38:16.720,0:38:22.21,to think about how that material becomes

0:38:19.030,0:38:23.65,the book and in all its iterations yeah

0:38:22.210,0:38:26.47,you know and how that and how that has

0:38:23.650,0:38:27.79,changed over the course of you know you

0:38:26.470,0:38:28.93,know how many computers do you think

0:38:27.790,0:38:30.49,you've oh I mean like and how many

0:38:28.930,0:38:32.29,different writing devices and stuff like

0:38:30.490,0:38:34.24,that so I mean it yeah

0:38:32.290,0:38:35.98,if you compose it in your head I mean

0:38:34.240,0:38:37.63,will you have hold pull poems in your

0:38:35.980,0:38:40.54,head before you don't know house but

0:38:37.630,0:38:43.09,more often I get enough for the muff

0:38:40.540,0:38:46.33,lines to want to make a draft okay so

0:38:43.090,0:38:48.37,I'll write them down yeah and look at

0:38:46.330,0:38:50.98,those recite to myself two different

0:38:48.370,0:38:53.29,things I have written down and then I

0:38:50.980,0:39:00.37,was I type it into a document you can

0:38:53.290,0:39:02.11,print out okay to get a new idea and how

0:39:00.370,0:39:03.79,was that I mean what was that like in

0:39:02.110,0:39:05.80,the early like in my like say the early

0:39:03.790,0:39:10.51,70s late 60s when you were working

0:39:05.800,0:39:13.12,computer yeah something came out of a

0:39:10.510,0:39:15.79,typewriter that has a lot of ballpoint

0:39:13.120,0:39:18.91,all over it same same sort of you'd have

0:39:15.790,0:39:22.27,to rely and you'd start it up and now it

0:39:18.910,0:39:27.40,comes out of a laser printer and as both

0:39:22.270,0:39:28.36,time all over yeah um what kite would

0:39:27.400,0:39:29.92,like when you're when you're actually

0:39:28.360,0:39:31.36,doing the writing down you don't you say

0:39:29.920,0:39:33.13,you don't usually use notebooks or

0:39:31.360,0:39:35.41,anything what what are you writing on is

0:39:33.130,0:39:38.88,it just their paper or yeah my favorite

0:39:35.410,0:39:38.88,kind of paper is very hard to get

0:39:40.140,0:39:48.22,I'm forced to use this out because it's

0:39:44.380,0:39:51.27,very hard to get this okay I don't like

0:39:48.220,0:39:54.49,the lines yeah yeah let's forget that

0:39:51.270,0:39:56.89,somehow society doesn't take this very

0:39:54.490,0:40:00.06,seriously yeah you can get white I don't

0:39:56.890,0:40:03.25,want to white you want to yell it I

0:40:00.060,0:40:04.39,think that is the best color white

0:40:03.250,0:40:05.82,yellow and black bird

0:40:04.390,0:40:09.28,I'm sorry yellow it's a bad night but

0:40:05.829,0:40:11.88,somehow more fluid yak and white yeah so

0:40:09.280,0:40:14.41,in black and white it feels sort of

0:40:11.880,0:40:16.63,legal or reductive and have you been

0:40:14.410,0:40:20.29,working with blank yellow paper if you

0:40:16.630,0:40:22.90,can since early yes we haven't talked

0:40:20.290,0:40:25.51,much about prose now I can remember

0:40:22.900,0:40:28.71,working on prose and going through what

0:40:25.510,0:40:31.06,and lots of different processes

0:40:28.710,0:40:35.92,technologically mm-hmm whiteout of

0:40:31.060,0:40:40.00,course yeah but I can remember before

0:40:35.920,0:40:43.48,the Ibn list off mm-hmm I remember using

0:40:40.000,0:40:46.42,the the even made it double-spaced as

0:40:43.480,0:40:52.39,well a single space I believe correction

0:40:46.420,0:40:55.08,tape yeah so you could you could take a

0:40:52.390,0:40:58.51,passage that you wanted to change and

0:40:55.089,0:41:01.51,you need to tape down and you might use

0:40:58.510,0:41:05.20,a Xerox machine and we would do whiteout

0:41:01.510,0:41:09.73,so the tape didn't leave without fail

0:41:05.200,0:41:13.00,gray out yeah and I can remember kind of

0:41:09.730,0:41:16.86,thick pounce esta pages where I had done

0:41:13.000,0:41:18.31,that on some piece of prose and that

0:41:16.869,0:41:20.65,would build up and build up until you

0:41:18.310,0:41:23.31,got it I think I think early drafts of

0:41:20.650,0:41:26.14,the situation of poetry yeah I was still

0:41:23.319,0:41:28.18,at that stage of the paper and the

0:41:26.140,0:41:31.03,whiteout partners we're getting a couple

0:41:28.180,0:41:35.23,other things I did yeah to save having

0:41:31.030,0:41:37.96,to retype something and now now I met an

0:41:35.230,0:41:40.08,editor who said she thinks prose decline

0:41:37.960,0:41:42.81,people started writing much more poorly

0:41:40.089,0:41:46.16,when the computer made it so easy to do

0:41:42.819,0:41:48.01,insert passengers mm-hmm

0:41:46.160,0:41:50.69,that said people rather than

0:41:48.010,0:41:52.94,concentrating and editing and cutting

0:41:50.690,0:41:54.50,and sculpting they're pros living to

0:41:52.940,0:41:57.92,insert that every sentence cutting

0:41:54.500,0:41:59.54,reloaded what do you think so in terms

0:41:57.920,0:42:01.16,of that same process what do you think

0:41:59.540,0:42:03.32,how do you think that affected poetry I

0:42:01.160,0:42:11.06,mean here specifically well I think

0:42:03.320,0:42:13.82,poetry took an unproductive turn when

0:42:11.060,0:42:17.99,people fell in love with the technology

0:42:13.820,0:42:21.08,of the typewriter and Traulsen look very

0:42:17.990,0:42:24.02,solemnly about how did new poet you

0:42:21.080,0:42:26.09,count the spaces proportional space and

0:42:24.020,0:42:33.35,came along within a decade or two yeah

0:42:26.090,0:42:35.63,and made nothing to that and to me the

0:42:33.350,0:42:37.85,graphic thing people talk about line

0:42:35.630,0:42:40.04,endings quite a lot yeah I already say

0:42:37.850,0:42:42.74,no I don't write line endings

0:42:40.040,0:42:45.83,I read lines yeah and it's the whole

0:42:42.740,0:42:49.13,line so that I guess you can say I'm

0:42:45.830,0:42:54.67,kind of an extremist and bird resistant

0:42:49.130,0:42:54.67,to the visual idea of the poem and

0:42:55.090,0:43:00.14,different technologies give people the

0:42:57.890,0:43:04.27,illusion than poetry support of graphics

0:43:00.140,0:43:10.37,and I guess for that it is unique for me

0:43:04.270,0:43:14.69,unique quality of poetry is that it is

0:43:10.370,0:43:18.32,vocal it's out of human scale yeah

0:43:14.690,0:43:21.08,it comes out of one person's body on

0:43:18.320,0:43:22.52,syllable at a time does that be anybody

0:43:21.080,0:43:24.89,else here I'm not talking about poetry

0:43:22.520,0:43:26.30,readings were praying straight talking

0:43:24.890,0:43:30.85,about things very similar to the

0:43:26.300,0:43:34.10,favorite poem project videos yeah so

0:43:30.850,0:43:35.99,technology the most important thing yet

0:43:34.100,0:43:39.86,to be done it's amazing to me it hasn't

0:43:35.990,0:43:42.08,done yet yep porky I was a chancellor

0:43:39.860,0:43:44.06,the Academy of American poets and they

0:43:42.080,0:43:46.52,brought to us very proudly Christian

0:43:44.060,0:43:49.52,slurs to see somebody made a program

0:43:46.520,0:43:53.27,where the words of a poem can scroll and

0:43:49.520,0:43:54.58,jump around see words do that on TV yes

0:43:53.270,0:43:58.66,every day

0:43:54.580,0:44:00.97,in Spain only why don't they correct the

0:43:58.660,0:44:04.27,fact that spell I think FSG won't

0:44:00.970,0:44:07.90,publish poems in a electronic ego

0:44:04.270,0:44:09.49,condition because somehow nobody's come

0:44:07.900,0:44:12.12,up with a way to preserve the integrity

0:44:09.490,0:44:14.74,of the lines yeah

0:44:12.120,0:44:16.24,sees me you could get a team of

0:44:14.740,0:44:19.69,programmers to do that in a couple of

0:44:16.240,0:44:22.42,days I am up for battle but probably

0:44:19.690,0:44:25.03,going to happen tomorrow yeah but at the

0:44:22.420,0:44:27.46,moment it's in this particular stage

0:44:25.030,0:44:29.80,where it hasn't happened yeah

0:44:27.460,0:44:33.55,on the other hand Horace didn't have

0:44:29.800,0:44:35.26,visual lines they were just didn't make

0:44:33.550,0:44:39.25,spaces between the words they wanted to

0:44:35.260,0:44:41.56,save parchment or wax or papyrus or

0:44:39.250,0:44:43.24,stolen whatever they were using yeah so

0:44:41.560,0:44:45.04,it's just you could figure out where the

0:44:43.240,0:44:50.41,lines were because the rhythms were so

0:44:45.040,0:44:53.14,strong yeah so for your own for your own

0:44:50.410,0:44:55.39,work then I mean when did you how do I

0:44:53.140,0:44:56.74,mean you have a very strong sense and

0:44:55.390,0:44:58.60,you would like Judith Michael sort of

0:44:56.740,0:45:00.58,soon have that strong sort of aural

0:44:58.600,0:45:02.74,sense of poetry in turn are very

0:45:00.580,0:45:05.20,dedicated to it do you think did that

0:45:02.740,0:45:07.24,come out of working with the winters I

0:45:05.200,0:45:08.98,mean did that come out of or did that

0:45:07.240,0:45:12.15,come out of kind of innate sense of what

0:45:08.980,0:45:17.13,you were doing for my date I think

0:45:12.150,0:45:25.02,there's some moment when I was reading

0:45:17.130,0:45:30.85,how could seventies antium and Dickinson

0:45:25.020,0:45:34.06,and I felt this reality in those things

0:45:30.850,0:45:36.85,it was different from the reality of

0:45:34.060,0:45:40.66,Alan's typewriter going staccato I was

0:45:36.850,0:45:46.93,different from the reality of reading

0:45:40.660,0:45:49.12,Ulysses or governor's in that was very

0:45:46.930,0:45:53.21,powerful reality produced by those

0:45:49.120,0:45:58.73,rectangular blocks of print and pages

0:45:53.210,0:46:03.23,this was more physical in some way more

0:45:58.730,0:46:07.97,bodily let's say yeah so maybe maybe

0:46:03.230,0:46:10.64,ripe for winters and he certainly

0:46:07.970,0:46:14.66,amplified it by inviting me to learn

0:46:10.640,0:46:17.21,something about George Gascoigne fault

0:46:14.660,0:46:21.95,Greville Philip Sidney yeah

0:46:17.210,0:46:26.86,Rolly but I think it happened when I was

0:46:21.950,0:46:30.10,in my late teens still and Ginsberg was

0:46:26.869,0:46:34.33,obsessed by Blackburn soon my Elliot

0:46:30.109,0:46:36.58,gave himself these exercises in it so it

0:46:34.339,0:46:39.07,was as is Williams in a completely

0:46:36.589,0:46:44.02,different way it was reversed I was

0:46:39.079,0:46:47.66,intensely horrible which has all those

0:46:44.029,0:46:49.40,poems called metric figure obviously

0:46:47.660,0:46:52.19,metric figures but their attempts to

0:46:49.400,0:46:55.09,write intense rhythms they're not I am

0:46:52.190,0:46:59.18,this I am ik Yan Lang first yeah and

0:46:55.099,0:47:01.57,that that move away from that you know

0:46:59.180,0:47:06.71,is such a interesting particle

0:47:01.579,0:47:08.75,centripetal okay let me let me give

0:47:06.710,0:47:15.65,actually some gone a little bit further

0:47:08.750,0:47:17.02,than so I guess you know I mean a

0:47:15.650,0:47:18.95,question the kind of overarching

0:47:17.029,0:47:23.05,question that I'm wondering is you know

0:47:18.950,0:47:24.71,they add and has a digital librarian

0:47:23.059,0:47:26.99,someone who's working in the dado new

0:47:24.710,0:47:29.48,who has mostly you know who can't really

0:47:26.990,0:47:31.60,remember ever not writing on a computer

0:47:29.480,0:47:33.38,or not you know not using that we win

0:47:31.609,0:47:34.97,that when that when that computer came

0:47:33.380,0:47:36.31,in when you know the news how he came in

0:47:34.970,0:47:38.29,when the screen started appearing in

0:47:36.319,0:47:40.86,front of you and and the ease of those

0:47:38.299,0:47:43.03,deletions and insertions and

0:47:40.869,0:47:45.58,rearrangements became possible I mean

0:47:43.039,0:47:49.06,did did that change the way worker that

0:47:45.589,0:47:51.89,changed what you produced I don't think

0:47:49.069,0:47:55.70,it change where I produced good I think

0:47:51.890,0:47:56.51,that the beginning of different kind of

0:47:55.700,0:47:59.71,archive

0:47:56.510,0:48:07.78,anxiety hmm there's the are kaga anxiety

0:47:59.710,0:48:07.78,about paperwork's being preserved yeah

0:48:08.170,0:48:17.11,Giddins magnascribe person is insane so

0:48:10.910,0:48:20.77,if you destroyed the generation receive

0:48:17.119,0:48:27.35,magazines that I have working yeah

0:48:20.770,0:48:30.23,that's the old anxiety the new anxiety

0:48:27.350,0:48:32.99,is the mortality each other information

0:48:30.230,0:48:35.30,yeah I can remember the librarian of

0:48:32.990,0:48:37.88,Congress saying to me that the only way

0:48:35.300,0:48:44.45,to preserve digital material is to

0:48:37.880,0:48:47.63,reproduce it unlike papyrus hmm it's

0:48:44.450,0:48:51.35,more it turns to mush

0:48:47.630,0:48:55.04,yeah that's aside from the fact that the

0:48:51.350,0:48:59.06,media keeps changing yeah favorite poem

0:48:55.040,0:49:00.38,project videos today I talked about

0:48:59.060,0:49:05.57,somebody's going to take the original

0:49:00.380,0:49:07.58,digital tapes and make them into current

0:49:05.570,0:49:10.43,high-definition format okay

0:49:07.580,0:49:13.91,rather than flash format during therapod

0:49:10.430,0:49:15.26,yeah on the website the website will be

0:49:13.910,0:49:21.71,enhanced you'll be able to make them

0:49:15.260,0:49:25.22,fullscreen okay well I for seven years I

0:49:21.710,0:49:26.35,saw the news hour with Jim Lehrer Frank

0:49:25.220,0:49:30.38,Sinatra died

0:49:26.359,0:49:33.26,I read passages from Virgil about the

0:49:30.380,0:49:34.10,death of the singer and the stock market

0:49:33.260,0:49:39.58,was in trouble

0:49:34.100,0:49:39.58,I read Frost's provide provide huh

0:49:39.750,0:49:48.03,at the time the places I recorded those

0:49:42.470,0:49:50.97,give me dumps and VHS tape where are

0:49:48.030,0:49:54.72,they who are the where where's that

0:49:50.970,0:49:57.15,material yeah it's a lot of yeah I'm

0:49:54.720,0:50:00.39,anxious that we've gotten to either

0:49:57.150,0:50:03.72,I was a poetry editor slate for many

0:50:00.390,0:50:06.11,years even they eventually found poetry

0:50:03.720,0:50:09.03,just stop bringing up hits enough money

0:50:06.119,0:50:11.64,add things they stopped doing it to

0:50:09.030,0:50:16.40,preserve it for a while there in years

0:50:11.640,0:50:21.11,when I would do a poem out of copyright

0:50:16.400,0:50:23.04,classic yeah my well it probably

0:50:21.119,0:50:29.28,Marianne Moore it's how I was introduced

0:50:23.040,0:50:32.79,to Pocono so I did those I was shocked

0:50:29.280,0:50:36.84,to learn I'm like oh there is almost

0:50:32.790,0:50:38.57,like all the kind of pornography and ads

0:50:36.840,0:50:44.36,and stuff

0:50:38.570,0:50:46.38,the God the Unruh truth mean those

0:50:44.369,0:50:49.10,discussions and some of you know

0:50:46.380,0:50:52.31,well-known poets and critics took places

0:50:49.109,0:50:52.31,and it's a yeah Martin

0:50:53.750,0:51:01.44,what what what part were they written

0:50:57.390,0:51:05.52,they were in the fray the discussion

0:51:01.440,0:51:09.34,part that is I'm funding to people how

0:51:05.520,0:51:12.15,the comment section below yeah so that

0:51:09.349,0:51:15.63,something quite valuable that I put

0:51:12.150,0:51:19.58,effort into yeah vanished

0:51:15.630,0:51:23.40,Oh will vanish will die trip n most

0:51:19.589,0:51:25.68,objects are destroyed and we don't know

0:51:23.400,0:51:28.17,how long sisters reputation will last

0:51:25.680,0:51:36.39,there is a large view yeah but there's

0:56:03.000,0:56:10.04,questions but it is germane now I can

0:56:05.250,0:56:13.53,tell that there is no ultimate authority

0:56:10.040,0:56:16.16,for that selection process yes you also

0:56:13.530,0:56:16.16,include

0:56:23.220,0:56:30.46,in terms of then so kind of simply this

0:56:47.170,0:56:51.91,sort of I mean the word I've used before

0:56:49.990,0:56:53.56,here is like a dearness towards them or

0:56:51.910,0:56:56.68,do you feel that they're sort of just a

0:56:53.560,0:56:59.05,means to something else somewhere honors

0:56:56.680,0:57:02.26,mechanical the atom is unreflecting I

0:56:59.050,0:57:04.87,have many many folders I'm sort of a

0:57:02.260,0:57:08.41,quasi organized person okay so under

0:57:04.870,0:57:11.53,documents in my hard drive which is then

0:57:08.410,0:57:14.22,backed up in my backup drive under

0:57:11.530,0:57:18.45,documents here comes out on Piske home

0:57:14.220,0:57:23.56,of the steps in my documents there are

0:57:18.450,0:57:34.09,many many folders letters standard news

0:57:23.560,0:57:37.51,prose medical hey Alan J probably Syrian

0:57:34.090,0:57:40.65,capital okay this one called drafts yeah

0:57:37.510,0:57:44.52,and dress under subfolders

0:57:40.650,0:57:48.93,most problems is that dr one dr 12 dr

0:57:44.520,0:57:52.52,foreign key i look at it and i sometimes

0:57:48.930,0:57:55.71,feel the way I had told you I feel about

0:57:52.529,0:58:00.00,the family photographs yeah

0:57:55.710,0:58:05.16,nobody wants all this this yes

0:58:00.000,0:58:08.88,Crusoe say about the umbrella that was

0:58:05.160,0:58:10.44,so hard to make leather trousers gave

0:58:08.880,0:58:11.76,them to the local museum how could

0:58:10.440,0:58:15.53,anybody want such things

0:58:11.760,0:58:24.11,I'm sure she's thinking about brass yeah

0:58:15.539,0:58:26.76,yeah it's just another anxiety I can't

0:58:24.119,0:58:32.66,say I think about it a lot now but I'm

0:58:26.760,0:58:40.17,in visited when I think about all those

0:58:32.660,0:58:43.10,megabytes of drafts yeah and two

0:58:40.170,0:58:46.79,separate questions are do I want anyone

0:58:43.109,0:58:50.40,to look at them and possibly want to

0:58:46.799,0:58:53.88,look but I don't destroy them and I do

0:58:50.400,0:58:55.65,someone mechanically shoot the dress of

0:58:53.880,0:58:58.20,the dress I guess part of the theory is

0:58:55.650,0:59:02.36,I might never walk great and I suppose

0:58:58.200,0:59:03.96,once in many many months I do do and so

0:59:02.369,0:59:05.36,you're saving each poem at the new draft

0:59:03.960,0:59:06.90,you don't like that you don't have it's

0:59:05.369,0:59:09.48,not like one poem with many drafts in

0:59:06.900,0:59:13.04,its each palms a new a new file a new

0:59:09.480,0:59:16.70,draft a new folder no it's each poem for

0:59:13.049,0:59:16.70,a poem let's say the poem is called

0:59:17.569,0:59:25.28,mechanical pencil mountain then we have

0:59:21.839,0:59:29.33,a name like neck pencil yeah and with

0:59:25.289,0:59:35.75,uppercase MVP and you have AG mech

0:59:29.339,0:59:38.26,pencil PR 1x ok a pencil dr,
0:59:35.750,0:59:42.82,dot b

0:59:38.260,0:59:46.06,yeah pencil 47 and maybe not every

0:59:42.820,0:59:48.31,single one saying okay and they all go

0:59:46.060,0:59:52.66,to that fall poem okay and in the main

0:59:48.310,0:59:56.65,file which is the next book OPM whatever

0:59:52.660,0:59:58.99,that folder you have separate poems okay

0:59:56.650,1:00:01.15,and then have you been doing that your

0:59:58.990,1:00:03.55,whole when did you start using the sort

1:00:01.150,1:00:04.81,of folders over what I started doing but

1:00:03.550,1:00:09.10,it's been pretty ugly as soon as I

1:00:04.810,1:00:11.56,started using computer yeah and I mean

1:00:09.100,1:00:13.86,you feel like you kind of envision the

1:00:11.560,1:00:15.22,poems in that way that using this I mean

1:00:13.869,1:00:17.50,like when you're kind of like thinking

1:00:15.220,1:00:18.07,about them later does that ever pop into

1:00:17.500,1:00:23.34,your mind

1:00:18.070,1:00:23.34,I think about the poem I think about it

1:00:24.300,1:00:30.85,in my book or as part of my poetry

1:00:28.540,1:00:33.46,reading or funded which equally

1:00:30.850,1:00:36.25,grandiose and the hopeful state I

1:00:33.460,1:00:38.16,picture somebody reading it the way the

1:00:36.250,1:00:41.59,people in the favorite poem project

1:00:38.160,1:00:45.64,really set Rodney reads Platts dick in

1:00:41.590,1:00:49.63,the candlestick yeah um I was watching

1:00:45.640,1:00:53.74,the South Boston oh the kid time John

1:00:49.630,1:00:55.84,Doe John Ulric yeah that meets Quentin

1:00:53.740,1:00:57.73,book so we real cool I really and I was

1:00:55.840,1:01:00.28,all in that I know I was terrified how

1:00:57.730,1:01:02.23,much I wanted to know how he's doing you

1:01:00.280,1:01:03.52,know I was interested in him like I mean

1:01:02.230,1:01:06.04,I know the poem is great and everything

1:01:03.520,1:01:07.90,but it just may be but yeah and I heard

1:01:06.040,1:01:11.68,he was doing okay I hope so

1:01:07.900,1:01:14.91,good um when you're when you tote so I

1:01:11.680,1:01:17.32,guess I'm a little unclear on to how

1:01:14.910,1:01:19.66,like what your revision process is like

1:01:17.320,1:01:22.00,I mean you think I have a sense of how

1:01:19.660,1:01:24.64,the compositions happen and then when

1:01:22.000,1:01:26.41,you when you have say let's say most of

1:01:24.640,1:01:28.60,the poem ready I mean like when you're

1:01:26.410,1:01:30.73,moving from draft you know yeah Oh 22 Oh

1:01:28.600,1:01:33.49,21 like what what are you doing in

1:01:30.730,1:01:35.77,between there print up right on the

1:01:33.490,1:01:38.02,printer are you reading it out loudly if

1:01:35.770,1:01:40.24,you have the poem by gourry I might turn

1:01:38.020,1:01:41.80,white up going to try to recite the poem

1:01:40.240,1:01:43.63,is to come to a party or ahead and make

1:01:41.800,1:01:46.15,this before you need to work out okay

1:01:43.630,1:01:47.65,not reliably but sometimes yeah and

1:01:46.150,1:01:50.27,sorry are you do you have like an

1:01:47.650,1:01:52.67,intention in doing that I mean is

1:01:50.270,1:01:59.06,from different or is there yet intention

1:01:52.670,1:02:01.82,is to make it worse somebody getting by

1:01:59.060,1:02:05.00,heart or wanting to read to their friend

1:02:01.820,1:02:08.42,or wine to recite themselves on a high

1:02:05.000,1:02:11.33,for driving yeah do whatever it is the

1:02:08.420,1:02:14.11,poems too bright so you so kind of

1:02:11.330,1:02:15.59,realize that almost what happens when a

1:02:14.119,1:02:17.27,poem doesn't realize that I mean how do

1:02:15.590,1:02:23.96,you know that it poems not going to get

1:02:17.270,1:02:27.95,there in my case you keep working and

1:02:23.960,1:02:31.88,very rarely you abandon it usually so

1:02:27.950,1:02:34.31,part of it is worth it mm-hmm gets

1:02:31.880,1:02:36.83,incorporated into the next poem or to

1:02:34.310,1:02:39.89,some future time okay so it kind of

1:02:36.830,1:02:45.29,takes part you yes you use it like way

1:02:39.890,1:02:47.63,humans do parts and Chevrolet's okay

1:02:45.290,1:02:49.25,other people have working to other

1:02:47.630,1:02:53.00,people kind of enter into this process

1:02:49.250,1:02:58.42,yeah I have friends and uses what I

1:02:53.000,1:03:00.44,write should I write Gale major

1:02:58.420,1:03:03.28,different times of my life to be

1:03:00.440,1:03:05.69,different frames there's somebody around

1:03:03.280,1:03:08.63,signalled sometimes he may lose control

1:03:05.690,1:03:11.21,yeah and at what stage to these two

1:03:08.630,1:03:13.76,people usually come in fairly late

1:03:11.210,1:03:18.41,really late kind of get a reaction and

1:03:13.760,1:03:20.00,yeah my son what the was working like on

1:03:18.410,1:03:21.68,the translate was the translation work

1:03:20.000,1:03:23.54,and using the computer and these sort of

1:03:21.680,1:03:25.67,processes was it fundamentally different

1:03:23.540,1:03:31.79,or what did it share a similar it was

1:03:25.670,1:03:33.89,rather similar salt pen and I would

1:03:31.790,1:03:36.68,print out the Italian and a trot

1:03:33.890,1:03:39.08,whatever contra was working on mm-hm

1:03:36.680,1:03:42.29,so two or three pieces of paper maybe

1:03:39.080,1:03:45.91,one piece of paper everything I needed

1:03:42.290,1:03:48.61,yeah and then it was the metrical game

1:03:45.910,1:03:50.48,and you described that in my think I

1:03:48.619,1:03:52.49,what one of the interviews I've read

1:03:50.480,1:03:54.74,it's sort of like it's just a big

1:03:52.490,1:03:56.42,intensely pleasurable sort of work I

1:03:54.740,1:04:00.26,mean like what kept drawing you back to

1:04:20.530,1:04:26.51,difficulties or let's not say so

1:04:23.750,1:04:28.40,engage certain kind of difficult soon

1:04:26.510,1:04:31.58,because the video games often Richard a

1:04:28.400,1:04:36.46,trip you can't ever solve that you can

1:05:54.740,1:05:57.20,acquires a name with a book requires

1:05:56.510,1:05:59.84,some title

1:05:57.200,1:06:04.61,mm-hmm but it's the next book of prompts

1:05:59.840,1:06:09.38,and in that folder right now this is a

1:06:04.610,1:06:12.50,file call I think it's book 29 it's the

1:06:09.380,1:06:14.81,29th draft my father tab contents page

1:06:12.500,1:06:18.59,yeah

1:06:14.810,1:06:21.68,Jesus writer does very well of contents

1:06:18.590,1:06:22.73,page page numbers and the border coupons

1:06:21.680,1:06:26.87,right mm-hmm

1:06:22.730,1:06:28.49,and that order will change but what I

1:06:26.870,1:06:34.31,have with me if I go somewhere you the

1:06:28.490,1:06:39.34,poetry reading okay and it's a file it's

1:06:34.310,1:06:39.34,for how you construct your orders I

1:06:40.810,1:06:45.61,guess it's different for each book okay

1:06:48.820,1:06:54.97,I'm not really answer yeah I gave your

1:06:52.030,1:06:58.51,pants these a dissolute intuitive I mean

1:06:54.970,1:07:00.66,that does it have some sort of phrasing

1:06:58.510,1:07:04.71,to it I mean it's a musical and I spent

1:07:00.660,1:07:07.63,ideas and feelings get introduced yeah I

1:07:04.710,1:07:11.86,hope then make it developed and

1:07:07.630,1:07:13.96,amplified and explained and then I hope

1:07:11.860,1:07:18.58,do elements come in the course of that

1:07:13.960,1:07:21.55,process at the same time one recognizes

1:07:18.580,1:07:24.43,that a goodly number of readers don't

1:07:21.550,1:07:26.29,mean the poems in order then some people

1:07:24.430,1:07:29.53,like to start in the middle some people

1:07:26.290,1:07:33.37,start at the end but for those who want

1:07:29.530,1:07:35.20,to see something in your order golf

1:07:33.370,1:07:39.37,music starts with a kind of peak of your

1:07:35.200,1:07:42.31,title coin yeah says this is not going

1:07:39.370,1:07:45.97,to be easy mm-hmm and it's going to

1:07:42.310,1:07:53.73,involve the newspaper and it's not going

1:07:45.970,1:07:57.07,to date certain conventional poetry yeah

1:07:53.730,1:07:58.39,now I was I found I found the order the

1:07:57.070,1:08:00.76,ordering in the construction of golf

1:07:58.390,1:08:03.25,needs to be very unusual I mean I was

1:08:00.760,1:08:05.35,sort of extreme I was thinking about it

1:08:03.250,1:08:07.30,being just like unlike most things that

1:08:05.350,1:08:08.76,come out and I thought about a lot yeah

1:08:07.300,1:08:13.24,I didn't want to make it something

1:08:08.760,1:08:15.97,distinctive yeah and starts with the

1:08:13.240,1:08:21.58,most goes alight thing in the book yeah

1:08:15.970,1:08:23.17,yeah and so are you on draft 29 of the

1:08:21.580,1:08:25.33,current budget is that where you're at

1:08:23.170,1:08:26.85,okay if you have any idea when that

1:08:25.330,1:08:29.79,supposed is for me but you know when

1:08:26.859,1:08:32.00,you're someone leave next year okay I

1:08:29.799,1:08:36.00,hope this before the years over a book

1:08:32.009,1:08:37.99,um how I was teaching influenced the way

1:08:36.009,1:08:39.94,you write I mean has it done much or is

1:08:37.990,1:08:43.98,it sort of been the way that you support

1:08:39.940,1:08:47.25,the time that you get to do the writing

1:08:43.980,1:08:49.68,it's an easy question to answer

1:08:47.259,1:08:49.68,yeah

1:08:52.229,1:08:59.55,I'm proud of as profession it's an

1:08:56.049,1:09:02.19,honorable profession I think I have

1:08:59.559,1:09:07.21,probably helped more people than I've

1:09:02.199,1:09:09.42,heard people shouldn't see me be getting

1:09:07.210,1:09:17.38,something out of what I do as a teacher

1:09:09.429,1:09:18.48,I guess they help mask them to make

1:09:17.380,1:09:20.67,anthologies

1:09:18.489,1:09:22.83,so I guess among other things they

1:09:20.679,1:09:27.03,helped me have a sense of what is

1:09:22.839,1:09:29.73,commonly esteemed yeah changes frighten

1:09:27.039,1:09:33.75,rapidity that every two or three years

1:09:29.739,1:09:36.78,the Canada's very different had that has

1:09:33.759,1:09:38.52,a guy mean has that rate increased and

1:09:36.789,1:09:40.98,in more recent years now that the

1:09:38.529,1:09:43.59,Internet is kind of may think eager

1:09:40.989,1:09:47.55,could be or it could be just as I get

1:09:43.599,1:09:50.10,older I more disturbed by this we're

1:09:47.559,1:09:52.42,delighted by it yeah yeah but it

1:09:50.109,1:09:59.11,certainly does suggest at the wheel of

1:09:52.420,1:10:01.44,fashion is along pretty well yeah and

1:09:59.110,1:10:04.11,then I think you know there's other

1:10:01.449,1:10:05.94,questions about kind of your

1:10:04.119,1:10:08.22,correspondent and I know you talked

1:10:05.949,1:10:10.30,about the anxiety of saving emails and

1:10:08.229,1:10:12.99,stuff like that I mean but before where

1:10:10.300,1:10:14.53,did you were you a big physical letter I

1:10:12.999,1:10:16.57,understand you're used to writing a lot

1:10:14.530,1:10:19.44,of letters yeah it needs to be a would

1:10:16.570,1:10:20.94,warm up I remember working on the

1:10:19.449,1:10:23.82,situation of poetry

1:10:20.949,1:10:26.73,I would warm up matter routine where

1:10:23.820,1:10:31.11,first I read a letter were two maybe

1:10:26.739,1:10:34.11,three and that would somehow look we

1:10:31.119,1:10:36.30,feel I was working yeah that the glide

1:10:34.119,1:10:39.88,into working on a poem or in that Proust

1:10:36.309,1:10:41.94,project it was somehow made easier and I

1:10:39.880,1:10:44.07,used to get a lot of letters and sent a

1:10:41.949,1:10:48.61,lot of letters as something once in a

1:10:44.079,1:10:50.82,while yeah but electronic is taking over

1:10:48.610,1:10:52.74,when did that was like what you can you

1:10:50.829,1:10:58.11,point to a time when that that sort of

1:10:52.749,1:10:59.17,wave overtook I think in the late 80s

1:10:58.119,1:11:02.89,early

1:10:59.170,1:11:05.71,okay people who you think wouldn't ever

1:11:02.890,1:11:08.44,death female adapted to you now became

1:11:05.710,1:11:10.78,more horrible from cursing people and

1:11:08.440,1:11:18.19,come became the Agora yeah came where

1:11:10.780,1:11:25.17,people met and the generation that only

1:11:18.190,1:11:29.29,did paper correspondents old died be

1:11:25.179,1:11:31.98,blunt about it yeah yeah do you find the

1:11:29.290,1:11:33.16,bitch is different is it a different job

1:11:31.989,1:11:34.81,I mean is it like if you find that

1:11:33.160,1:11:37.23,there's different like interesting

1:11:34.810,1:11:40.81,different convention yeah I must say

1:11:37.239,1:11:45.91,that when I see letters I wrote long ago

1:11:40.810,1:11:49.19,I winced I don't like it why why not the

1:11:45.910,1:11:54.55,theater 92 cave was falseness so

1:11:49.199,1:11:56.05,clumsiness to write a good letter in a

1:11:54.550,1:11:59.19,way of not think about how you're

1:11:56.050,1:12:01.15,sounding or looking it should be

1:11:59.199,1:12:03.46,ephemeral should be at the moment yeah

1:12:01.150,1:12:06.31,and then to have it preserved for 2,
1:12:03.460,1:12:08.59,years we would deserve yeah any do you

1:12:06.310,1:12:10.51,think that there's more of an awareness

1:12:08.590,1:12:13.98,of that would email like more more of a

1:12:10.510,1:12:16.12,like a I think email is probably more

1:12:13.989,1:12:17.73,unconscious I'm Clinton I was joking

1:12:16.120,1:12:19.44,with you about my friend who says

1:12:17.739,1:12:27.10,scandalous things in emails yeah

1:12:19.449,1:12:30.48,repeatedly to look out yeah things you

1:12:27.100,1:12:35.17,read in the newspaper were some business

1:12:30.489,1:12:35.86,setting or political setting people get

1:12:35.170,1:12:39.75,nailed

1:12:35.860,1:12:42.82,oh we got an email trail yeah

1:12:39.750,1:12:45.61,it may be generational maybe something

1:12:42.820,1:12:48.96,exchanging I think people say things in

1:12:45.610,1:12:51.21,email they wouldn't say quote in writing

1:12:48.960,1:12:55.42,because they don't think of it as having

1:12:51.219,1:12:59.62,as much permanence yeah and sometimes it

1:12:55.420,1:13:03.94,surprises them so I think it's pretty

1:12:59.620,1:13:05.71,and you promised me my first time out of

1:13:03.940,1:13:08.62,college as a paralegal I just looked

1:13:05.710,1:13:10.48,through emails after email that you know

1:13:08.620,1:13:17.09,Surya hotbox as I

1:13:10.489,1:13:20.51,like yeah and hitting delete doesn't

1:13:17.090,1:13:27.34,doesn't say oh yeah oh no it doesn't

1:13:20.510,1:13:32.75,shred it no so kind of you know more

1:13:27.340,1:13:34.25,overall I mean do you think the advent

1:13:32.750,1:13:36.83,of the kind of computer in the rise of

1:13:34.250,1:13:39.89,the computer in your sort of practice

1:13:36.830,1:13:41.57,has changed things fundamentally or like

1:13:39.890,1:13:43.37,what what is the computer I never really

1:13:41.570,1:13:45.17,lived you were still with working with

1:13:43.370,1:13:47.23,your IBM so education is different

1:13:45.170,1:13:49.10,publication we've been talking about

1:13:47.239,1:13:52.16,production yeah and productions change

1:13:49.100,1:13:54.17,someone yeah for me probably not as much

1:13:52.160,1:13:56.51,as many people probably said doing it so

1:13:54.170,1:14:03.59,long with the computer right and because

1:13:56.510,1:14:06.23,poetry for me is a bowl publication

1:14:03.590,1:14:10.48,mm-hmm this is some kind of tremendous

1:14:06.230,1:14:15.17,transition yeah I don't think anybody

1:14:10.489,1:14:18.07,knows where it's going exactly but what

1:14:15.170,1:14:21.17,reason we spent a few days in New York

1:14:18.070,1:14:23.90,it's pleasing to see the people with a

1:14:21.170,1:14:29.78,book in the subway a magazine or a

1:14:23.900,1:14:32.21,newspaper yeah but most people who are

1:14:29.780,1:14:35.60,looking at something are we going to

1:14:32.210,1:14:41.23,screen yeah I'm surprised how many are

1:14:35.600,1:14:44.63,looking at tablets yeah lots are looking

1:14:41.239,1:14:47.93,phones and said a number of playing

1:14:44.630,1:14:52.43,games certain number of checking their

1:14:47.930,1:14:53.63,email certain number was music and

1:14:52.430,1:14:57.29,looking at something that goes through

1:14:53.630,1:14:58.42,the music how many are reading I don't

1:14:57.290,1:15:00.94,know

1:14:58.420,1:15:04.34,yeah but

1:15:00.949,1:15:05.63,at the moment if it magazine tells you

1:15:04.340,1:15:09.41,they want to put something in their

1:15:05.630,1:15:14.11,webpage rather than print you feel was

1:15:09.410,1:15:18.53,your second level of affection for this

1:15:14.110,1:15:20.81,that may be shifting yeah yeah no I I

1:15:18.530,1:15:23.12,wonder about that too I feel yeah it's

1:15:20.810,1:15:25.73,right on that cut I think it's all it's

1:15:23.120,1:15:27.32,all very fluent and we don't know not

1:15:25.730,1:15:32.27,only anybody reads quite sure what's

1:15:27.320,1:15:34.94,going to happen egg yeah I guess one has

1:15:32.270,1:15:37.19,to not think about it too much

1:15:34.940,1:15:39.50,yeah looks you have to make those

1:15:37.190,1:15:41.36,physics right and it is I mean your

1:15:39.500,1:15:43.58,point about the formatting and about

1:15:41.360,1:15:46.28,them not figuring that out yet that's

1:15:43.580,1:15:48.67,going to happen so yeah but I mean even

1:15:46.280,1:15:50.17,in you know even in HTML I mean you know

1:15:48.679,1:15:52.58,even if you see your palms get put up

1:15:50.179,1:15:54.94,there there's so many obviously so many

1:15:52.580,1:15:56.75,like prop like I mean it's just easy to

1:15:54.949,1:15:57.80,easy problems but you know just don't

1:15:56.750,1:15:59.71,know because there's so many different

1:15:57.800,1:16:02.03,levels of previa right like you can see

1:15:59.719,1:16:04.94,late one up an ad would disrupt a poem

1:16:02.030,1:16:06.80,oh yeah yeah just kind of like like

1:16:04.940,1:16:12.34,break a line in a weird way or something

1:16:06.800,1:16:12.34,like that maybe a famous poem yeah not

1:16:12.880,1:16:16.82,are we almost done

1:16:14.510,1:16:19.25,yes I'm getting little warning I think
